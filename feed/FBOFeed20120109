<DESC>The Government contemplates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C., to acquire critical services necessary to satisfy U.S. military and intelligence space launch requirements. Those services include, but are not limited to, the following: procurement and production of launch vehicle hardware; mission integration and assurance; program management; systems engineering; transportation of launch system components; launch site operations and support; factory support; essential infrastructure support; and any EELV launch-related special studies. This effort is a continuation of EELV launch services currently being performed by United Launch Services, LLC under existing contracts.<br /><br />The Air Force intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-(a)(iii)(B). Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, in particular, for the continuation of highly-specialized services. Based on an evaluation of Statements of Capability submitted in response to the Request for Information issued on 6 May 2011 for this effort,&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;concluded that currently only the incumbent, United Launch Services LLC possesses both the capability and experience necessary to meet the requirements for EELV-class National Security Space (NSS) missions as outlined in the EELV System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD).&nbsp;The Government&nbsp;recognizes, however, the likelihood of competition in the future and the Government intends to promote competition at the earliest point practicable. The Government may elect not to award any EELV effort (described above) as a result of the solicitation.<br /><br />Interested parties were given the opportunity to identify their interest and technical capability and submit Statements of Capability in response to the Request for Information posted on 6 May 2011. The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposal. Responses and participation from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor otherwise pay for information which is submitted as a result of this notice.

<DESC>This scope of work establishes requirements for services pertaining to the monitoring, sampling, data analysis, and data collaboration of groundwater wells at the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) Open Burning (OB) and Open Detonation (OD) areas. Waste Military Munitions are destroyed by burning and underground detonation at the OB<br>and OD areas. There are currently eight groundwater wells to be monitored on a semiannual basis, all of which are currently in ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit. Additional wells may also be monitored for groundwater water elevations based on the requirements of state environmental regulators. A statistical evaluation will be completed to determine if statistically significant evidence of contamination above background levels at each monitoring well exist within 45 calendar days after completion of each sampling event. If statistically significant evidence of contamination exist above background levels sampling of Appendix IX to part 264 of 40 CFR compounds will be required in addition. Annual groundwater reports are also required within this scope. This scope includes the above monitoring activities and any other groundwater activities that may result from the site's continued operation based on ANAD's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit and state/federal environmental regulations. This solicitation is for a base and four one year options. This is an unrestricted procurement. North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hard copies will not be provided. Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (Army Single Face to Industry). Estimated issue date is 24 January 2012. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder's mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.

<SUBJECT>A--Presolicitation notice for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for Sampling Stations for Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL).
<SOLNBR>N6264512R0013
<CONTACT>N/A N/A See Description
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) on behalf of the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) has a requirement for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to support the mission of NSMRL in protecting the health and enhancing the performance of our War Fighters through focused submarine, diving, and surface research solutions. 

NSMRL is a component of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED). The contractor shall aid in continuing to research the health effects of the enclosed submarine atmosphere through execution of the Submarine Atmosphere Health Assessment Program (SAHAP).  The SAHAP program deploys passive chemical dosimeters (sampling stations) onboard operating US Navy submarines to determine concentrations of various compounds in the atmosphere; then compares them to established Navy 90-day limits.
  NSMRL requires contracted laboratory support to manufacture and analyze the custom chemical dosimeters that are required to sample the atmosphere in the dynamic submarine environment, on an as-needed basis. 
The Government envisions a single award ID/IQ contract, in which Task Orders will be issued as the need for the sampling stations arises. NSMRL will order up to 1250 custom sampling stations from the contractor per year via the issuance of task orders.  The quantity and type of sampling stations in each order may vary.  Custom Sampling Stations ordered by the government shall be manufactured and delivered within three (3) weeks of the order date.  NSMRL shall return the samples to the contractor following the exposure period for analysis.
  Analysis of custom sampling stations that are returned to the contractor after exposure shall be completed within three (3) weeks of receipt.  Upon completion of analysis, the contractor shall report the outcome of the analysis in the form specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) contained in the solicitation. 
The contract will consist of a base and four option years.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. This requirement is a full and open competition with no set-asides. A solicitation will be posted on or about 1 February 2012 to the Naval Medical Logistics Commandâ€™s website at http://www.nmlc.med.navy.mil/DBU-RFP.asp .
  Pre Solicitation notices are posted to FBO.gov and NECO.gov with a link to the website where the solicitation will be posted. Solicitations are to be downloaded from the website and no solicitations will be mailed. All proposals shall be sent to the address specified in the solicitation. 
Please email any questions to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil. No phone calls or faxes will be accepted. 
The Government reserves the right to change any of this information.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (DOI/OCIO), is seeking potential offerors in order to award a competitive Firm Fixed Price contract with a base period of one year and six option years. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be for a Cloud E-Mail and Collaboration Services (CECS) requirement and will be issued by the AQD on or around February 7, 2012. <br /><br />
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for the upcoming solicitation will be 541519 - "Other Computer Related Services" and will have a business size standard of $25 million.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement: <br />The Department of Interior is pursuing the acquisition of cloud-based email and collaboration services from a commercial provider in order to transition its current email from disparate, on-premise systems to an integrated, cost-effective, cloud solution. The ideal solution will provide the tools and capabilities needed to increase productivity with the Department's 88,000 e-mail users by modernizing and transforming the way they conduct business. The system should also provide administrators and information technology managers the ability to monitor service performance, quality, and delivery.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />&bull; Standardize all 88,000 DOI personnel on a common e-mail and collaboration platform to give all DOI employees improved communication and collaboration tools.<br />&bull; Benefit from the economies of scale inherent within a DOI enterprise-wide procurement which capitalizes costs for commercially available services previously managed at a bureau level.<br />&bull; Reduce costs for the Department's current e-mail and collaboration tools<br />&bull; Empower DOI employees with modern, reliable communication tools in a secure environment<br />&bull; Provision services in a government community or private cloud solution that includes cloud-based email, calendaring, email archiving, journaling, instant messaging, desktop video conferencing, and support for mobile devices <br />&bull; Reduce the Department's in-house system maintenance burden and associated spending<br />&bull; Ensure appropriate security and privacy safeguards</p>
<p>The CECS solution should also:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide features, functionality and capabilities that meet industry performance and interoperability standards and best practices<br />&bull; Offer the necessary redundancy, resiliency, and contingency capabilities to meet DOI's service availability needs<br />&bull; Improve user experience and productivity<br />&bull; Provide a secure computing environment that complies with all required federal regulations and DOI specific security requirements <br />&bull; Allow for a transition of the Government cloud data by providing full accessibility and data portability (to another cloud or in-house platform) upon contract completion.</p>
<p>This action will be primarily solicited in accordance with FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Items" and FAR Part 15, "Contracting by Negotiation."</p>
<p>AQD anticipates soliciting this requirement through the federal Business opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) on or about February 7, 2012 under RFP number D12PS00041. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site for all procurement related information and must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.</p>
<p>Be advised that it is the offeror's responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the due date specified within the forthcoming Request for Proposal. Reference the RFP number and project title on all correspondence. The RFP will contain all requirements and instructions so qualified offerors can submit electronic proposals to the Contracting Officer/Branch Chief Gregory Ruderman (Greg.Ruderman@aqd.nbc.gov) and the Contract Specialist, Brian Baker (Brian.Baker@aqd.nbc.gov).</p>

Based on the complexity and level of detail involved in the payment of patent maintenance and annuity fees, it is not feasible for a new Contractor to assume responsibility for such a brief period of time and meet the deadlines for paying the maintenance and annuity fees for the United States and foreign countries.&nbsp; The current Contractor, Computer Packages, Inc. has already undertaken on behalf of the Government the tracking of cases in order to maintain the patents in the United States and foreign countries and would continue to provide the service.&nbsp; The United States and each foreign country have different requirements, timeframes, and fees to pay. Failure to follow the appropriate steps will cause the U.S. Government to lose intellectual property rights in the United States and the foreign countries. Such a loss has a serious and direct effect on the Government.
<p>As noted above, this is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.&nbsp; However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.&nbsp; The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements of the Statement of Work and the terms and conditions of the current contract.&nbsp; Capability statements and related materials must be received by Sheryn N. Etti, Contracting Officer, no later than November 28, 2011, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; Written responses received after November 28, 2011, at 12:00 PM Eastern Time will not be accepted.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. &nbsp;Address responses to the attention of Sheryn N. Etti at the National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions via email at ettis@mail.nih.gov.</p>

DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The areas of proposed work will be in Mississippi and the Florida panhandle region, as currently managed by NAVFAC SE.
  The work will be concentrated at, but not limited to the following locations: Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC) Gulfport, Keesler Air Force Base (AFB), Naval Air Station (NAS) Meridian, Naval Support Activity (NSA) Panama City, NAS Pensacola, and NAS Whiting Field.

4) Bonding capacity: Provide suretyâ€™s name, your firmâ€™s maximum bonding capacity per project, and your firmâ€™s aggregate maximum bonding capacity.

5) Identify whether your firm is a self-certified Small Business or SDVOSB, or an SBA certified 8 (a) or HUBZone firm.  If your firm is an 8(a) or HUBZone firm, provide proof of SBA certification.

In addition, OPP requires contractor support to complete Pesticide Product Label System (PPLS) notification review and data extraction within the Pesticide Registration Information System (PRISM) via the Label Use Information System (LUIS). Using PRISM-LUIS, the selected contractor will perform tasks associated with the management and operations of the LUIS label analy sis, extraction functions and operations.   
A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod. To evaluate the potential number of vendors capable of adequately performing under the DDMS/LUIS PWS, a thorough review of capability statements will be conducted.

Each of the garages will be new 900-space (approximately) multi-level parking structures, constructed adjacent to the new facility being designed.  Further, surface parking lots with a capacity of 700 spaces (approximately) will be required as part of this project.  

Approximately nine (9) existing buildings totaling about 48,000 GSF will be demolished to provide usable ground on the southeast portion of the campus for the new building and parking structures. 

Once a thorough analysis of the Medical Center's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.

Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.

The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and VA Program Guide PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.  

The contract will include a government option for: design-build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits.

The completed project should be capable of achieving LEED Silver and/or GBI Green Globes certification.  

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed, with additional experience with vertical expansion/integration along with phasing of on-going operations will be considered.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the firm's, or teams', Quality Assurance /Quality Control procedures.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  
In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.
Applicants must have an established working office within 100 mile radius of Lexington, Kentucky, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Kentucky.

<DESC><p>TITLE: Local Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Hosted Payload Industry Day Announcement and Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>SOLICITATION #: N/A</p>
<p>DUE: NLT 0800 PDT on 5 March 2012</p>
<p>POCs: Capt Oesa Weaver, (310) 535-2683, (oesa.weaver@us.af.mil) and Barbara Golf, (310) 535-2692, (barbara.golf.ctr@losangeles.af.mil), Technical Advisors; Capt Christian Balmaceda, Procurement Contracting Officer, (310) 535-2657, (christian.balmaceda@losangeles.af.mil).</p>
<p>DOCUMENT TYPE: Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1 OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The Space Superiority Systems Directorate (SMC/SY) is soliciting information on a potential acquisition strategy, contract structure, data processing, and payload interface concept of operations for a future hosted payload. This hosted payload would be focused on local Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Of particular interest are any technical or contractual plans that may inhibit the widest possible dissemination and deployment of this SSA payload, impose undue risk, or create execution issues.</p>
<p>SMC/SY is also announcing its intent to host an Industry Day on 2 February 2012 to discuss SMC/SY's approach to implementing the Local SSA Hosted Payload.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES A CALL FOR FEEDBACK ONLY. DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>This is a request for information purposes only. As such, it is not a commitment on the part of the SMC/SY for any specific work. Responses to this RFI do not ensure participation in any future actions.</p>
<p>2 LOCAL SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The topic of the Industry Day is an overview of a potential government design for local space situational awareness as well as a possible concept for its operation. A response to this RFI is requested so that the government may receive feedback on the information that will be presented at the Industry Day. A detailed agenda is available on the registration webpage for the Industry Day.</p>
<p>Payload Mission Description:</p>
<p>SKIPRAY is a space protection technology development program managed by SMC/SY to provide local SSA. It is a scalable hosted-sensor suite for integration onto a spectrum of geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellite hosts. As a hosted sensor, SKIPRAY relies on the host to provide electrical power, thermal stability, attitude determination and control, ground communications, etc. SKIPRAY is designed with the intent to not adversely affect the host space vehicles' ability to accomplish their mission objectives.</p>
<p>Concept of Operations:</p>
<p>SKIPRAY is intended to be a standardized payload for use on all US government buses, at a minimum, with potential to expand to all US commercial and possibly foreign commercial GEO satellites. It represents an affordable, low risk, low impact step into the space protection and hosted SSA world.</p>
<p>3 INDUSTRY DAY INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Offerors interested in participating in the Industry Day must pre-coordinate their visit with SMC/SY security and the Industry Day POCs. In order to meet security requirements, the following registration process must be completed by 1600 PDT on 19 January 2012.

<DESC>Special Notice W15QKN-12-Z-D003  Bore Cleaning System
The U.S. Army Contracting Command, New Jersey-Emerging Technologies (USACC-NJ-ET), located at Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY 12189 on behalf of the US Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Commands (ARDEC) Benet Laboratories intends to award on a sole sourced basis a purchase order to Arnold Defense and Electronics, LLC., 3000 Arnold Tenbrook Rd. Arnold, MO,  63010.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 811310 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million.
The Government has a need that requires a supply contract to provide a new bore cleaning system, which includes 155mm and 105mm brushes.  At this time, the US Army ARDEC Bent Labs current method of cleaning requires a team of individuals to work together forcing a ramrod up and down the barrel.  It is both labor and time intensive.  With this new cleaning system, one soldier can perform cleaning with far better results while his team members are performing other critical tasks.  This will allow for superior allocation of resources infield and in the maintenance shops.  
AUTHORITY: This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only OneResponsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government; but this notice of intent, is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  The closing date for this synopsis is 23 January 2012 16:00 Eastern Standard Time. The point of contact for this requirement is Giuseppe Tropiano, USACC-NJ-ET, Bldg. 40, Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY 12189-4000.  Email:  giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil  
APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to Arnold Defense and Electronics because they are the only known suppliers of the equipment to our specifications. The Airnesco Bore Cleaning System (BCS) provided by Arnold Defense and Electronics is the only system, currently on the market, that meets all the requirements to immediately implement the use of a bore cleaning system into the Armys Technical Manuals. This is due to the fact that it has been field tested by the US Army and the British Royal Navy.  It is the only unit that has been field tested and uses no gas or electricity and does not require the use of cleaning chemicals.  The use of chemicals is not permitted without compatibility testing to ensure there is no impact on the bore diameters surface, before using any chemicals in the bore, these chemicals would have to go through a timely and costly array of chemical capability tests.

<DESC>Special Notice W15QKN-12-Z-D004 - Pyrometer
The U.S. Army Contracting Command, New Jersey-Emerging Technologies (USACC-NJ-ET), located at Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY 12189 on behalf of the US Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Commands (ARDEC) Benet Laboratories intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to MERPhotonics, 3 Rue Alphonse Merrheim, St. Etienne, Rhone Alpes, 42100, France. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334513.
The Government has a need that requires a supply contract to procure a commercial high speed multi-wavelength pyrometer for measuring real-time surface temperatures during millisecond laser pulsed heating.  This new high speed multi-wavelength pyrometer system is to be installed for Bent Labs, Armament Technology Division, Fatigue and Fracture Analysis Branch in Bldg 115.  The pyrometer shall be a multi-wavelength system to measure surface temperatures of unknown emissivity with acquisition times in microseconds in order to develop a temperature profile for a millisecond heating pulse. The pyrometer shall have software to process the raw data and convert it to a temperature profile.
AUTHORITY: This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only OneResponsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government; but this notice of intent, is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  The closing date for this notice is 19 January 2012 16:00 Eastern Standard Time. The point of contact for this requirement is Lauren McDermott, USACC-NJ-ET, Bldg. 40, Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY 12189-4000.  Email:  lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil .
APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: MERphotonics has demonstrated that they are the only entity that can provide this technology at this time. Nearly all commercial pyrometers have response times far too slow for the requirements of this notice, or do not provide high speed with multi-wavelength capability. We require a pyrometer that can measure a surface temperature profile of a surface of unknown emissivity, over a period of several milliseconds, with a response time of at most 100 microseconds.  Most pyrometers have too slow a response time to get even a single data point during the entire duration of our experiment.  MERphotonics has demonstrated the acquisition of a single measurement in a short time is possible, as well as acquisition of several measurements to form a temperature profile over several milliseconds, which is required.

<DESC>VAMC Cleveland Phone System Upgrade Emergency Procurement Sole Source Requirement
The Cleveland VA Medical Center (VAMC) Wade Park campus has begun experiencing intermittent busy signals during peak calling times at the Wade Park campus' main phone number 216-791-3800. This is time-sensitive, emergent, and a critical installation impacting the Veterans ability to contact Cleveland VAMC main campus, medical staff and medical services. This is a direct effect of end-of-life technology limiting capacity and from the recent consolidation of the Wade Park and Brecksville campuses. OIT Cleveland worked with our contracted telephone support vendor to determine the scope and cause of the problem. The problem has been determined to be this piece of specific equipment called an "Auto-Attendant" which is unable to handle the increased demand of phone traffic in-bound to the Wade Park campus. In order to expedite resolution of busy signals experienced by Veterans calling into the Cleveland VA Medical Center this portion of the procurement is deemed emergent, necessary, and essential to increase capacity to accommodate this increase in phone traffic experienced by the Cleveland VAMC. This Voice System installation is necessary in order to support and upgrade the existing legacy Auto-Attendant telephone systems at the Cleveland VAMC main campus. Accordingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10701 East Boulevard, Cleveland, OH 44106, intends to award a sole source Purchase Order to the current inplace vendor Standard Communication, Inc., 5402 Leeds Manor Road, Hume, VA 22639, an SDVOSB, will be utilized to ensure compatibility with existing equipment in the VAMC Cleveland Phone System. Questions may be addressed by email to: christopher.blazejewski@va.gov

The Department of the Navy (DON) is hosting an Industry Day from 0900 â€“ 1100 on 25 January 2012 with sidebar sessions to be offered after the main session.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation PR42181 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55 dated January 3, 2012. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500.<br />CDC intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement: <br />&bull; One (1) UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system<br />&bull; Shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system</p>
<p>The system will be used for the development and implementation of analysis methods for measuring aflatoxin levels in tobacco products. Upon completion of this assignment, this system will also be used for the development and implementation of analysis methods to maintain continuity of measurement of nutritional biomarkers. To ensure that our laboratory is fully meeting its public health mandate it is critical that we possess the best possible measurement tools for developing biomonitoring assays. This will enable our laboratory to provide better identification of bioactive dietary compound exposure sources, higher statistical power in studies, and ensure the generation of robust, scientifically valid epidemiological data. The procurement of the state-of-the-art UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system is essential to accomplishing these goals.<br />The procurement of UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system will serve both immediate identified needs for biomonitoring analyses and be a key part of our laboratory infrastructure for developing future methods. It is impossible to predict the exact needs of future biomonitoring projects; therefore, it is imperative that we obtain UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system with the best possible combination of performance attributes and functionality to serve any possible biomonitoring endeavor. To accomplish this, we have identified both a list of minimum technical requirements for the candidate UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system as well as developed a list of criteria that will be used to evaluate potential (see attached). Each criterion has been ranked in terms of its relative importance to the whole UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system. <br />The proposals are due on January 24, 2012 at 8:00 a.m., EST. All proposals are to be submitted electronically to Pellumbeshe Hoxhaj @ kfx2@cdc.gov. Please provide any questions in writing electronically to the aforementioned e-mail address by January 17, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. EST. No telephone calls concerning questions regarding the RFP will be accepted. <br />The proposals may be in any format but MUST include: company's name, address, phone and tax identification number (TIN) and DUNS #; point of contact's name, phone, and email; proposal number &amp; date; item price, shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system; total price; applicable discounts; timeframe that the proposal is valid; delivery schedule-FOB destination; warranty information (if applicable); completed FAR 52.212-3, Representations and Certifications. <br />PROVISIONS/CLAUSES</p>

In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>b. Past Performance Information: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance.

<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, identify the work the subcontractor will be performing if you are relying on the subcontractor's past performance.</p>
<p>c. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p><br />(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance <br />ii. Price</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

Only the types of materials listed above will be made available to the contractor by the government. The contractor shall furnish all other types of materials in the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) The contractor shall maintain adequate property control records in accordance with sound industrial practice and shall make such records available to the government inspection at all reasonable times. The contractor shall return all GFM not consumed in production to the U.S. Air Force Academy along with, or prior to, final delivery, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.<br />(5) All amount of GFM consumed in excess of the allowance per garment will be charged to the contractor at the per yard cost rate shown at (a)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Irreparable Rejects. The contractor agrees to purchase any or all irreparable rejects when notified in writing by the Contracting Officer, or his/her duly authorized representative, at the per yard rate for that particular garment as shown at (a)(1) above. The contractor shall remove or obliterate all labels referring in any way to the government, all other identification and all military insignia and ornamentation.</p>
<p>(c) Purpose of GFM: The contractor warrants that any fabric obtained from the government is required for use in connection with the garments to be furnished under this contract.</p>
<p>(d) Responsibility for GFM: The contractor assumes the risk of, and is responsible for, any loss or damage to GFM regardless of the cause, from the time the fabric is delivered to the contractor to the time it is returned to the government. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to obtain such insurance, as he/she may deem necessary, at his/her own expense.</p>
<p>(e) Deficiency or Delay in Furnishing GFM: The delivery or performance dates for the supplies to be furnished by the contractor under this contract are based upon the expectation that the GFM will be available for delivery to the contractor within the specified time. In the event the GFM is not available for delivery to the contractor by such time, the Contracting Officer will, if requested by the contractor, make a determination of the delay.</p>
<p><br />(1) In the event the contractor believes that damages or defective GFM, exclusive of normal imperfections, has been furnished, or in the event of shortages, narrow widths, or other discrepancies, the contractor shall immediately notify, in writing, the damage, defect, or discrepancy to the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall not cut or use such Government Material, or in the event the damaged, defect, or discrepancy is such that it could not reasonably have been discovered until after cutting or further processing, the contractor shall not further process the Government material until instructions have been received from the CO. If replacement is to be made, the government will replace at its own expense, including transportation costs, any such damaged or defective material. If the contractor fails to notify the CO within five (5) days of discovery of any defect or discrepancy in the GFM, no equitable adjustment will be made in the delivery or performance dates, or the contract price.</p>
<p><br />(2) In cases of delay or failure to furnish any or all of the GFM, or in case the government has furnished damaged or defective material, the CO, upon written request of the contractor, shall equitably adjust the delivery or performance period, or the contract price or both. The Government may, at its option, require sworn statements in support of such a request for an equitable adjustment. If the contractor does not request such an adjustment within 30 days from the time the contractor either knew or should have known of any such delay or deficiency in the GFM, no adjustment will be made. Under no circumstances will the Government include as an element of any adjustment under this "Explanatory Note" any amount for loss of prospective profits. Further, the provisions for adjustment are exclusive, and the Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract by reason of any delay or deficiency in furnishing GFM to the contractor.</p>
<p><br />(3) Fabric containing normal deficiencies shall not be considered defective. Any claim for shortage within the roll shall be adjusted as follows: for shortages on individual pieces only, credit will be taken by the Government for the minus tolerance provided for individual pieces in the "Examination for Length" paragraph of the fabric specification; for the entire shipment found to be longer than the length specified on the piece ticket. Narrow widths shall be subject to adjustment only where the discrepancy exceeds &frac14; inch. Measurements shall be "overall" or "exclusive of selvage", in accordance with the width provision of the applicable fabric specification.</p>
<p><br />(f) Protection of GFM, Title, Access. The contractor shall maintain and administer, in accordance with sound industrial practice, a program for the maintenance, protection and preservation of Government material, until disposed of by the contractor in accordance with this contract.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights- <br />(1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and <br />(2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. <br />(b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. <br />(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. <br />(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. <br />(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. <br />(f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. <br />(g) Invoice. <br />(1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices.

The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings. <br />(i) Payment.- <br />(1) Items accepted.

If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall- <br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the- <br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); <br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; <br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and <br />(D) Contractor point of contact. <br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. <br />(6) Interest. <br />(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due.

The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if- <br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days; <br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or <br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2). <br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. <br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: <br />(A) The date fixed under this contract. <br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. <br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on- <br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; <br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or <br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. <br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. <br />(j) Risk of loss.

The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties. <br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. <br />(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract. <br />(p) Limitation of liability.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-4<br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. <br />As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: <br />OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) <br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within the active performance period; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed January 31, 2017.</p>
<p>452.237 - 74 - Key Personnel.</p>
<p>As prescribed in 437.110(d), insert a clause substantially as follows: Key Personnel (FEB 1988) (a) The Contractor shall assign to this contract the following key personnel:</p>
<p>List of Custodial Staff</p>
<p>(b) During the first ninety (90) days of performance, the Contractor shall make no substitutions of key personnel unless the substitution is necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days after the occurrence of any of these events and provide the information required by paragraph (c) below. After the initial 90-day period, the Contractor shall submit the information required by paragraph (c) to the Contracting Officer at least 15 days prior to making any permanent substitutions.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions, complete resumes for the proposed substitutes, and any additional information requested by the Contracting Officer. Proposed substitutes should have comparable qualifications to those of the persons being replaced. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 15 calendar days after receipt of all required information of the decision on substitutions. The contract will be modified to reflect any approved changes of key personnel.</p>
<p>Addendum to 452.237 - 74 - Key Personnel.<br />Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) was issued on August 12, 2004 by President George W. Bush. HSPD-12 calls for a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of ID issued by the federal government to its employees and employees of federal contractors for access to federally-controlled facilities and networks. Based upon this directive, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) developed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS Pub) 201 including a description of the minimum requirements for a Federal personal identification verification (PIV) system. USDA's new HSPD-12 compliant ID is called the LincPass, as it is designed to link a person's identity to an ID credential and the credential to a person's ability to physically and logically access federally controlled buildings and information systems, respectively.<br />(End of clause) <br />Part II</p>

<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) <br />(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." <br />(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. <br />Other End Products:<br />Line Item No. Country of Origin <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />[List as necessary] <br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities<br />Key Personnel<br />Past Performance<br />Price</p>
<p>Technical, Key Personnel's ability to pass Security Clearance and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 <br />ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS <br />(a) Offerors shall submit information which clearly and concisely relates to the evaluation criteria in Part V, specifically addressing the following:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Contractor's technical capability to meet the Government requirement in accordance with the statement of work. <br />Demonstrate your technical capability by providing sufficient information, detailing your technical capability of meeting the specified requirements in the statement of work.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Qualifications of Key Personnel offered. <br />Identify the qualifications/background of the key personnel being utilized by completing the standard form 85 of all personnel that will be assigned to work on these Federal Facilities.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Relevant Past Performance. <br />Describe recent relevant similar efforts including description of the work performed, contract numbers, contact information, contract amount and provide references including phone numbers and or e-mail addresses. <br />The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from reference provided by the Offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other Government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases.<br /><br />If an Offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the Offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Price. <br /><br />PART V<br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision: <br />INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />(JUNE 2008) <br />(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard.

Please complete the attached Contractor's Qualification and Financial Information Sheet. <br />In order to preclude a conflict of interest, the vendor that provides the audit findings should not be the same vendor that recommends or implements the corrective actions that would result from the audit remediation services (currently Solicitation AG-3A75-S-12-0004). Thus, the awardee of the audit remediation solicitation will not be eligible to be the awardee of the financial statement and internal control audit services contract. <br />Instruction for Preparing Price Proposal: (a) Proposed price per deliverable shall be submitted by line item by each offeror for the required services. Pricing shall be included and provided for the one-year base term plus the three option years. Pricing will be based on the objectives and deliverables in the SOW. (b) Offerors are hereby notified that even if other cost or pricing data are not initially requested in this solicitation, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request such data if it is later found necessary. (c) Travel will not be submitted for the price proposal but will be invoiced monthly in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations and the Statement of Work. (d) Wages must be in accordance with the FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees : This provision requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional employees compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award. (e) Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed to show an inherent lack of technical competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. This may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal. The offeror's price proposal by line item is for evaluation purposes only.<br />CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION: All contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be awarded a contract. You may register easily and quickly online at www.ccr.gov or 1-888-227-2423.

<p>Contractors are required to have the capability to perform Cold Rolling of 54H60 propeller blades as specified in AFTO 3H1-18-3.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide Air Force Technical Orders (AFTO), drawings, or technical data related to this requirement. Quotes shall include the cover sheet/title page for the latest revision of the overhaul directive in the Contractor's possession for each item listed. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending Contractor registration or awaiting receipt of the overhaul directive.</p>
<p>These items are FLIGHT CRITICAL for the U.S. Coast Guard HC130H aircraft and are serial number tracked. Serial Number Tracked components will be shipped to the Contractor with a Significant Component History Report (SCHR) and a Component Repair Record (CRR). Upon receipt of component(s) the Contractor shall verify SCHR and CRR information with the part number and serial number on the component itself and verify the information against the applicable Purchase Order Line Item. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer when items are received and if a discrepancy is found, the Contractor shall provide written notification of the discrepancy to the Contracting Officer prior to any work being performed.</p>
<p>Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. Replacement parts shall be new Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts with traceability to the OEM for the particular part.

With the exception of parts listed on Attachment 1, parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be re-used. Parts replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.</p>
<p>USCG aircraft operate primarily around saltwater at low altitude and are subject to corrosion. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in any item or part thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made to the extent necessary to remove all corrosion or replace the part or parts affected. Corroded parts will be replaced except in those cases, where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) __Are, __are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) __Have, __have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) __Are, __are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) __Have, __have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror __does __does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Ms. Do Thuan Vi<br />Middle Airports Corporation<br />Da Nang International Airport <br />Da Nang City, Vietnam<br />Phone: +84.511.3823397 (extension 393) or +84-989963606<br />Fax: +84.511.3823393</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to Middle Airports Corporation (MAC) that will assist MAC in evaluating the transformation of Chu Lai Airport in Vietnam into a regional air cargo hub while expanding Chu Lai to accommodate increased passenger traffic, with an emphasis on the former.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that Vietnam could become the world's third fastest growing market for international passengers and freight traffic, and the second fastest for domestic passengers by 2014. Demonstrating this potential, Vietnam has plans to build or expand over 40 airports over the next 20 years. U.S. industry and foreign competitors have identified ten airports, which includes Chu Lai, that offer the most immediate and realistic commercial opportunities.</p>
<p>Located between two growing industrial provinces, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai, Chu Lai airport was originally used as a U.S. military base and opened as a civilian airport only in 2005. While today it serves approximately 40,000 passengers per year with 8-12 flights daily, the neighboring provinces have industrial business that include textiles, petrochemicals, steel lamination, shipbuilding, cement production and aluminum production with plans to expand industrial operations to an additional 35,000 hectares by 2025. Additionally, Quang Nam is home to two World Heritage sites attracting a growing number of tourists visiting the historical city of Hoi An and My Son ruins. Since 1991, Quan Nam's tourism has grown from 100,000 to 2.4 million visitors in 2010, and airport needs present a passenger growth demand and for Chu Lai.</p>
<p>To support growth, the provinces have developed infrastructure projects including highway access, deep seaport terminals, and economic trading zones connecting Chu Lai airport to the Ky Ha Port. In anticipation of expanded industrial airfreight needs, the Prime Minister has approved a program to expand Chu Lai airport. Although, the plans include passenger terminal expansion, the government has emphasized regional cargo services given the trading opportunities with neighboring Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Although MAC has received government approvals for the Chu Lai master plan, it needs to be further detailed to reflect realistic growth potential, considering the close proximity of the Da Nang airport. The Chu Lai master plan recommends two phases of development from 2015 to 2025 with a goal of providing capacity to four million passengers and five million tons of cargo. The first phase will develop the east side of the airport and include a second runway, taxiways, cargo terminal, navigation equipment, fire services, administrative/operational facilities and capacity for 25 aircraft at one time. The second phase will focus on the west side of the airport and increase capacity to handle 46 aircraft.</p>
<p>The proposed feasibility study would assess the potential passenger and cargo traffic, develop a business case for expanding the airport with emphasis on cargo services, identify the infrastructure and equipment requirements, establish a financial plan and phased investment program, identify potential private sector partners with emphasis on a build-own-transfer (BOT) scheme, and assess the development and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Airports in Vietnam are overseen by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV), and state-owned regional airport management corporations (Northern Airports Corporation, Middle Airports Corporation, Southern Airports Corporation). The Grantee, Middle Airports Corporation (MAC), has direct oversight and responsibility for airport development projects in the central region of Vietnam which includes Chu Lai and six other airports.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $US538, 886 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.

Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

The VA will re-procure services that cannot be performed by the Contractor.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C. <br /><br />8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations. The Program Office also provides support to ongoing country programs through managing country budgeting decisions and allocation of resources, and setting standards and providing guidance on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation. In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of State, and Congress.</p>
<p>The Program Office serves as a central processing point for budgetary and programmatic information, and also provides guidance and standardization of OTI and Agency-wide policies and regulations. The Program Office has regular interaction with country program teams, and reports directly to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The Program Office supports country program operations through improved strategic thinking, planning, and decision-making; instituting strategic budgeting; facilitating the design and procurement of new implementation mechanisms; and strengthening reporting, communications and outreach.</p>
<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program procurement and operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in the field, and also in the U.S. The Senior Management Advisor provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and expertise. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Program Office Team Leader or his or her designee, and spends the majority of his or her time supporting OTI country program implementation teams in the Field and in Washington. All of the field activities supported and the majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide a Senior Management Advisor to the Office of Transition Initiatives.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The Senior Management Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Management Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.

<p>&bull; At times, be available as a resource for other USAID offices or USG agencies when the work corresponds with the incumbent's experience, the scope of work, and with the clearance of the Supervisor and Office Director;</p>
<p>&bull; Review all OTI current and planned procurement processes supporting country program activities, including Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC), Purchase Orders, Cooperative Agreements, and Small Business IQCs to determine current capabilities and to recommend changes and modifications that will improve effectiveness of procurement planning for country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) and, when necessary, with USAID field Missions to ensure that adequate analysis of procurement issues has been conducted and that appropriate solutions are supported by Agency and U.S. government contracting regulations;<br /><br />&bull; Advise on the initiation of new procurement mechanisms, including indefinite quantity contracts, cooperative agreements, purchase orders, or other procurement formats that will support OTI country program work, and will ensure that the U.S. government may utilize the most cost-effective procurement mechanisms that are appropriate for individualized situations and country program needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise on, and if necessary coordinate, procurement activities and issues between OTI and OAA and Missions in the field, implementing partners, as well as DCHA, USAID geographic bureaus, the Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning, and Management Bureau on occasion;</p>

<p>&bull; Communicate with senior USAID and Department of State officials as appropriate to affect procurement decisions directly impacting OTI programming;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop relationships with USAID Mission senior management to ensure that OTI acquisition and assistance strategic planning and new initiatives related to OTI country programming are in sync with existing and new procurement policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and provide training modules and products for headquarters and field staff (both U.S. and foreign national as well as implementing partner staff) as needed to ensure that OTI staff have a full understanding of all Agency procurement procedures and regulations affecting their work;</p>
<p>&bull; Determine or define mechanisms and levels of procurement and program support for OTI Field Teams;</p>
<p>&bull; As needed, advise OTI managers on OTI and Agency procurement policies and issues and advise OTI country program staff on agency policies and regulations relating to procurement in a multitude of contexts;</p>
<p>&bull; Take initiative, act independently, and manage tasks with minimal supervision. Work with supervisor to develop deadlines, projects and work to be accomplished. Supervisor will set overall objectives.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: The Air Armament Center, Contracting Directorate, Operational Contracting Division, Base Operational Support Branch, 308 West D Ave Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB, FL 32542 is the contracting activity supporting this class Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED: <br />This is a class justification and approval (J&amp;A) that authorizes a three phased approach for award of treatment of wastewater collection. The phased approach will result in establishment of a utility service (FAR Part 41) contract with an Okaloosa County Water and Sewer (OCWS) 1804 Lewis Turner Blvd., Suite 300, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for treatment of wastewater collected from (1) Duke Field, (2) Eglin Main Base, and (3) Camp Rudder. The utility services contract will include connection charges (see FAR Part 41.101), capacity expansion charges, and recurring wastewater treatment charges. The connection charges are to cover the connecting facilities to be installed, owned, operated, and maintained by OCWS. The capacity expansion charges are to cover the OCWS costs for the plant treatment capacity needed for the new wastewater treatment requirement. Recurring wastewater treatment charges include customer service charges, readiness-to-serve charges, wastewater treatment usage charges, and other appropriate charges. The multi-phased project includes taking offline four (4) Eglin wastewater plants, and a force main extended to the 17-mile sewer pipeline from the 7SFG complex to Arbennie Pritchett Water Reclamation Facility APWRF.<br /><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS: The Government requires OCWS to collect and treat wastewater from Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder. This involves transporting the wastewater from points of demarcation at Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder to the APWRF) owned by OCWS. The government also requires OCWS to treat the wastewater at the APWRF. OCWS shall ensure adequate and dependable utility services to all facilities and equipment served. OCWS shall provide utility services in accordance with industry-standard construction, operations, maintenance, management, environmental, safety, and other relevant standards, that apply to similarly situated utility services providers serving customers whose service characteristics are comparable to the service characteristics of the installation. OCWS shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws/regulations. The Government anticipates awarding a 10-year utility service contract as described in FAR Part 41.205(d)(1). The total estimated value of the acquisition over the 10-year contract period is $40.834M. Each phase will consist of OCWS surveying, designing, obtaining permits, construction, and ownership/maintenance of the infrastructure. The construction work will be performed by OCWS in-house construction crews. OCWS will obtain proper easements from Eglin Real Estate. The following provides a description of each phase:</p>
<p>Phase I (Duke Field): Phase I will be executed in two phases: Phase IA will consist of providing a new lift station west of the existing runway and a 6.9-mles force main. The contract type will be firm fixed price and the period of performance is anticipated to be from 01 October 2011 through 30 April 2012. Award is anticipated to be in the last quarter of FY11. This phase will be executed upon initial award of the contract. Phase 1B will consist of providing the one-time capacity expansion charges and the recurring wastewater treatment charges. The contract type will be firm fixed price and the period of performance is anticipated to be from 1 April 2012 through 30 September 2021. Award is anticipated to be in the first quarter of FY12. Phase IB will be executed as a modification to the contract. The total anticipated price for Phase I is approximately $4.196M which includes: connection charge (one-time): $1.5M; capacity expansion charge (one-time): $1.1M; and wastewater treatment charges (recurring): $14K per month X 114 months = $1.596M.</p>
<p>Phase II (Main Base): Phase II will consist of providing a new lift station in the vicinity of each existing plant on the main base and a 3.0 mile force main, preliminary size is a 20-inch diameter line. Eglin's existing effluent main from the Plew Housing plant to the existing spray field will be utilized as a raw sewer transmission line from the new lift station at Plew to the new lift station at Eglin Main. The preferred 3.0 mile route goes through the JSF Runway Alternate II, therefore an alternate 3.9 mile route is also provided, west of the proposed runway location. This phase will be executed as a modification to the existing contract awarded under Phase I. The contract type will be firm fixed price and the period of performance is anticipated to be from 31 Dec 2012 through 30 September 2021. Award is anticipated to be in the first quarter of FY12. The anticipated price is approximately $31.502M which includes: connection charge (one-time): $5M; capacity expansion charge (one-time): $11.85M; and wastewater treatment charges (recurring): $132K per month X 111 months = $14.652M.</p>
<p>Phase III (Camp Rudder): Phase III will consist of providing a new lift station in the vicinity of the existing plant and an 8.5 mile force main, preliminary size is a 6 inch diameter line. <br />This will be executed as a modification to the existing contract awarded under phase I. The contract type will be firm fixed price and the period of performance is anticipated to be from 31 December 2012 through 30 September 2021. Award is anticipated to be in the first quarter of FY12. The anticipated price is approximately $5.136M which includes: connection charge (one-time): $3M; capacity expansion charge (one-time): $915K; and wastewater treatment charges (recurring): $11K per month X 111 = $1.221M</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: All actions shall be awarded under the same authority of this Justification and Approval is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302(a)(3). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. These actions are for acquiring utility services and construction and OCWS is the only source available to provide the service and construct the utility system.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY): The Board of County Commissioners of Okaloosa County, Florida is charged with the responsibility of collecting and disposing of domestic wastewater from OCWS customers in order to abate the pollution of Choctawhatchee Bay, Garniers Bayou, Cinco Bayou, Dons Bayou, Chula Vista Bayou, and other streams, and this abatement of pollution is necessary and essential to protect the health of the citizens of Okaloosa County, Florida. The board officially finds that OCWS will serve areas within the present county district limits. To adequately serve its customers, OCWS completed construction of the state-of-the-art APWRF in November 2009. The APWRF provides new and improved technology, has the capacity to serve a larger service area, provides enhanced operational performance, and will remove the former Garnier's wastewater treatment plant from the ever increasing residential congestion at its former location. The APWRF was constructed at the existing Garniers spray field property located on Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) property that is leased from the Air Force for this use. Currently, the 7th Special Forces Group (7 SFG) is moving from Ft. Bragg, NC to Eglin AFB. The Government has spent over $400M to construct facilities and infrastructure to enable beddown of the 7 SFG on the Eglin reservation. Instead of constructing an on-site wastewater treatment plant or contracting with another wastewater treatment entity, the AF found the only feasible alternative was to send its wastewater to the APWRF. OCWS installed a wastewater collection line from the 7th SFG compound to the APWRF, with construction substantially completed in February 2011. A modification to the 7 SFG WW connections was funded by the AF to upsize the line from the 7 SFG to APWRF to accept the additional flow planned from Duke Field, Camp Rudder, and Eglin Main. The 7th SFG wastewater collection line runs from the 7th SFG complex in a generally southern direction to the APWRF. Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder are within relatively close proximity to the 7th SFG wastewater collection line. OCWS will use the 7th SFG wastewater collection line as a trunk line. The Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder wastewater can be piped to the existing trunk line and then flow to the APWRF. Except for the APWRF, there are no other known wastewater treatment plants within the region that can accommodate the Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder wastewater flows.</p>
<p>In fact, OCWS specifically planned the treatment capacity of the APWRF to accommodate Eglin AFB wastewater flow-rates. The existing plant at Duke field has several issues: 1) the plant is in dire need of major repairs already programmed at over $850K, 2) the plant is located between the operational runway and the new simulated carrier deck used for F-35 training; this location will be in an extremely loud area and between two very active runways creating a potentially unsafe working environment, 3) Duke Field is expected to gain additional new missions which will further strain the capacity of the system. The Main Base plant is the ONLY plant which services the East side of Eglin. It was originally built in the 1960's, is approaching the end of its useful life, and has had serious issues with corrosion. Loss of this plant for any period of time will dramatically affect the mission as people will need to be sent home. The AFMC/A7 Installation evaluation team report from 2008 identified numerous concerns with plant (corrosion, capacity, lack of back-up). One of the Plew plants is in bad shape from corrosion and on either plant safety actions have to be taken to work at them due to corrosion on the walkways. The plants date from the early 1970's and have reached the end of their useful life. There has been a $10M MILCON project to replace the plants since the early 1990's as well as a minimum of $730K in repairs which are currently unfunded.</p>
<p>Eglin AFB currently holds multiple wastewater treatment plant permits from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The services described in Section II above need to be completed as soon as possible so the Air Force can avoid potential non-compliance with the wastewater treatment plant permits. With the age of the plants and their deteriorating condition, the possibilities of a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the State increases annually. The Government has determined, through knowledge of regional wastewater plants, that there are no other reasonable potential sources for this requirement. OCWS does not have a GSA Areawide contract as described in FAR Part 41.204 GSA Areawide Contracts. The Government intends to award a new separate contract as described in FAR Part 41.205 Separate Contracts.</p>
<p>Accordingly, OCWS is the only firm capable of providing the services described in Section II above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays and cost in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: <br />A special notice, Number FA2823-11-2011, was published on Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) 2 August 2011 announcing the intention of the activity to solicit and award a sole source firm fixed price utility contract to OCWS under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(3). The synopsis included a statement that the government would consider all responses. No responses have been received and no other interested parties have been identified to date.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE <br />The price will be determined to be fair and reasonable by use of cost and price analysis, the OCWS fees which are codified in the Okaloosa County Code of Ordinances, Chapter 24, Appendix A User Charge Tables for Okaloosa County Water and Sewer User Charge Ordinance, and the appropriate Government personnel will also perform a technical evaluation on the effort.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Market research was conducted by contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding market capabilities to meet requirements. The Government also reviewed the results of the similar requirement for a source of wastewater treatment for the 7th SFG where OCWS was found to be the only reasonable source. Based on this market research, the Government has determined its wastewater collection and treatment needs in this requirement can only be provided by OCWS.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: The APWRF is physically located on Eglin AFB property owned by the Government. The land is leased by the Air Force to OCWS through Land Lease L07-0277-WS30-13 (AFMC-EG-1-06-001). There are no other wastewater treatment plants located on Eglin AFB property with which the Government could award a contract for wastewater collection and treatment services. A modification to the 7 SFG WW connections was funded by the AF to upsize the line from the 7 SFG to APWRF to accept the additional flow planned from Duke Field, Camp Rudder, and Eglin Main.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: See Section VI above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: Utility collection/treatment and distribution services are inherently more efficient when provided by one source. For example, it makes more sense to only have one electrical distribution system delivering power to the customers in an area -- a second set of electrical conductors, power poles, and transformers would be a duplicative effort for the same result. The same parallel thinking can be applied to wastewater collection and treatment. Sending the 7th SFG wastewater to the OCWS plant but sending wastewater from the nearby Duke Field, Eglin Main Base, and Camp Rudder systems to another wastewater treatment plant would not be a feasible option. The inherent nature of a utility collection/treatment and distribution systems does not foster competition. The Government is not aware of any reasonable actions that could be taken to foster competition or remove the inherent barriers to competition that are found in the wastewater collection and treatment industry.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION: As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>

<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Red Cloud, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately&nbsp;3766 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of&nbsp;3275 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to a maximum of&nbsp;3340 ANSI/BOMA OASF. The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 7/1/2012.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 28 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 3 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice P12PS50583Architectural and Engineering services for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract for various projects at Acadia National Park and St. Croix Island International Historic Site
Amendment 0001
Questions and Answers, Nos. 1 through 14.
1.	Question:  The NAICS code is coded under the Landscape Architecture NAICS but the description says Architecture and Engineering.  Would a firm that is eligible under the A&E NAICS codes (541330 or 541310) be allowed to prime this contract?  Is the contract intended to be mostly Landscape Architecture projects?
Answer:  See FAR 19.301-1(a) "To be eligible for award as a small business, an Offeror must represent in good faith that it is a small business at the time of its written representation.  An Offeror may represent that it is a small business concern in connection with a specific solicitation if it meets the definition of a small business concern applicable to the solicitation and has not been determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to be other than a small business."  See also FAR 19.301-2(c) "A contractor must re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of its re-representation that corresponds to the NAICS code that was initially assigned to the contract."  This is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract; a wide range of services is anticipated, with the majority related to Landscape Architectural Services.
2.	Question:  Has this work previously been held by another vendor?  If so, who held this contract?
Answer:  The current contractor is Roc Caivano Architects of 38 Rodick Street, Bar Harbor, Maine.  Please note this firm has requested that NO firms attempt to contact them.  
3.	Question:  We are located in Norfolk, VA which is a distance away.  In regards to this distance, are you considering vendors this far away?
Answer:  It is a firm's individual business decision to submit a proposal for this announcement.  All firms must demonstrate that they can qualify based on the selection criteria in the announcement.
4.	Question:  We are open to the option of sub consulting to other firms who may bid as the primary on this job.  Can you tell me who they are?
Answer:  Please go to the "Interested Vendors List" at www.fedbizopps.gov to seek potential networking opportunities.
5.	Question:  Where will questions and answers from other potential vendors be listed?
Answer:  Amendments will be posted with questions and answers.
6.	Question:  My understanding is that new federal rules are in process that will redefine small business at $19M, and that project officers are allowed at their discretion to use the higher limit now.  Assuming the rule change is finalized in early 2012, would our company's proposal be considered for this RFQ?  Under what circumstances would our proposal NOT be considered?
Answer:  The Small Business Administration has confirmed as of this date that the limit for annual revenues of the prime firm averaged over the past three years shall not exceed $7 million for NAICS 541320.  The National Park Service will not accept proposals from firms not able to meet the size standard by date proposals are due, January 19, 2012. 
7.	Question:  In reference to the solicitation there is a Total Small Business Set Aside requirement of $7 million.  Does this apply only to the prime firm or does each sub consultant also have to fall below that small business size standard?
Answer:  The size standard is only applicable to the prime contractor.
8.	Question:  The solicitation asks for "one original and three copies" of the submission package.  By "original" do you mean an unbound copy that can be used for additional reproduction?
Answer:  No.  One original means that one set of the SF330's must have original signatures in the applicable signature block(s).  Instructions are obtainable on line via a google search for SF330's, please follow the instructions carefully.  
9.	Question:  Do sub consultants need to be registered with the CCR by time of contract award?
Answer:  No. 
10.	Question:  Is there a preference for double or single sided pages?
Answer:  There is no preference.  Pursuant to the announcement, "double sided pages will be counted as two pages."
11.	Question:  Is $7 million the top limit of revenues to be considered as a small business?  If the prime is a small business and the sub contractors are large businesses is that a disqualification factor?
Answer:     The size standard of $7 million, represents the firms average annual revenues over the past three years.  FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitation in Subcontracting, is applicable to this announcement and states in part, "(1) Contracts that have been set aside or reserved for small business concerns(c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for-(1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.
12.	Question:  Please clarify "writing and editing" in Required Disciplines and Services item A.  Is this technical, planning related, interpretive, for public affairs, any or all of these?
Answer:  The writing and editing will primarily be technical and planning.  Examples include but are not limited to: feasibility reports, development plans and studies, process summaries, compliance documents such as environmental assessments, etc.  It is not anticipated that writing and editing would include interpretation or public affairs.
13.	Question:  Maine licensing:  Required? Of whom? Will registration with NCARB, CLARB, and similar credentialing bodies satisfy the requirement?
Answer:  State of Maine licensing is required of architects and/or engineers as prescribed pursuant to FAR 52.236-25, Requirements for Registration of Designers, "Architects or engineers registered to practice in the particular professional field involved in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States shall prepare or review and approve the design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work."  Registration alone, that does not include a State of Maine license, with NCARB, CLARB, etc. will not suffice. 
14.	Question:  Is the submission address able to receive signature required, express mail from USPS, FedEx and UPS?
Answer:  Yes.

<DESC>RFI: SECHQ1-12-RFI-0001 AMENDMENT 0001
<p>The purpose of this Amendment is to 1) Provide the Government's responses to questions received for RFI SECHQ1-12-RFI-0001 and 2) Extend the closing date of RFI SECHQ1-12-RFI-0001, to January 17, 2012, 2:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>
<p><br />I. The Government's responses are provided to the following questions:</p>
<p><br />Question 1. Is there a contractor currently providing the same or similar services, or would this be considered a new requirement (in the event that a <br />solicitation is released in the future, of course)? If there is an incumbent <br />Contractor, could you please provide the contractor name and contract number?</p>
<p>Response to Question 1: Currently, pursuant to the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding, Interactive Data Pricing and Reference Data, Inc. provides services to compile and deliver to the Commission each quarter a list of "section 13(f) securities" as defined in rule 13f-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p><br />Question 2: When would the SEC want this list management to be operational?</p>
<p>Response to Question 2: This RFI is used solely for Market Research and Acquisition planning to determine if there are potential vendors who are capable of performing the required services. Therefore, the operational date has yet to be determined. Any future solicitation will specify the operational date."</p>
<p>Question 3: If we can't supply the CUSIP due to contractual terms, would ticker and BBGID suffice?</p>
<p>Response to Question 3: Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange of 1934 specifies that relevant CUSIP numbers shall be among the information that is to be included on reports filed with the Commission under this section. Relevant CUSIP numbers also are required pursuant to current Form 13F as adopted by the Commission. Accordingly, ticker and BBGID will not suffice.</p>
<p>II. The closing date of the RFI is extended to January 17, 2012, 2:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>
<p><br />//////////////////////////////////////NOTHING FOLLOWS/////////////////////////////////////////</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Dothan, AL, that will be expiring.</p>
<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding a minimum/maximum of 13,033 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet along with 83 surface parking spaces.</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is for&nbsp;two years, two years firm. The space must be available for occupancy immediately. The delineated area is:</p>
<p>North: Montgomery Hwy / US Hwy 231 North<br />South: Main St / US Hwy 84<br />East: From Montgomery Hwy, continue S on N Oates St, from N Oates St turning E on Powell St, from Powell St turning S on Appletree St, from Appletree St to Main St / US Hwy 84<br />West: John D Odom Rd</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include the following features:</p>
<p>- The location should not be located in the immediate vicinity of railroad tracks.<br />- Ease of access to and availability of public transportation and parking for visitors and employees.<br />- Space must have potential for an efficient layout. Ideal space would be contiguous and on one level. Space must have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. Columns must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than 2 feet square.<br />- Space should be located in a professional office setting.</p>
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the lease. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain. Subleases are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>W. Justin Kidwell, Lease Contracting Officer<br />General Services Administration<br />77 Forsyth St, SW, Ste 500<br />Atlanta, GA 30303-3458<br />404-562-5033<br />justin.kidwell@gsa.gov</p>
<p>Expressions of interest should be submitted to the above address by 5:00 PM EDT on January 23, 2011 and must include the following information:</p>
<p>- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />- Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />- ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />- Date of space availability.<br />- Building ownership information.<br />- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking, if any.<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />- List of building services provided.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>Xerox Audio Visual was the original vendor for this system. To maintain the integrity of the system and to insure the system will function properly after the replacement parts are in place, Xerox Audio Visual is the sole source for the replacement parts. If someone else comes in and installes the TV and Camera then to program they tried to program it, it would no work. This goes beyond plug and play.

This modification is for Logistics Support services for PMA-234 (EA-6B)program. The EA-6B has been designated as the sole DoD escort Jamming aircraft and is a High Demand Low Density platform. A sole source modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.

This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for Period of not to exceed six months begining on 1 January 2012. This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option were not exercised before the current contract expiration date of 30 June 2012. <br />This notice is not a request for proposals. No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email, U.S. mail, or facsimile to the attention of May Dimitrov may.dimitrov@navy.mil using the contact information provided in this synopsis.<br />
