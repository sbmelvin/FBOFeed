<SOLNBR>06WRSS0013
<RESPDATE>062806
<ARCHDATE>06132007
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Geology Discipline, Earthquake Hazards Program (USGS) has a requirement for a software developer or development company to develop/refine a comprehensive physics-based earthquake model in modern object-oriented computer code along with relevant manuals in collaboration with USGS scientists. This will be a negotiated acquisition in accordance with (IAW) the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.  Full and open competition will be provided for.  This acquisition is set aside for participation by small business concerns, under NAICS code 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services, for which the associated size standard is $23.0 million in average (last three years) annual revenue.  The USGS desires a contract with one base period consisting of approximately four months, with two option periods, each consisting of approximately six months.  Each period will represent the next stage of design or development.  Presently, funding is available only for the base period. A brief description of the required services follows. The contractor will be responsible for completing development of Finite Element Method (FEM) computer code that calculates (1) the amount of slip on one or more faults from stress-induced forces-and other factors such as friction, roughness, and curvature; (2) the immediate changes in stress and displacement; (3) the seismic waves that are produced; and (4) the evolution of stress and displacement over time caused by viscoelasticity and plasticity.  When needed, the contractor will utilize modeling techniques from compatible scientific and engineering fields, and adapt them for use in earthquake computations. The contractor will be responsible for extending the computer code to create and test a comprehensive 3D model of the Hayward fault system.  This element requires direct interaction with USGS scientists in Menlo Park, CA who will guide development of the model and supply the necessary 3D data sets.  Accordingly, regular visits to the USGS campus in Menlo Park, CA will be required.   The contractor will be responsible for preparing the code for publication, including writing appropriate documentation.  The contractor will present oral updates on modeling progress to staff scientists as requested. The contractor will be responsible for creating software interfaces that enable USGS earthquake scientists to adapt and extend the code to meet their future research needs. >From time to time, as need arises to accomplish USGS scientific goals, the contractor will provide modules for special short-term research projects related to earthquake modeling which can be considered natural extensions of the contractor's work on the Comprehensive Earthquake Model.  The contractor will develop and implement the necessary software, and provide model results and images for these projects.  The extended program and its documentation shall address all requirements set forth in Items 1 and 2 below. 1.  STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Computational Domain - The existing program has been designed so that computation takes place in 3D "coordinate space".  In particular, a non-linear transformation maps the coordinate space into the "physical space" where the earth resides.  Because the transformation is nonlinear, the coordinate space is a non-Euclidean space; specifically a Riemannian manifold with a curved metric.  In the performance of this task, any upgrades that the contractor performs on the core program shall conform to this 3D computational system. FEM Formulation - The existing program has been designed so that the finite element method (FEM) is carried out in the computational domain.  Because the domain is a curved manifold, it is necessary to use a tensorized version of FEM, where all physical equations are expressed in tensors in a form appropriate for curved space.  All volume and surface integrals must be performed using curved-space formulations involving the metric and Levi-Civita tensors.  In the performance of this task, any upgrades that the contractor performs on the core program shall conform the the FEM formulation design as described below. The existing program generates a mesh surrounding a specified fault system.  Cell boundaries are positioned to coincide with the fault surfaces, and the mesh includes special nodes that represent slip along the fault surfaces.  Extensions to the mesh design must be able to read in topographic and bathymetric data, as well as data specifying a 3D warped fault surface, and distort the mesh accordingly. New FEM code shall be constructed in object-oriented form, and needs to be sufficiently general to handle any arbitrary cell shape, needing only a suitable description of the desired shape.  For example, it needs to be able to support cell shapes such as hexahedra, tetrahedra, triangular prisms, and quadrilateral pyramids; as well as handle both linear and quadratic cells. The existing program includes a linear solver able to handle very large problems and able to solve sparse linear systems of several million equations on a desktop PC in a few minutes.  The solver is able to impose constraints, for example, constraining the motion of certain nodes to lie in a fault surface.  The linear solver shall be extended to solve non-linear problems through the use of tangent stiffness matrices.  These additional constraint support capabilities need to be intrinsic to the solver (for example, not rely on the addition of fictional "springs").  The extended capabilities shall preserve the ability to modify constraints "on-the-fly" without recomputing the coefficient matrix. Validations Tools - As a validation tool, the contractor shall extend the program to incorporate an analytic dislocation solver, which will be used in simple cases to provide analytic solutions for comparison to the FEM solutions.  The analytic solver must be able to implement a solution similar to the well-known Okada formulas, except modified and extended so that the fault slip is given by an FEM shape function.  The contractor shall develop an additional validation tool, a built-in patch-test module, in order to test various cells and combinations of cells to ensure they behave correctly. Geophysical Effects - The existing program supports both flat-earth and curved-earth computations.  Its geodetic model takes into account:  the oblateness of the earth; centrifugal forces due to earth's rotation; and the variation of gravitational acceleration with depth.  In the performance of this task, the contractor shall develop 3D model capabilities that account for gravitational body forces and for the effects of friction, roughness, and curvature on the fault surface by calculating normal and tangential forces at each node, and by constraining the motions of nodes on the fault to produce the correct total seismic moment tensor at each node. The contractor shall test the capability of the Comprehensive Earthquake Model to specify the rheological properties of the crust, and allow them to vary arbitrarily with location by importing rheology properties for linear and non-linear elastic, viscoelastic, and plastic materials from existing 3D data sets based in the EarthVision geologic software package. 2.  PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS The specified extensions, revisions, and upgrades to the Comprehensive Earthquake Model computer program will be written in C++, and will be designed to ensure portability.  There are several dimensions to portability: Code Portability - The contractor shall ensure that new code will adhere to the ISO C++ standard, and not use functionality specific to any one operating system.  The extended program will avoid arcane or obscure code constructions (whose support might vary amount different compilers) and programming practices that are known to introduce portability issues.  Where system dependency is unavoidable (e.g., file naming conventions), such code will be isolated in one place for easy modification.  At a minimum, the code will be compiled and tested on both Windows and Linux systems. Data Portability - The contractor shall maintain strict control of I/O on a byte level (so that data files are byte-for-byte identical) to ensure data-file portability on different systems.  Where the code must read files prepared by other programs (i.e., text files created by a text editor), the extended code will be flexible enough to accept a variety of different formats, and such code will be isolated in one place so additional formats can be added easily. Command Portability - For any new script files (used to issue complicated series of commands), the contractor shall avoid the problem of non-portable files by utilizing the previously defined script language, which includes expression evaluation, conditional execution, loops, and user-defined procedures, and built-in code to read and execute the script. Time Portability - In order to provide a complete software product that will execute on future computer systems, running operating systems that are yet to be developed, the contractor shall not rely on any facility that has a significant risk of becoming unavailable in the foreseeable future. Scientific Portability - The contractor shall ensure program portability to a variety of seismotectonic settings, as well as provide documentation to ensure access to scientists with more modest computer skills. Self-diagnostics - The completed program will have built-in diagnostics to run tests of the various program modules and verify that they are operating correctly. DELIVERABLES The contractor will prepare the software identified above for publication so that scientists both inside and outside the USGS can use it.  In addition to public release of the core FEM program, the contractor will provide the documentation, test model, and interface functionality described below.  These products are to be provided in digital report format, via e-mail or anonymous ftp data transfers. Documentation - The contractor shall deliver User Manuals that describe how to operate the program, how to write scripts, how to generate meshes, how to run FEM calculations, and how to export results for visualization. Hayward Fault Model - The contractor shall construct a detailed model of the Hayward fault, using the latest data available from USGS scientists.  The model will test and demonstrate the ability of the program to perform leading-edge research.  Implementation of the Hayward fault model will help identify any additional functionality that may be needed, and any changes that may be needed to ease creation of additional models.  The Hayward fault model will also serve as a large, detailed example to assist scientists in their use of the program.  Note that full development and testing of this model will require funds beyond the current level. Modified Program Code - The entire program will be upgraded with changes and extensions resulting from development of the Hayward fault model as described above. The following deliverables are conditioned on the availability of funds: Documentation - The contractor shall deliver Theory Manuals that describe how the program works internally, how the tensorized FEM is formulated, and how the coordinate transformations are achieved, including appropriate equations. Documentation - The contractor shall deliver Programming Manuals that describe the software architecture, how users can extend the program with their own code, how to add new capabilities, and what programming interfaces are available. Application Programming Interfaces - Because research is inherently unpredictable, it is important that scientists be able to extend and modify the program by adding their own code.  The contractor shall create defined interfaces within the program where scientists can add code safely, without disrupting the operation of the program or needing to understand every detail of program operation.  These interfaces will include extending the script language by adding additional commands, defining new types of material constitutive properties, defining new types of FEM cells, defining new fault behavior models, and defining new geodetic models. Additional Research Modules - As needed, the contractor shall develop and implement additional research modules that perform new functions.  These modules may include a New Madrid stress field model and a rate-and-state constitutive model. Complete specifications will be provided with the Request for Proposals, which is anticipated for release on or about 29 June 2006. For further information regarding this announcement, please contact Jeff Caravelli, Contracting Officer, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.  Numbered note 1 applies.

<DESC>(LPR Retrofit - Program Management – SME)

Through a combined effort, initiated in 1998, with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), Perceptics Division was able to refine and deliver a production model License Plate Reader (LPR) system that automatically locates, reads, processes and communicates license plate data to the Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS).  NGIT currently owns all data rights to the software, specific hardware, processes, methods and algorithms that were used to produce this system.

To preclude system obsolescence, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to negotiate a contract on a non-competitive basis with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), Perceptics Division, 9737 Cogdill Road, Knoxville, TN for: (1) Program Management/Logistical Services; (2) The purchase, installation and acceptance testing of customized License Plate Reader (LPR) partial system replacement/retrofit kits to include: Network Video Processors (NVP), Cameras, Sensors and/or Strobes, only when required on initial non-compatible pilot sites; and (3) the services of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to assist with the integration of current CBP Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) capabilities for one (1) year.  The retrofit kits will provide NGIT developed replacement computer part assemblies/associated software for components that have become obsolete and are no longer being manufactured.  These efforts will not only ensure continued operation of the LPR systems originally acquired from NGIT, but will also provide a test bed to verify compatibility with other existing systems/equipment.  These interim actions will bridge a gap in timing for negotiation of a future system-wide contract. CBP intends to purchase retrofit parts as needed base on system failure rates.  NGIT is the only provider capable of providing this equipment/software and expertise due to CBP’s LPR equipment compatibility with other systems presently installed at Ports of Entry (POE) and connectivity with a CBP database.  It has been determined by CBP that no other firm is capable of meeting this immediate requirement.

Title:    Development of Evaluation Manuals to Build the Capacity of CBOs to Submit Evaluation Indicators and Data to CDC	



NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source contract with MACRO International, 11785 Beltsville Dr., Calverton, MD 20705.    The Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) is a national-level strategy that provides high quality training and technical assistance in diffusing science-based HIV behavioral interventions to state and community HIV programs.  The CDC, with its partners, provide training and technical assistance on twelve interventions identified in CDC’s Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness.  These interventions have been proven effective through research studies that showed positive behavioral (e.g., use of condoms; reduction in number of partners) and/or health (e.g., reduction in the number of new STD infections) outcomes.

The Contractor, as an independent agent and not as an agent of the government, shall furnish all personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies and materials necessary to expeditiously complete the DEBI Specific Implementation Manuals, and to develop a TOT Evaluation Technical Assistance Curriculum.  (The evaluation training itself, associated costs, supplies, materials and activities related to implementing the training are not part of this contract but subsumed under another contract). To achieve this purpose, this request for proposals will be used to increase the capacity of CBAs who in turn will provide training and technical assistance to health departments and CBOs) to develop their capacity to evaluate EBIs and to collect and report process and outcome monitoring and program performance indicators. The Contractor will accomplish this through the use of training of trainers (TOT) approach for CBAs.  Organizations eligible to receive the TOTs through this contract are selected CBAs funded to work in Focus Area 2 by the Capacity Building Branch, Division of HIV Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Monthly Reports:

In addition to the reports called for in the statement of work, the Contractor shall submit to the CDC Technical Monitor and the Contracting Officer monthly reports of performance under this contract.  Monthly reports shall begin 15 days after the end of month one and due on the 15th of each month.  The purpose of these reports is to keep appropriate Government managers apprised of the current status of significant work activities under this task.  When information has been previously reported to CDC in such formats as site visit reports or written minutes of meetings with CDC staff, it need only be referenced in monthly reports.  These reports shall include as appropriate:  a description of all activities, problems encountered and procedures used to solve them, stakeholder participation and issues, communications with persons, groups, organizations, and agencies and the nature of those communications, activities scheduled for the next month, and key personnel changes.

Bi-Monthly Conference Calls

The contractor shall participate in bi-monthly conference calls with the CDC Technical Monitor, assigned behavioral scientists and trainers and others, as deemed necessary. The purpose of these calls shall be to discuss the tasks; activities; problems encountered and procedures used to solve them; stakeholder participation and issues; communications with persons, groups, organizations, and agencies and the nature of those activities scheduled for the next month; personnel changes; copies of any documents and reports.  The Contractor shall submit a one-page summary of each conference call to the Project Officer and Technical Monitor.

Final Project Report

Within 2 weeks of the end of the project the Contractor shall submit a draft report to the technical monitor (outlined in Task 13) summarizing the project and its findings in narrative and figurative format. The Technical Monitor/Project Officer will respond with comments on the draft final report within ten (10) working days of its receipt.

The Capacity Building Branch (CBB) at CDC has been charged with the task of moving science into the field in order to more effectively address the HIV/AIDS crisis among vulnerable groups in the United States. To accomplish this task, CBB is managing and implementing the Diffusion of Effective Interventions Project (DEBI) and the evaluation manuals are needed to provide training of trainers, (capacity building providers) who will in turn train and provide technical assistance to community-based organizations. The staff at ORC/MACRO are experienced and trained on both DEBIs and PEMS and are uniquely qualified to develop the previously described materials because they have the knowledge, and have developed expertise on implementing evaluation guidance and protocols for the first 12 DEBI evaluation manuals. 
  
CDC will be providing DEBI evaluation implementation manuals to community-based organizations (CBOs) for the six DEBIs that CDC presently disseminates, and, six new DEBI implementation Manuals using the same format and similar protocols.  These services are available from ORC/Macro, which CDC has worked with extensively to develop the first six implementation manuals.  To move these to a new contractor will severely delay the process for the following five reasons because another contractor will have to: (1) be trained on the interventions and the program evaluation monitoring system (PEMS); (2) thoroughly review the boxed versions of the interventions used for training in order to understand the theoretical framework and logic models; (3) develop TOT materials that reflect an understanding of the required changes; (4) make those changes, and (5) respond to additional changes, if any, required by the Associate Director of Science.  CBOs are already in their second year of a five-year funding cycle and need help to implement their interventions as soon as possible.


The Statutory Authorities permitting other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.  Inquires must be received by June 20, 2006, at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Jerry Outley at jmo4@cdc.gov.   Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Jerry W. Outley, Contract Specialist.

<CONTACT>Tim Eckert, 202-385-8454
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Air Traffic Organization, System Operations Programs is conducting a Market Survey / Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace, obtain information on available technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission need, gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices, and determine the possibility of a 8(a) or small business set-aside. This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey / Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey / Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Failure to respond to this market survey will not result in exclusion from any future competition. Attachment A is a draft of general characteristics of the Enhanced Status Information System (ESIS) system requirements.  Attachment B are the market survey submittal requirements.  Interested vendors are requested to provide full and complete responses to the submittal requirements listed in Attachment B. Special emphasis is being placed on vendors with experience in supplying computer generated display equipment. Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Respondents to the Market Survey /Request For Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support an acquisition strategy for the ESIS. At this time, the nature of this competition has not been determined. In accordance with paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 of the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), this market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition would exist if this acquisition were set aside for eligible small businesses or for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program.  The North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is projected to be 334310 (Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing) with a size standard of 750 employees.  Interested firms are requested to submit the attached Business Declaration form (Attachment C) and a copy of the 8(a)certification (if applicable).  Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified 8(a) firms and small businesses to respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  The FAA anticipates having a contract for this requirement awarded by February 28, 2007.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source modification to AT&T Corp., 2020 K Street, Washington, DC 20006.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of work performed under contract DCA200-97-D-0048 that was competitively awarded to AT&T on 28 January 1997.  The contract is currently due to expire on 27 July 2006.   The proposed modification provides a 3-month extension of services, plus one 3-month option period.  The contract provides common-user dedicated transmission service within the Continental United States (CONUS), between various DOD base/post/camps via the DS/BMS - C bandwidth managers and SONET backbone.  Some transmission services are used to provide connectivity for DOD dedicated networks, e.g., JWICS, SIPRNET, NIPRNET, and DSN.  Transmission services include providing the transport of voice, data, video, imagery and other information between Government specified Bandwidth Manager points; and providing SONET-based capabilities between DISN Bandwidth Managers and providing access transport from specified service delivery points (SDPs) to DISN Bandwidth Managers.  Required transmission services include, but are not limited to:  T1, T3, OC3, OC12, and OC48.  This proposed contract action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow rapid extension to deployed military forces anywhere in the world.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  The services under this contract are currently being transitioned to the DTS-C Access Optimization (A/O) contract.  It is estimated 1,000 circuits and 100 backbone and bridge trunks will not be cutover by the end of July due to delays in getting the infrastructure in place. The DTS-C A/O contract is a bridge contract to provide continued support until the services can be moved to the follow-on competed replacement DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract.  The anticipated award date for the DATS contract is fourth quarter FY2006.  AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a sole source acquisition to conduct research and technology studies to reduce volumes in High Level Waste (HLW) glass compositions for the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The chromium leach factor is known to have a significant impact on estimated HLW glass volume created during the waste treatment process.  Heretofore, oxidation practices have been limited to the use of a single oxidant, such as permanganate.  The proposed contract will provide application of proprietary technology for the application of multiple oxidants to expedite chromium oxidation and potentially increase the amount of chromium removed. Based on patent considerations JEH Consulting, Inc. supported by Tulane University is the only one responsible source that will satisfy the agencyâ€™s requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for services intended to support the implementation of a unique data processing capability in support of NSWC Carderock’s core capability of acoustic signature assessment of full-scale submarines. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to ARION SYSTEMS INCORPORATED (ASI). The services involve techniques for which ASI has initiated the patenting process.  A Provisional Patent has been issued with Serial Number US60/682,426 and entitled Recursively Field-Optimized Compensation Using Spherical Decomposition.  By the nature of the patenting process, the nature of the techniques is proprietary.  This is a follow-on effort designed specifically to support existing data analysis and prepare the algorithm for actual acoustic trial support. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 6/28/2006.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to issue a request for proposal for a single source to integrate and provide a stationary, direct pressure blast cleaning cabinet, with manually controlled devices for the removal of paint from metallic components by projecting abrasive media fluidized with compressed air through a nozzle. The glovebox abrasive blast unit shall be designed to comply with the following facility interface requirements: Overall dimensions: approximately 72 inches (width) x 72.25 inches (length) x 91.25 inches (height); Power requirements: 460V, 3 phase, 60 Hz; Compressed Air Requirements: minimum of 125 CFM at 60 psi; Space requirements: at installation site, clearance from the front will be required for operator access and operation. Right side clearance is necessary for access for swing doors and for cartridge inspection. Minimum of 18 inches of rear clearance is required for access to piping manifold, exhauster, and screen hopper; Other requirements: All wiring and electrical controls shall be installed with all connections completed within and on the unit, so that upon installation of the unit, all that is required is connection to the pneumatic supply and electric power source. Installation instructions shall be provided with the units. The glovebox abrasive blast units provided shall be optimized for use with 60 grit aluminum oxide blast media. This media is available in 50 lb. bags. Ten bags of media or equivalent shall be supplied with the glovbox abrasive blast unit. Delivery, installation, start-up, testing, and training will be located at IMF, Silverdale, WA. This RFP will be issued as a 100% small business set-aside competitive procurement. The equipment shall be designed for simplicity of operation and safety to operating personnel and shall permit easy accessibility of components for normal maintenance and servicing. The unit shall consist of three sections, including the blast cabinet, media supply system, and recovery system. The unit shall be designed for use with steel abrasive media, as opposed to other blast material. All efforts shall be made to ensure maximum corrosion resistance in the construction of the unit (both interior and exterior surfaces), including but not limited to the prohibition on the use of dissimilar metals and complete priming and surface preparation of bare metal components prior to construction. Interior surfaces shall be designed for maximum corrosion resistance and ease of clean up. Sealed bearings shall be used whenever possible to preclude the need for frequent lubrication and to prevent dust intrusion. A stiffener bar shall be included in the cabinet frame to eliminate media leakage from around the light. All necessary measures shall be taken upon construction to prevent dust and/or media leakage from the unit. The glovebox shall be designed to enable the operator to work through the glove ports and manually direct the abrasive blast against the work piece, while observing the blast action through the window. The window shall be a shatterproof glass or plastic assembly not less than 1/8 inch thick designed to tilt out if needed. The window shall be sealed and mounted to absorb shock and resist leakage. Outside light reflections shall be minimized. The window dimensions shall be 20 inches (height) by 30 inches (length). The glovebox shall contain a turntable that can be manually wheeled in and out of the glovebox on a dolly and track. The interior dimensions of the glovebox (+/- 2 inches) shall be 70.5 inches (deep) by 69 inches (wide) by 63 inches (high). The glovebox shall be constructed of carbon steel of no less than 12-gauge, with the glovebox floor 3/16 inches thick perforated steel having a 1,000 lb. capacity for a distributed load. The glovebox sump shall be designed to ensure a continuous gravity flow of spent plastic media and debris into the return duct without the use of mechanical vibration. The outlet for the spent media and debris shall be sufficiently large to prevent debris from obstructing the recovery system. The blast hose shall be designed to resist media abrasion and withstand working pressure. The hose shall be sufficiently flexible to withstand bending into a circle of 5.0 inches maximum radius. The nozzle and holder shall be manufactured from an erosion resistant material. The unit shall come with tungsten carbide lined nozzles of 3/8 and 5/16 inches. The inside diameter shall both be ½ inch. The hose shall be sufficiently long to enable both right and left-handed operators to perform the blasting without encountering ergonomic difficulties.  

This requirement shall be fulfilled by supplying “commercial items” as defined in Section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Interested parties will be required to submit, with their quotation, information to evaluate technical, past performance, past experience and price aspects. These four factors will be evaluated as equal in weight under a best value evaluation. The estimated issue date for the RFQ is 29 JUNE 2006. This RFQ will be posted on the NAVAIR web site at www.navair.navy.mil.

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) www.niams.nih.gov , intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the Research Foundation of the State of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3400, to provide membership support for NIAMS staff on the Advance Polymers Participating Research Team (AP-PRT) at the National Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven National Laboratory. The NIAMS has been conducting research in studying the molecular structure of the contractile proteins in muscle cells for over two decades. The primary goal is to understand the mechanism of muscle contraction and the relationship between function and structural skeletal muscle. Membership of NIAMS staff on the Advance Polymers Participating Research Team will improve understanding of the relation between structure and functions of the muscle cells, and the knowledge could be extended to understanding other motile systems in living cells. The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Advance Polymers Participating Research Team at the National Synchrotron light Source in Brookhaven National Laboratory, is the only known source which is currently conducting research using beamline x-ray sources that is required in the NIAMS experiments. An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Period of Performance: The proposed period of performance for this service is to begin on September 1, 2006 thru August 31, 2007. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition requirements are not applicable to this acquisition.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Under authority granted in FAR 13.501, the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to seek a quotation on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS from Dr. Lorenz Rhomberg to produce a manuscript and conduct follow-on tasks from a previous project report Dr. Rhomberg produced under a preceeding order entitled "Toxicokinetic and Toxicodynamic Issues in Conducting Cross-Species Scaling for Acute Inhalation Exposures"(Project A).  That document successfully identified and addresses options and underlying issues in acute inhalation dosimetry.  This project (Project B) is for an  analysis of the underlying basis for performing interspecies inhalation dosimetry between acute and chronic inhalation scenarios. This project is to focus and address the following issues in a manner that may provide options for their further characterization or possible resolution. - review and  analysis of information available describing (or simulation thereof) cross species scaling relationships, ideally between experimental laboratory animals and man, and temporal aspects of internal dose (e.g., information demonstrating relative times to steady-state in lab animals and man for a range  of toxicants contrasted by their kinetic behavior)    - use of actual or simulated information that would be accompanied by internal-dose scenarios that could describe or explain the duration- response relationships of various toxicodynamic processes occurring as a result of  acute exposures.   Candidate toxicodynamic processes include but are not limited to those identified in Project A including nerve transmission, metabolic disruptiojn and inflammatory processes.  The aspects of  effective doses described in this analysis may include those identified and discussed in Project A  including critical concentration (Ccrit), time above a critical concentration (tau), area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration, and parent or metabolite (preferably slowly cleared).       Dr. Lorenz Rhomberg possesses qualifications that are considered both unique and essential for successful  completion of this project.  Dr. Rhomberg has established himself as an authority in the intellectual area related to this discrete and insular project.  No other contractor has or can obtain these capabilities as Dr. Rhomberg possesses intrinsic intellectual ownership of the concepts and the  interpretative capacity of the concepts underlying this project, these concepts being intrinsic to his personal knowledge and intellect. Dr. Rhomberg is the only known individual with the knowledge and experience required to successfully perform this project. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A  REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by June 28, 2006 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed  contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to  Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to solicit proposals on a competitive basis for research and development of Quality Metrics for Friction Ridge Impression Examinations. The FBI anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee contract. The FBI Laboratory performs latent print examinations and renders opinions as to the individualization of subjects for law enforcement purposes.  Accordingly there must be sufficient scientific basis established to support these opinions.  While sufficient basis has been established over the last 100 years, there have been advances in technology that may provide new or improved techniques to test this basis and better formalize the process involved. Human latent print impressions can be deposited on crime scene evidence by any portion of friction ridge skin.  These areas include the entire palmar surface of the hands and soles of the feet.  Friction ridged skin areas are generally referred to as fingerprints, palm prints, and foot prints. Friction ridge impression examinations involve both a quality and quantity assessment.  In order to better manage these two components in a research effort the FBI is separating the two issues at first to establish metrics that can be applied to each.  The RFP will be limited to just the quality aspect. It is envisioned that that this project will contain two separate, yet complimentary parts.  The first will involve consensus from latent print examiners to describe the metrics and features utilized by practitioners to assess latent print quality. This information shall be used as input for the development of an automated system, which should objectively measure features and yield a quality metric(s). Quality assessments of latent and know exemplar prints must be addressed in both analysis and comparison phases of the ACE-V process.  IT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS RFP TO DEVELOP ALGORITHMS FOR AFIS TECHNOLOGY. No paper copies of the RFP will be provided nor is a mailing list being maintained for this acquisition as the RFP will be posted electronically to the Federal Business Opportunities website on or before June 28, 2006. All responsible sources may submit a proposal; however only proposals received within 45 days of the date of this publication will be considered. Questions or correspondence should be directed to Ms. Lynda M. Theisen, Contracting Officer, via email lmtheisen@fbiacademy.edu or via fax (703) 632-6427. All correspondence shall reference 06-0141182.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Radiation Research Society, 810 E 10th St., Lawrence, KS  66047 to publish a 194 page special supplement to Radiation Research (the official publication of the society).  This supplement is  monograph describing radiation dosimetry methods applied to epidemiological studies previously, or now being conducted within REB.  The goals of the dosimetry monograph are to introduce readers to an array of dosimetric methods and applications that have been developed to reconstruct radiation exposures for epidemiologic studies. REB intends to fill a void in the technical literature by describing these methods in terms understandable to epidemiologists, dosimetrists and statisticians, so that these research tools can be used by other members of the research community.  The objectives of the monograph are to:  1) Describe dosimetry methods that have been developed to reconstruct 	radiation exposures for epidemiologic studies conducted by the REB; 2) Make research methods available for use by the research community; and 3)  Promote dosimetry work used by REB.  Radiation Research publishes articles directed toward the research community and to readers who would have an interest in the dosimetry topics outlined in the planned monograph. Radiation Research is a unique journal in the field of radiation science, because it targets researchers who would be interested in both epidemiology and dosimetry. By publishing these papers as a "special" supplement, Radiation Research will distribute the publication to its approximately 1,800 subscribers.

<DESC><B>VENDOR:  <U>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice only.</U></B>
<P>
This is a <U>NOTICE OF INTENT</U> to negotiate on a sole source basis.  SSA intends to negotiate with Opnet Technologies, Inc. of 7255 Woodmont Ave., Bethesda, MD 20814-7900 for the following Opnet branded software:  
<P>
-PDM - Planning & Design module; perpetual rights<P>
-PDM-SY - Planning & Design Module upgrade subscription; 1 year<P>
-PDM-SY - Planning and Design Module technical support agreement; 1 year<P>
-WM - Wireless Module; perpetual rights<P>
-WM-UY - Wireless Module upgrade subscription; 1 year<P>
-WM-SY - Wireless Module technical support agreement<P>
<P>
This will be conducted under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) in which only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The place of performance is Social Security Administration, 6201 Security Blvd, National Computer Center, Baltimore, MD 21235-2000. The period of performance is 12 months from date of acceptance by the government. Opnet Technologies, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing the requested software.
<P>
The Planning and Design Module and the Wireless Module will allow vastly increased modeling forecast capabilities for SSA via DOCPM’s “IT Guru” software.  More extensive and more accurate Wide Area network (WAN) traffic models can be developed quickly while preserving methods consistent with OTSO’s philosophy of leveraging resources already available to the organization, IT Guru software and personnel experienced with this software. As a bonus, these modules will provide flexibility and compatibility for modeling to incorporate potential future sources of data. Without these modules, SSA will not be able to accurately customize network traffic projections for each of its 1600 remote offices in a timely manner and must rely on time consuming manual data collection methods through large databases of historical network. Without each module, SSA does not have adequate staffing levels to perform database collection and analysis within an adequate turnaround timeframe. There is insufficient staffing to perform these tasks manually and SSA would have to rely on reactionary needs rather than extensive modeling these modules permit. Over provisioning is expensive, while selective ad hoc reviews can miss potential capacity shortfalls.  There is no systematic or proactive methodology presently in use at the agency to insure correct network capacity at every remote office.
<P>
As stated above, this is a <U>NOTICE OF INTENT</U>, not a solicitation.  When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to Opnet Technologies, Inc. IT Guru software products.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.     
<P>
In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) memorandum dated April 17, 2006 regarding the publication of Brand Name Justifications, the solicitation, to be issued to Opnet Technologies, Inc. only, along with the corresponding justification is being published and will be available via FedBizOpps on or about June 14th, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled hardware design and schematic entry and consulting expertise, solicitation No. NNG06155542L which was posted on May 31, 2006. You are notified that the purpose of this modification is to address questions and answers. 1) It is not clear what work would be directed solely to Dynamics Sensing Technologies and what work, if any would potentially be a consulting contract to a different vendor. Could you please provide some clarification in this regard?      Answer:  The work synopsized will be directed completely to Dynamic Sensing Technology. 2)  Are you looking for a consultant to develop the entire design?      Answer:  No.  The consultant will collaborate with NASA development team in the overall system design.	This collaborative effort will require the consultant to have expertise in both the fundamental engineering design principles involved in designing, testing and fabricating the system as well as the science application that the system will be used in order to achieve science objectives.  Dynamic Sensing Technologies has prior experience in both areas, and are the only small business that meets that requirement based on the market search. 3)  Do you want the consultant to build the hardware prototype?      Answer:  Yes 4)  Do they have to only design by writing Code (C, C++, Java, etc.) or use a Graphical user interface (GUI) based software and hand this over?         Answer:  No.  The system to be designed consists of high-speed printed circuit board (PCB), several Field Programmable Gate Array's (FPGA's) and several other electronic components that cannot be designed by writing source code or software. 5)  Has the hardware specification for the rest of the system been assessed?       Answer:  The hardware specifications for the system are currently under assessment  6)  Has the specification for hardware processor and data acquisition system already written so the consultant can evaluate it?  If so, in what format?       Answer:  No.  The hardware requirements for the processor are currently under development. 7)  Is the system going to have a single or multi-core processor and are these processors custom or standard core?       Answer:  The system will consist of FPGA's and not microprocessors.  As a result, the processor(s) for this system are entirely custom. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). [INSERT ANY APPLICABLE NOTES]

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF ROLL CONTROL THRUSTER AND VALVE PACKAGE FOR NASA'S CREW LAUNCH VEHICLE, which was posted on May 23, 2006. You are notified that the following changes are made:  NASA is seeking procurement of two advanced development thrusters as part of the CLV Upper Stage Program.   This action is part of multiple advanced development acquisitions that are required prior to the Upper Stage Production Contract being awarded.  Ultimately, the Upper Stage Production contractor will be responsible for the manufacture and integration of the Upper Stage and these components.  Further CLV US planning information is available at	   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/eps_data/119491-OTHER-001-001.pdf      .  The intent is to pursue a thruster design maturation approach  to reduce potential development schedule risk associated with uncertainties in the guidance navigation and control requirements of the Constellation Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV).  Each thruster design will be capable of meeting the baseline CLV requirements for the roll control function during First Stage operation. The first thruster option will be an 800 pound vacuum thrust-class, at vacuum, bi-propellant design that utilizes hypergolic monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants. A thrust range of +/- 100 lb is acceptable for the 800 lb vacuum thrust-class bipropellant thruster. The second thruster option will be a 400 pound vacuum thrust-class, at vacuum, monopropellant design that will utilize hydrazine propellant. A thrust range of +/- 50 lb is acceptable for the 400 lb thrust-class monopropellant thruster.  Both design options will be capable of pulse, off-pulsing, and steady state operation from sea level to 180,000 feet altitude over the 132 second First Stage operational period.    The procurement will consist of a base period and options.  The government will reserve the right to make single or multiple awards. In the event a single award is made: During the base period, the 800 pound-thrust class bi-propellant thruster and/or the 400 pound-thrust class monopropellant thruster will be designed and matured to a level capable of supporting the CLV Upper Stage vehicle development schedule.  During the base period, a valve package capable of supporting both monpropellant and bipropellant design approaches will be designed, developed and tested. Two options will be included.  The first option will be for the development and testing of a flight-like and flight-weight development-level 400lb thruster and valve package that will meet the CLV vehicle requirements and objectives.  The second option will be for the development and testing of a flight-like and flight-weight development-level 800lb thruster and valve package that will meet the CLV vehicle requirements and objectives.    The decision on which, if any option will be exercised will be made once the program requirements are clarified.  Testing at the thruster and valve levels consists of representative operating conditions to validate the design to enable proceeding into formal qualification and production in a follow-on effort. In the event a multiple award: During the base period, either the 800 pound-thrust class bi-propellant thruster or the 400 pound-thrust class monopropellant  thruster will be designed and matured to a level capable of supporting the CLV Upper Stage vehicle development schedule.  During the base period, a valve package capable of supporting either or both monpropellant and bipropellant design approaches will be designed, developed and tested.  The contract will include an option for the development and testing of a flight-like and flight-weight development-level thruster and valve package that will meet the CLV vehicle requirements and objectives (either 400lb or 800lb).  The decision on which, if any option will be exercised will be made once the program requirements are clarified. Testing at the thruster and valve levels consists of representative operating conditions to validate the design to enable proceeding into formal qualification and production in a follow-on effort. In order to meet CLV program critical milestones, completion of the proposed base period development effort is anticipated to be completed within 11 months from ATP with the selected option to be completed 13 months after completion of the base period. Responses identifying the offeror's experience and capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirements outlined above should be a specific as practicable.  Electronic submission is preferred. The due date for responses is hereby extended through June 27, 2006.  Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with the National Governors Association, Center for Best Practices, 444 North Capitol Street, Suite 267, Washington, DC 20001, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The cost reimbursement contract will be awarded for a base year with two 12-month option years.  The Contractor shall develop and establish a consensus-based executive-level advisory body where states will be able to: identify, assess and through the formation of consensus solutions, map ways to resolve state-level health information technology (health IT) issues that affect multiple states and pose challenges to interoperable electronic health information exchange; provide a forum in which states may collaborate so as to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the health IT initiatives that they develop.

The Government is seeking to establish a sustainable consensus-building body that must cross political affiliations to address issues, form consensus solutions and implement plans at a state level.  As such, the contractor that establishes this body must be a politically neutral entity that has the expertise, audience acceptance, experience and ability to respond to the Office of the National Coordinator’s (ONC) need to identify, assess and broker consensus solutions to resolve state level health information technology (health IT) issues that affect multiple states and pose challenges to interoperable electronic health information exchange.  The contractor needs to be a not for profit 501(c)(3) entity.  Furthermore, the contractor needs to work with state level entities that have sufficient authority and breadth of duties as to be able to consider and implement a variety of policy solutions that could come in the form of regulations, reimbursement policies, financing models, coverage, and technology.  ONC believes that Governors meet these authority and breadth of duty concepts.  Taking all of this into account, ONC believes that the National Governors Association (NGA), Center for Best Practices is the only known organization in the United States that has the requisite experience, state audience acceptance and successful operational platform to work directly with state governors to successfully broker significant multi-state consensus building activities that lead to workable solutions.  The NGA is the collective voice of the Nation’s Governors.  The association provides governors and their senior staff members with services including developing policy reports on innovative state programs and hosting networking seminars for state government executive branch officials.  The NGA’s Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and best practices on issues that range from education and health to technology, welfare reform and the environment.

Title:  Adolescents in Multiple Service Systems and Their Transition to Adulthood 

Issue Background: The transition to adulthood, often defined as the period from ages 18 through 24, continues to be a time of development.  During this time frame, young people face a multitude of challenges, including making choices about education or employment, leaving the parental home, establishing relationships with peers, making independent decisions and learning to accept responsibility for one’s actions. Researchers have estimated that between 5 and 7% of youth will not make a successful transition to independent adulthood by age 25. 

Adolescents with mental health issues are more likely than those in the general population to have difficulty transitioning to adulthood.  According to a report released by the Surgeon General, approximately one in ten children experience mental health problems that interfere with normal development and functioning each year.  There is a higher prevalence of mental health issues for youth in the juvenile justice, child welfare, and runaway and homeless systems than for youth in the general population. 

Adolescents who have not transitioned successfully tend to have grown up in poverty and to have limited family support systems.  Some also experience interruption or termination of many supportive services at age 18 when most youth age out of various service systems.  Aging out of youth-oriented care is a significant obstacle for these young adults because they may lose access to health care, mental health services, housing, and protective services such as runaway and homeless shelters for youth.  

Researchers tend to focus on a single vulnerable population, rather than study youth who overlap multiple systems.  Yet, involvement with one service system is often associated with an increased risk for involvement with another system. For example, a growing body of research indicates that childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for a range of negative outcomes, including mental health symptoms and disorders, delinquency, and academic failure. Abuse and neglect during childhood are risk factors for homelessness:  across samples, between 50% and 75% of homeless youth have been physically abused, sexually abused, or both.  Another study of homeless youth found that living on the street puts youth at greater risk for sexual or physical victimization as well as involvement in the juvenile or criminal justice systems.
 
Project Background:  This project will use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the trajectories of adolescents with mental health needs as they transition to adulthood, paying particular attention to adolescents who have had contact with multiple service systems, including mental health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and runaway and homeless programs.  Because of the longitudinal design and the scope of the survey, the Add Health data set provides a unique opportunity to identify a recent cohort of youth who have needs addressed by various service systems and to follow them as they transition and enter adulthood.  Policymakers and program administrators often lack information about how best to serve adolescents with mental health issues, especially those who are involved with more than one youth-oriented system.  Analysis of this data will inform decisions surrounding the coordination of child and family service systems.

Add Health is a longitudinal nationally representative study that explores the causes of health-related behaviors of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 and their outcomes in young adulthood.  Add Health seeks to examine how social contexts influence adolescents' health and risk behaviors.  Data from students, parents, school administrators, and others were collected in three waves. The first 2 waves of data were collected between 1994 and 1996. These Waves look at influences (e.g. family, relationships, schools, and personal traits) on adolescent behavior. Add Health respondents were re-interviewed in a third wave when they were between 18 and 26 years old to look at the influence that their adolescence had on young adulthood. More detailed information about Add Health is available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth

A possible task order will be used to perform a secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). As part of the analysis, substantial effort and consideration will be spent on identifying and characterizing the youth of interest as described; Specifically, how well do the data capture adolescents in multiple social service systems and what variables will be used to identify them for the analyses?  The analysis will require firms to use multiple waves of data in order to analyze the domains of interest cross-sectionally as well as identifying changes over time.  Through this analysis, ASPE hopes to gather insights into the trajectories of adolescents with mental health needs as they transition to adulthood.
This task order requires firms to have contractual agreements in place and access to the restricted-use Add Health data files at the time of award. To address the research questions, only firms with demonstrated experience using multivariate analysis and familiarity with Add Health data will be considered for award.  
 
ASPE is seeking statements of corporate capabilities with respect to this procurement.  Interested firms are encouraged to:
•	Describe the firm’s experience in research on topics related to adolescents with mental health issues with a specific emphasis on those pertaining to the areas of foster care, juvenile justice and runaway and homeless youths;
•	Demonstrate corporate experience conducting longitudinal analyses using the Add Health dataset (public-use or restricted-use);
•	Demonstrate corporate expertise with using multivariate analysis and growth curve analysis;
•	Demonstrate understanding of how Add Health has been used previously to explore developmental trajectories and adult outcomes;
•	Identify personnel with knowledge of key federal programmatic and policy issues related to mental health, foster care, juvenile justice, and runaway and homeless adolescents;
•	Identify the staff person who would likely be proposed as the project director for a task order on this topic; and
•	Provide documentation of access to the restricted-use ADD Health data.
•	Describe the firm’s capability and experience using longitudinal data sets that examine child well-being outcomes (e.g. NSCAW, NLSY).



The purpose of this is to determine whether there are sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 3:00 pm EST, June 23, 2006.

Title:

Child Welfare Privatization Initiatives:  Assessing Their Implications for the Child Welfare Field and for Federal Child Welfare Programs

Purpose

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) will have a requirement to develop written materials about state and local child welfare privatization initiatives, drawing from existing research findings and the experiences of state and local program administrators.  This project will (1) identify key issues and challenges surrounding the privatization of a child welfare services system; (2) develop issue papers intended to assist state and local child welfare agencies considering privatization initiatives as well as support those officials already moving forward with privatization efforts but facing challenges; and (3) develop options for future research that will better inform future child welfare privatization efforts. The contractor will gather and synthesize information on existing privatization models and research findings in the child welfare field, as well as lessons offered by privatization efforts in other social services arenas, in order to produce a series of papers on key topics. One paper would concentrate on research gaps and identify potential opportunities to address them. Others would lay out key choices and decision points in shifting from a public to a private system, and the implications and effects on clients as well as on both public and private agency roles and operations. Implications for federal child welfare programs will also be explored.

This project will involve approximately one person-year of labor, across labor categories, spread over approximately 18 months.

Background

Public child welfare agencies have long histories of working with private partners to provide services.  Such efforts have expanded in the past decade or so as child welfare programs have adapted ideas and technologies from other fields including health and welfare programs.  Several states have created large-scale system reform initiatives that have replaced public child welfare services with contracted services from private providers. A great deal has been written about particular initiatives, especially state-level efforts in Kansas and Florida.  However, there are limited resources available to program administrators and policy makers about the key decision points and options that must be considered when designing or expanding child welfare privatization initiatives.

For the purposes of this project, ASPE is most interested in learning from initiatives in which key, core functions and decision making authority for child welfare cases are delegated to private agencies that operate on behalf of the state or county child welfare agency.  We are less interested in more traditional outsourcing arrangements in which private service providers perform specific, limited roles, although aspects of such efforts may inform some of the documents developed through this contract.

As part of the effort to learn more about the privatization of child welfare services, in 2005 the Children’s Bureau within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) awarded a cooperative agreement to the University of Kentucky to establish a Quality Improvement Center (QIC) on the Privatization of Child Welfare Services. ASPE’s project is intended to complement the current and future activities of the QIC and is being developed in consultation with ACF staff.  The intent of this project is to focus on several activities that are not central to the QIC’s current operations, but that will facilitate the QIC’s ability to inform the field regarding the possibilities and challenges of privatization initiatives.  More information about the activities of the QIC is available at its web site:  http://www.uky.edu/SocialWork/qicpcw/.  

Qualifications Sought

ASPE is seeking statements of corporate interest and capabilities with respect to this project.  Interested firms are encouraged to describe their: 

•	Thorough understanding of child welfare services and programs, with particular emphasis on the varied roles of private providers in public child welfare systems and how privatization initiatives may fit within child welfare agencies’ reform agendas.
•	Knowledge of the existing literature and research underway regarding the privatization of child welfare and related social services.
•	Experience designing research and evaluation of systemic reform initiatives in the social services, preferably in the child welfare field, and in considering research design alternatives for such initiatives.
•	Demonstrated skill drawing out themes and lessons pertinent to social services program administrators from diverse information sources, including direct contacts with program staff at the state and local levels.  Experience with the child welfare system specifically is preferred.
•	Experience synthesizing research findings, as well as lessons learned from less formally studied program implementation experiences, for audiences of policy makers and social services program managers.  
•	Demonstrated ability to produce user-friendly written materials for policy makers and social services program managers, preferably specific to the child welfare field.
•	Offerors are encouraged to identify key staff available for this effort.


The purpose of this is to determine whether there are sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 3:00 pm EST, June 23, 2006.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide computer software services over a five year period to support the Common Working File (CWF) system, to include maintenance, developmental enhancements, and special projects as required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The CWF system is a major component of the Medicare claims processing function within CMS to provide a single data source where Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs), carriers and Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERCs) verify beneficiary eligibility and receive prepayment review and approval of claims. Medicare currently serves over 40 million beneficiaries and processes more than 1 billion claims per year. The CWF is made up of over 1.5 million lines of program code based on traditional CICS online and COBOL and COBOL II, using a VSAM data structure. The CWF is controlled by the following components: Controller/router (prioritize actions and route claims), Accept/reject process, Administrative edits, Part A consistency edits, Part B consistency edits, Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetic, Orthotic, and Supplies (DMEPOS) consistency edits, Duplicate edits, A/B Crossover alerts, A/B Crossover edits, Entitlement edits, Part A utilization edits, Part B utilization edits, DMEPOS utilization edits, Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) consistency edits, MSP utilization edits (secondary payer claims), Coordination of Benefits (COB), monitoring of Veterans Administration (VA) claims, Out-of-service area claims process, beneficiary updates, unsolicited responses and claim related functions. CWF also contains the following sub-systems: Part A Eligibility and query support, Part B Eligibility and query support, Health Insurance Master Record (HIMR), Reports, Purge, History Conversions, Internal Test Facility, and Cross Reference/Merge process.

The CWF software is a Medicare Part A/Part B benefit coordination and pre-payment claims validation system. The CWF software uses localized databases maintained by designated contractors called Hosts. There are currently nine virtual and two physical CWF Hosts that maintain a distributed database of beneficiary master records. Each beneficiary master record resides at its assigned Host’s database only.  FIs, carriers, and DMERCs are referred to as satellites and each one is associated with one or more CWF Hosts. Currently there are more than 100 satellites. 

The computer software services required by the contract include CWF maintenance of over 1.5 million lines of code, developmental enhancements to the CWF, and special projects as approved by CMS. The contract will include the following scope of services: 

(1) update and maintain the CWF software to include, but not limited to, CMS mandated changes or corrections for program code as well as user-related changes and enhancements, data dictionary maintenance (mainframe and web based), JCL and PROC development, and database maintenance; 

(2) provide comprehensive testing of all changes before distributing each software release (includes unit, system and regression testing, as well as supplying baseline test data with each release to be used at the Hosts and Single Testing Contractor [STC] to ensure the release has been installed properly); 

(3) provide quarterly standardized, fully tested computer software releases and up-to-date documentation (mainframe and web based), as well as special and emergency releases to the CWF Hosts; 

(4) provide computer software maintenance service activities to CWF Hosts including 24/7 production support for customer service to each of the CWF Hosts (9 Hosts run the CWF software for more than 100 satellites processing Part A and B claims);

(5) provide computer software maintenance service activities to the STC;

(6) maintain HETS (HIPAA Eligibility Transaction System), a system that is processing 270/271 eligibility transactions on a 3-tier architecture in a real-time environment, X12N transactions sent via the Medicare Data Communications Network (MDCN). The logical architecture is organized into three layers that consist of the User Interface Layer, Business Logic Layer and the Data Access Layer. The system consists of contractor developed J2EE software interfacing with Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products.

(7) maintain adequate security as well as comply with federal statutes and regulations as identified in the CMS Business Partners Systems Security Manual.

This is a highly simplified illustration and does not address the more complicated aspects of the process, nor does this simplified illustration address the CWF updates to the CMS central office systems such as: the CWF Medicare Quality Assurance (MQA) system, the National Claims History (NCH) system, and the Enrollment Database (EDB) system, the Renal Beneficiary Utilization System (REBUS) the interface to the Beneficiary Operational Data Store (BODS) that supports the HIPAA 270/271 and internet DDE transactions, and Report on Medicare as Secondary Payer System (REMAS). 

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. 

The minimum contractor requirements are: 

(1) written proof of a CMMI Level II Certification that can reasonably be applied to the organizational and/or functional group being proposed; said certification must be no more than three years old at the time of contract award, and must have been performed by and signed by a suitable independent entity having no corporate affiliation with the business or with any parent, division, subsidiary, joint venture, partner, affiliate, or other corporate entity connected to or with the business or which holds a financial interest in the business or in which the business holds a financial interest; the appraisal must have been conducted or led by an SEI-licensed and -authorized Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) Lead Appraiser. Within 18 months of the contract award, the specific organizational and/or functional unit performing the work under the contract must be re-certified by a suitable independent entity which meets these same requirements and has been approved in advance in writing by CMS. In all cases, the business must provide the name, address, telephone number, employer, and training of the individual(s) who performed and signed the certification; the decision by CMS as to the suitability of the certifying entity and/or applicability of the certification shall be final.

(2) similar experience with maintaining a complex computer system with at least one million lines of code; parties should describe their experience and indicate the number of lines of code maintained.

(3) similar experience with writing requirements, designing, coding, testing, and implementing changes to a system amounting to approximately 40,000 direct hours annually. Parties should describe their experience or demonstrate their ability to provide the hours, the nature of the system, and the changes performed.

(4) extensive knowledge of the Medicare program (i.e., Parts A and B claims processing, CWF, shared system maintainers, etc.) and the complexities associated with its frequently changing nature (i.e., the CMS change management process). In addition, knowledge of the Medicare systems that interfaces with CWF (i.e., Medicare Quality Assurance (MQA), the National Claims History (NCH) system, and the systems identified above.

(5) experience with the following:

<DESC>Description

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is requesting information to determine the availability of interested parties to provide and operate an MRI and multimodality imaging facility for small rodent species in support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).

The Offeror shall provide support to:
1.  Operate a Government-furnished 7 Tesla MRI system which consists of a 210 mm bore Magnex Scientific superconducting magnet with shielded gradients, a GE Medical Systems EXCITE console, and RF subsystems specific for imaging small laboratory rodent species. 

2. Maintain and extend the capability of this system as required by the NIEHS for extended capabilities such as increased spatial resolution, specific tissue contrast, and high specimen throughput.

3.  Perform MR imaging of rodent tissue specimens at a spatial resolution that is more than 300,000X greater than that routinely used on clinical imaging systems. The field of view for imaging may be directed at observations of the whole animal (e.g. mouse embryos or fetuses) and specific functional systems and /or organs (e.g. mouse brains, heart, lungs). This will entail; a.) The use of specialized tissue preparation methods for specimen fixation (use of alternate contrast agents, perfusion fixation), b.) Manufacture of specialized radiofrequency coils, and c.) Integration of unique image acquisition strategies and novel reconstruction methods to allow rapid acquisition (acquisition times of < 3 hrs) of very large high-quality image arrays (> 4 GB/image) with isotropic 3D spatial resolution < 25 microns. Tissue specimens shall be prepared in a manner that would permit subsequent evaluation of tissues by conventional histology following imaging.  Additional modalities for imaging small laboratory rodents such as micro-CT, ultra sound, molecular imaging and other specialized optical modalities may be required. The Contractor shall develop and operate such systems as appropriate for small animal (rodent) imaging in support of NIEHS studies.

4.  Perform longitudinal (in vivo) imaging studies in which the same animal(s) is/are imaged at multiple times to observe the time course and response (temporal pathogenesis and/or recovery) and pathology (development of anatomic features such as tumor growth) associated with exposure to xenobiotics.  Such studies shall require the use of specialized equipment and procedures for animal support structures and anesthesia to minimize motion, careful control of body temperature, and radiofrequency coils adapted to the very high magnetic field environment. 

5.  Provide and/or use a government furnished web-accessible digital electronic system for managing the access, review, downloading, and the archive of digital image data files and collateral documents pertaining to scientific imaging studies. The system must have the capacity to handle an exceptionally broad range of digitized imagery including conventional histology, very large 3D image arrays generated in MR histology, microCT, microPET, power point presentations, scanned images and other imagery, data, and collateral documentation. This scientific imaging management system must include the capability of enabling any user at NIEHS to access the images, data sets, and collateral documents from multiple sites with commonly used personal computers and modes of Internet access. 

6.  Provide expertise/advice concerning rodent magnetic resonance image acquisition strategy, MRI image quality, and its biological and/or scientific significance.  Participate in interpretation of the generated images and/or provide training in sample preparation and/or image interpretation for NIEHS investigators.

7.  The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following: 1) The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov; 2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association For Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA “Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” (CFR 21 Part 85).

MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS: The following mandatory qualification criteria must be met at the time of award:  1) the contractor shall provide an imaging facility, equipment except for magnet and APPROPRIATE staff dedicated exclusively to support of NIEHS/NTP studies; 2) the facility shall be located within a 30 to 45 minute driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709; 3) the facility shall be accessible to NIEHS/NTP scientists; 4) all components of the Imaging Facility and the support areas including offices, and laboratories and a facility for temporary housing of small laboratory rodents in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (PL89-544) shall be located on one site.m

For estimating purposes the Government estimates the level-of effort at 15760 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional – 4920 direct labor hours; Technical - 9840 direct labor hours; Administrative Support - 1000 direct labor hours.

INTERESTED OFFERORS SHOULD SUBMIT (5) COPIES OF THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTEEN (15) PAGES IN LENGTH, EXCLUDING STANDARD BROCHURES, ETC., FOR RECEIPT BY THE AGENCY ON June 27, 2006.  Please submit information to Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, P.O. Box 12874, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709. Courier address: Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, 79 TW Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Commons, Suite 100, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709 Inquiries will be accepted by fax (301) 451-5597 or e-mail barbourp@niehs.nih.gov

<SUBJECT>B -- Russia/CDC Reproductive Health and Tuberculosis Elimination in High Risk Population Projects
<DESC>In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302(1), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source, cost-plus-fixed fee, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity contract to the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF) in Washington, D.C.  The contractor shall provide expertise, supplies and materials, and logistic support for reproductive health, unintended pregnancy prevention, and tuberculosis (TB) elimination projects in Russia which are broad and focus on strengthening research, policy, program, training, and public health infrastructure. CRDF is a unique public-private partnership created to facilitate scientific and technological cooperation between the United States and the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  It is a private, non-profit, charitable organization authorized by Congress and established by the National Science Foundation in 1995 as an American response to the declining state of science and engineering in the independent states of the FSU.  The CRDF seeks to address this issue by fostering opportunities for collaborative projects between FSU and US researchers.  CRDF is the only qualified organization that has experience and demonstrated success performing this type of requirement in Russia based on the following: International non-governmental organizations (NGO) must apply to the Ministry of the Interior in Russia in order to be federally approved under Russian law, to work in Russia as partner contracting agencies for work in Russia. CRDF is the only approved contractor that has the capabilities to perform this requirement; and their previous successes working with the only NGO in Russia (SANAM), regional health departments, federal Russian scientific institutes, and in partnerships with local, regional and federal Ministry of Health officials. Because of the broad and integrated reproductive health and STI/HIV/TB activities to prevent adverse outcomes of high risk sexual and substance-use behaviors and TB transmission, it is essential that contractual support have 5 or more years’ experience in integrated implementation of research, programmatic, training, and policy development activities in the areas of both reproductive health and unintended pregnancy/STI/HIV/TB prevention in targeted cities and regions of the Russian Federation; CRDF has such experience. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the service described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the service.  Please send your documentation to Zalerie Moore at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or by e-mail to fkw7@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY High-Speed Imaging
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
High-Speed Imaging


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize LLNL’s invention with applications to High-Speed Imaging. 

Background: Whether it be biological, chemical or physical, high-speed imaging provides a glimpse into fast and ultra-fast phenomena. High-speed imaging is filled with creative solutions to capturing ultra-short events with high spatial resolution, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The most common methods involve rotating mirrors or drums usually made of beryllium that become severely stressed by centripetal forces causing failures to occur. Even if the exploding mirror can be contained, beryllium dust is known to cause dangerous diseases when inhaled. Rotating mirror cameras are not only potentially dangerous, they are expensive to purchase and operate, and have severe limitations in both temporal and spatial resolution.

Electronic methods used to capture multiple images suffer from low resolution and/or low number of frames due to sharing the limited space of a semiconductor chip. One major disadvantage to using the Shaw Camera or Image Conversion Camera for image capture is the requirement for one electronic gate (proxifier or microchannel plate) and one detector array per frame. The cost is further increased by the high voltage pulser required for each frame.

Multiplexed holography has also been employed for the capture of a series of brief exposures. However, holography requires a special laser which has a single wavelength (typically a cavity seeded single longitudinal mode) and a single transverse mode (TEM00).

What is needed is a better method and apparatus to make high-speed imaging systems more accessible to scientists, engineers and the general public through a system that is lower in cost, safer to operate, covers a longer event window (more frames), and has higher dynamic range and higher spatial and temporal resolution. A system that does not require a complex and expensive laser to operate as well as a system that can use light with bandwidth (a range of wavelengths) to avoid graininess (caused by speckle); and could record and play back the images in color would be desired advancements.

Description:  LLNL’s high-speed imaging invention refers to a method by which you can store a tremendous amount of information in an extremely short period of time.  The information is input into the device as a time varying array of pixels (each of which can record red, green and blue intensity values).  Each array can be composed of millions of pixels. 

 
Advantages:   In addition to applications for storage of large bursts of data, this technology could be used to capture a series of images (perhaps a thousand) in a very short time (perhaps one hundred microseconds) wherein each frame is a snapshot of a high-speed event (exposure of 100 nanoseconds or less). The period between the acquisition of each image can be as short as 100 nanoseconds which corresponds to a ten million frame per second rate of capture.  

Key features of this technology include:
Variable frame rate above and below 10Mfps; continuous access system; ability to optically gate a stream of images with a light source and/or shutters; system can capture 900 or more frames in sequence; each image frame can have over 3 million pixels; high dynamic range; white light, full color image recording is possible, with or without lasers; several views are possible and can be captured in parallel (for stereo pairs) or in series (to increase the total number of frames into the thousands); and the system is portable.

Potential Applications:  High-speed imaging has many industrial applications including the study of fast moving objects where motion blur prevents one from acquiring detailed images. Explosives, ballistics, chemical reactions and the “instant replay” in sports use high-speed imaging to determine what is happening by recording and replaying the action back in slow motion. 

There are numerous applications in diagnosing fast moving machinery or assembly line products, physics modeling of shock waves, determining fracture dynamics, understanding interactions between lasers and materials, recording the motion and performance of space re-entry vehicles, documenting automobile crash test results, even improving the execution of a golf swing.

Such a capability would be useful for explosive event tests, shockwave modeling, inferring equation of state values from resultant velocimetry data, fracture dynamics, shaped charge jet formation, and ballistics.

Development Status:  LLNL is in the process of filing a patent application for this technology.  While some technical risk remains, LLNL is moving forward with proof-of-principle experiments.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's High-Speed Imaging technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
