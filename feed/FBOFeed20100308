<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Integrated Command &amp; Control</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 10-01-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Meeting the demands of assigned missions requires unprecedented amount of coordination and synchronization of military resources across all organizations and all echelons of command in all levels of war. It is command and control (C2) that provides the means by which a commander synchronizes and/or integrates force activities in order to achieve the commonly recognized objectives in one unity of effort. These activities require key decisions within the strategy, planning, scheduling and assessment phases of the command and control process. These decisions are made by humans and are supported by computer technology so it is in these areas that information technology contributes the most to ameliorating human capabilities and transforming how the Air Force commands and controls. <br /><br />The goal of the Integrated C2 program is to lead the discovery, development and integration of revolutionary warfighting information technologies that enable continuous and distributed, planning, execution, and assessment of resources across the cyber, air and space domains to achieve commander's intent. Air Force Research Laboratory is seeking innovative white papers to address the following thrusts:<br /><br />&bull; Strategy Development. The functional translation of a commander's conceptual vision and guidance into potential solutions via an adaptive planning capability that supports the generation of a plan of action and seeks to answer the questions of what is to be done and how. By monitoring the plan and operating environment, adapt to evolving situations and represent the necessary actions which incorporate all means available across each of the warfighting domains of the Air Force (air, space and cyber). A key challenge is to understand the complex relationships and dependencies that exist across these domains. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: machine reasoning with uncertain, erroneous, and incomplete information; dynamic causal modeling and multi-criteria analysis summarization; computational efficient mixed initiative planning that balances cognitive and machine load; incorporation of analogical/experiential reasoning (fusion of distributed experiences, capturing knowledge &amp; experience of the past, determining relevancy of past situations); and asynchronous planning on plan fragments versus synchronous "lock and work" planning over multiple iterations.<br /><br />&bull; Synchronized/Integrated Planning. Produce a logistically feasible plan of action to solve the problem, fully integrating subordinate action plans with a description of the role of the other elements of national power in conjunction with military activities. Synchronized/integrated planning includes requests for actions and describes the role of military activities in achieving the desired effects. The integrated "battle" plan enables warfighters to coordinate and synchronize all available forces, kinetic and non-kinetic, to achieve the desired outcomes and exploit opportunities as they present themselves. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: a living plan with "on the fly" action plan/course of action adaptation/mutation that addresses changing conditions of the operational environment; identification, correlation, and advisement on mitigation of external events affecting the processes and mission; continuous adaptive planning; and comprehensive mission-driven situation awareness sharing.<br /><br />&bull; Continuous Assessment. Full spectrum analysis of the attainment of mission objectives at all levels of the campaign (tactical to strategic). At the plan's inception, conduct rigorous examinations of the alternatives and the desired and undesired consequences of each action leading to valuable insight into the actions, causal mechanisms, and effects that support the accomplishment of the objective. Leading indicators or clues can be explicitly identified with their timing which then can be used as a measure of progress towards accomplishing the desired objectives providing the means by which each player understands what is necessary to achieve the overall objectives and the ramifications of their individual actions. Such insights serve to highlight key challenges in sustaining a campaign's progress and are important for synchronizing the force. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: non-deterministic, non-linear causal analysis with reasoning through uncertainty and ambiguity; projective/forward looking analysis through modeling and simulation; use of belief networks within a decision-making environment and how beliefs influence a decision/assessment; dynamic assessment of a-priori and a-posteriori achievement of commander's intent; deliberate causal analysis that identifies key missing data that can be used as information requests; and optimized presentation of complex heterogeneous data.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 1) The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates an understanding of the problem, an innovative and unique approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, its application and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly levels. 2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. 3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. 4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<DESC>In response to additional restoration funding, a follow-on habitat design plan is required for Upper Newsome Creek located on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce National Forest.  The initial design was awarded to Ecosystem Research Group, based in Missoula, MT, using competitive procedures in 2007 and completed in 2008.  Competition for the follow-on design is being limited to Ecosystem Research Group and the subcontractors and affiliates that worked on the original design.  It was determined that opening up the competition to the broader marketplace would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Forest Service that was not expected to be recovered through competition.  The contract awardee will utilize existing watershed data to design additional work elements for the restoration project.  The awardee shall then supplement and update the original design documents, specifications, maps, worklists and materials lists with the new information.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided for information purposes only.  NASA Goddard hasselected Fibertek Inc for the Laser Systems Engineering Services (LSES) contract,NNG09CP09C.  This is an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Cost-Plus Award Feecontract valued at $35 million. The period of performance is five years. The NAICS Codeis 336419 and the Size Standard is 1,000 employees.  The estimated value of the proposed task order #9 is $300,000. The anticipated period ofperformance is 1 April 2010 to 1 Sept 2010.  NASA Goddard intends to award Task Order #9 to contract NNG09CP09C, IAW the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, PL 111-5. Task order #9 is Ice, Cloud and LandElevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) Project which is baselining a multiple ground-spot,micropulse laser measurement approach for ranging to collect data on the topography ofpolar ice. NASA has placed a high importance on continuous monitoring of polar ice asthis data is necessary for ongoing global climate research.  The ICESat-2 Mission willcarry a single instrument payload, called ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser AltimeterSystem), which will use precision laser-ranging techniques to measure the topography ofice sheets and the thickness characteristics of sea ice. The ICESat-2 Project is in PhaseA formulation activities that include instrument architecture and measurement schemedefinitions. Several US laser vendors are developing laser transmitter designs andprototypes for ATLAS to meet a series of milestones established by the ATLAS laser team. The reliability of the ICESat-2/ATLAS laser transmitter is critical to the missionsuccess.  Since this task will be used in support of the selection criteria for theeventual ICESat-2 laser vendor, it must remain independent of any specific approach orvendor for the ICESat-2 laser development effort.  Work will be performed at NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Md., and at the contractor's facility.Specific needs to this task are: 1)	Determine the scope and develop a plan for assessing the reliability of the fourlaser transmitter suppliers.2)	Conduct a review of the laser transmitter design, the components used in thelaser transmitter assembly, and quality manuals, combined with a visit to each suppliersmanufacturing plant for interrogations, discussions and preliminary on-site qualityaudits.3)	Acquire and review the available test/reliability data about each lasertransmitter component intended for use in each of the four laser transmitter supplierslaser transmitters.4)	Clarify designs, data, ideas and conclusions of each of the laser transmittersuppliers.5)	Document suppliers plans to address reliability threats for the lasertransmitters.This document and any other related documents to this procurement will be available overthe Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may beaccessed using a WWW browser application.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Aeroflex Cupertino, 10411 Bubb Rd, Cupertino, CA 95014.  The BOA will cover a five year period to procure signal generator hardware, software, spares, repairs, upgrades, modifications, and technical and engineering services for the Counter-Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare devices in use at this time.  A commercial solicitation will be issued using other than full and open competition to Aeroflex Cupertino IAW FAR 6.302 and statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the system resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  The proposed BOA is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Aeroflex Cupertino, under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Aeroflex Cupertino, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government's requirements.Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed BOA based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The POC is Ms. Rhea Earle, Code CXMSVS, at telephone (812)854-8744, or email: rhea.earle@navy.mil.  NAICS Code 334220; FSC Class 58.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   Combined Synopsis / Solicitation
RFQ-DC-10-00053
*THIS RFQ CAN ALSO BE FOUND AT http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/1000053/index.htm 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI), Technology Innovation and Field Services Division (TIFSD), Analytical Services Branch (ASB) seeks to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of performing dioxin/furans and CB congeners analytical services.
A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; instead, it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the multi-media, multi-concentration dioxin/furan analytical service and the multi-media, multi-concentration chlorinated biphenyl (CB) congener analytical service is to provide analytical data for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in support of the investigation and clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of1980 (CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of1986 (SARA). Other USEPA Program Offices, as well as customers outside the Agency, that have similar analytical data needs also use this service 
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The dioxin/furan analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 17 2,3,7,8-substituted tetra through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which the Government will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds. 
The CB congener analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of chlorinated biphenyl (CB) congeners in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which USEPA will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds. 
The specific task requirements are detailed in the DLM02.2 SOW and the CBC01.2 SOW, available at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/.
The North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380 and the size standard is $12 million.
There is no monetary value to this agreement.
Interested vendors must be registered at CCR.gov and ORCA.BPN.gov (in accordance with FAR Parts 4.11 and 4.12).
REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS AND EVALUATION: All responsible sources may submit the required documents listed below, in writing, to the identified point of contact below by the response date. Documentation may be submitted electronically to the point of contact, or may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service to: U.S. EPA Ariel Rios Building, Attn: Wendy Rizzo, Mail Code 3805R, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460; or, via commercial delivery or courier service to: U.S. EPA Ronald Reagan Building, Attn: Wendy Rizzo, Mail Code 3805R, Room 61174, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20004.
The following required submissions are all due no later than 3PM Eastern, 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement. All submissions will be evaluated as PASS/FAIL. A rating of fail in one area will result in an ineligible submission.
1) Capabilities StatementA general statement that describes the laboratory's capability to analyze samples under the two statements of work, as well as an organizational chart. 
2) Verification FormThe form entitled HR-GC/MS Verification and Certification Form is linked below. This form is required for each machine that the contractor anticipates using under the agreement. Contractors verifying and certifying the possession of the appropriate equipment by the due date specified above will receive a PASS score. 
3) COI PlanThe EPA has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts of interest (COI). In order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate conflicts, the contractors are required to have a COI plan for identifying and reporting actual and potential COI. The submitted COI plan must address the EPA Minimum Standards for Contractors' COI Plans, which are posted as an attachment to this announcement. All plans that adequately address the Minimum Standards will be rated as PASS.
4) Post-Award Performance Evaluation Sample and On-Site AuditsAll contractors that receive a Basic Ordering Agreement will be required to pass a post-award performance evaluation sample, as well as an on-site audit. These two requirements must be completed and passed before the contractor is eligible for individual purchase orders. If the Contractor has satisfactorily completed both requirements under the current Blanket Purchase Agreements, the Government reserves the right to not re-perform the audit and/or performance evaluation sample. Details regarding this requirement will be given to individual laboratories after award.
QUESTIONS: All questions should be addressed to Wendy Rizzo at Rizzo.Wendy@epa.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is submitting this Request for Information (RFI) for the design and installation of an independent suspension system on the Force Protection Buffalo MRAP (Buffalo) vehicle.  A project has not been identified for execution and funding is not available for this request.  This is a RFI only.  The gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), which is the maximum allowable weight limit when fully loaded, is 76,000 pounds for the Buffalo vehicle.  Under typical operating conditions, the Buffalo gross vehicle weight is between 50,000 and 55,000 pounds.  The Buffalo is a 6x6 vehicle with a single front axle and two tandem axles in the rear.  The front axle may be subjected to static loads up to 32,000-33,000 pounds, when configured with armor.  Under typical operating conditions the load on the front axle is on the order of 25,000-27,000 pounds.  The rear tandem axles are rated for 25,000 pounds each (50,000 pounds for entire rear tandem), and under typical operating conditions the load on the rear axles will not approach the 25,000 pounds per axle rating.   The USMC is interested in potentially procuring independent suspension system kits for the MK1, MK2A1, and MK3A2 Buffalo variants.  An independent suspension system kit that is the same across all variants or at least utilizes the majority of the same parts across all variants would be preferred to reduce logistical and supply complexity.  The contractor will be required to provide the suspension system as an installation kit, complete with drawings and step-by-step instructions for installation.  Up to 83 vehicle independent suspension system kits may be required.  The independent suspension system kits will be shipped to Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany, GA for integration.  Within six (6) months of contract award, the contractor will be required to provide and install a prototype kit for testing at a government test facility for a period of approximately three (3) months.  Upon successful completion of testing, two additional kits shall be provided for validation and verification of the build structure.  Upon completion of testing, validation, and verification, the three prototype kits shall be retrofitted to the final, accepted production configuration, and the contractor shall begin full-rate production to produce the remainder of all kits within one (1) year.  The contractor should also provide cost data to install the Independent Suspension System on all Buffalo vehicles in the USMC fleet.  Most installations will be performed in the United States, and some installations may need to be performed in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, and/or Japan.  The contractor will be responsible for providing test support and installation personnel.Respondents to this RFI should provide technical information and cost data for systems and/or products that will meet the requirements stated above and information regarding the availability and cost of data rights.  Responses to the RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Maria Britton - MRAP 50 Tech Parkway, Suite 107, Stafford, VA 22556 or submitted electronically to maria.britton@usmc.mil no later than March 22, 2010.Point of Contact:  Maria Britton, Contract Specialist, maria.britton@usmc.mil; Richard Augsburger, Contracting Officer, richard.augsburger@usmc.mil

<DESC>The 22nd Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Base Pavements contract at McConnell AFB, KS. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.<br />The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned Base Pavements contract would consist of a firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity or requirements contracts to provide a vehicle for executing pavement related projects on McConnell AFB. For the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI), the anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310, with a size standard of $33,500,000. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be able to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/).
<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that one contract could be awarded for a term consisting of one base year plus two, 1-year option periods. Task Orders written against the Pavements contract are anticipated to range between $20,000 and $2,000,000. The overall program value is still under consideration; accordingly, at this point it is roughly anticipated to be in the range $7,000,000 over a three-year period.</p>

<a href="mailto:daniel.cordasco@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>This is a Market Survey to identify potential sources to deliver MEMS rate gyroscopes to replace the legacy CN-1552 and Stability Augmentation System (SAS) Amplifier spinning mass rate gyroscopes currently used in the Army Black Hawk A through L model helicopters. There are two CN-1552s and one SAS Amp rate gyro per aircraft. This is a form, fit, and function replacement and the electrical and mechanical interface must be identical to the legacy spinning mass gyros.  The rate gyroscope must give an output that is linearly proportional to applied angular rate in the sensitive axis. The SAS amp rate gyro must produce an AC output since demodulation is performed external to the rate gyro in the SAS amp. Full scale output is 5 VDC at 40 degrees per second and -5 VDC at -40 degrees per second (the CN-1552 and SAS amp rate gyro should have identical outputs after demodulation).  Key performance parameters (KPPs) include scale factor linearity and repeatability over temperature, null linearity and repeatability over temperature, RMS noise at 100 Hz sample rate, and bias stability per the Allan variance method. An emphasis is also placed on long term reliability and obsolescence mitigation. Repeatability over multiple test runs is essential. As part of RFP evaluation, a demonstration conducted at a government test lab on at least three units will be required as part of the proposal evaluation to validate KPPs and ensure that the offerer is production ready. Complete technical requirements documents (TRDs) will be presented with the request for proposal (RFP).  Draft versions of these TRDs are provided. The present TRDs may be subject to change.  The government intends to award a 5 year IDIQ contract for approximately 7500 units in FY11.<BR><BR>Sources must be able to obtain Full Airworthiness Qualification approval per Army Regulation 72-60 by the approval authority of AMCOM Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED), AMSRD-AMR-AE, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5000.  AWR requirements will be specified in the TRD.  The AWR requirements will most likely include typical environmental requirements for helicopters per MIL-STD-810G and EMI requirements per MIL-STD-461E.  Suppliers capable of producing these items as specified above must so indicate, by writing to, US Army CECOM LCMC, ATTN: RDER-PRA-AB, Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5043.  The response should include documentation substantiating that the supplier has a full understanding of the MEMS rate sensor technology and production processes necessary and is capable of providing the aforementioned items in accordance with requirements. <BR><BR>This SSA is a request for information (RFI) only and does not constitute a solicitation (RFP) or obligate the Government to award a contract. No telephone responses will be accepted, only responses in writing will be considered. This information can be emailed to the Governments points of contact as follows: Daniel Cordasco at Daniel.Cordasco@us.army.mil.  This SSA is for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals. The deadline for response to this notice is 2 April 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services with a size standard of $25 Million.

1.	Introduction

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement for engineering, architecture, operation and maintenance of existing and future video teleconference (VTC), audio conference, streaming, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), multimedia and unified communications collaboration systems and related design, architecture, infrastructure, facilities, and environment in the following supported locations:

-	The National Capital Region (NCR), which is located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and includes offices in Arlington, Falls Church, Fort Belvoir, and Dahlgren, VA
-	Schriever AFB, CO
-	Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, AL, multiple office locations within the Huntsville region
-	Kirtland AFB, NM
-	Fort Greely, AK
-	Los Angeles AFB, CA
-	Edwards AFB, CA
-	Vandenberg AFB, CA

-	Potential future sites:

- 	Other CONUS and OCONUS locations (TBD)

Subject services are currently being provided under a single MDA contract. This contract will expire in May 2011 and will be replaced with a follow-on contract.

2.	Background

The purpose of this SS/RFI is to update Market Research related to this requirement.

The MDA is the headquarters/acquisition agency tasked to develop and field a ballistic missile defense capability for the United States and the Department of Defense (DoD).  This includes management of critical assets and a missile force that is geographically separated not only within the NCR, but also throughout the United States and around the world.  This geographic dispersion is one of the greatest challenges facing the agency.

The MDA was named in the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) announcement.  Location specific information may change as the BRAC is implemented.  Current plans call for a much smaller contingent, estimated between two hundred fifty (250) and three hundred (300) personnel, to remain in the NCR at Ft. Belvoir, VA and at Fairfax, VA while the rest of the manpower and related resources relocate to Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, AL area in FY2011. Manning at other CONUS locations will remain unchanged.

Video teleconference, telepresence, audio conference, streaming, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), multimedia, unified communications, and unified collaboration are critical capabilities for the MDA that supports centralized cost-effective program executive decision analysis, performance assessment, agency collaborative management and rapid unified reporting to the President, Secretary of Defense, and Combatant Commanders.  These activities and actions relating to MDA events often require long-distance coordination and discussion in real-time.  They do not allow for periods of VTC, multimedia, information technology (IT) equipment or network downtime in excess of a few minutes without impacting cost and mission execution.

Potential offers should take the BRAC relocations into account when responding to this notice for pre-BRAC support and  post-BRAC support requirements as they relate to high availability for  VTC, telepresence, audio conference, streaming, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV),  multimedia, unified communications and unified collaboration services at all supported locations.


3.	Description
To support this critical capability, MDA has standardized the VTC core operations on Tandberg VTC and CISCO switching equipment and operating systems at all MDA supported sites.  MDA has also standardized on AMX control systems for all integrated VTC systems and integrated multimedia facilities.

Furthermore, the enterprise support system, operated at the Video Services Operations Center (VSOC) at Schriever AFB, Colorado Springs, CO virtually operates and maintains multiple Tandberg Media Processing System (MPS), Video Communications Servers (VCS)  and 16 X 16 Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), both classified (at the Secret level) and unclassified.

In addition to the classified MCUs, the enterprise has encryption devices (such as KIV encryptors) that are provided to MDA customer sites for communicating with integrated services digital network (ISDN)/switched sites.  This infrastructure where connected via Internet Protocol (IP) is managed with the Tandberg Management Suites (TMS) (both unclassified and classified) via ISDN/IP secure switching technology.

MCUs/video bridges are stood up within NCR (classified Tandberg MPS) and at Schriever AFB, CO and Huntsville, AL (Polycom/Accord MGC 50 and Tandberg 16x16).

Also, at NCR there is a Polycom/Accord MGC 100 that is set-up as an unclassified audio bridge and provides MDA VTC call augmentation (addition of audio calls into VTC, and multimedia and , unified communications calls), as well as the ability to back-up MDA VTC in the event of system or network failures.

Future architectural plans include redundant VSOC facilities in the Huntsville, AL area, as well as migration of resources related to BRAC realignment.

The Contractor will manage, maintain, support and utilize the enterprise automated scheduling tool for conference room control and all audio and video teleconference scheduling. 

The referenced facilities all fall under the MDA Video Alliance (MVA) (MDAs internal video network).  

Some facilities are also a part of Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Video Services-Global (DVS-Gs) MDA VTC Community of Interest (COI).  The DVS-G MDA COI is one of many communities in the greater DISN DVS-G hierarchy.  

The MDA COI consists of a combination of .com, .mil, .gov, and .edu sites at various geographic locations throughout the United States and the Pacific (Kwajalein Atoll).

<p>-MRI compatible dynamic multi-modality heart phantom/DHP02<br />-Transport case<br /><br />A dynamic cardiac phantom is needed to provide technical evaluation of the CT/MR scanner and development/validation of new technology. The phantom must be capable of reproducing the motion of the left and right ventricle as realistic as possible. The material chosen to develop the phantom must be CT/MR compatible as well as having the CT/MR properties of tissue necessary to achieve similar attenuation/relaxation properties required to obtain a signal in vivo. In addition, the material must be compliant and capable of producing reproducible motion. Furthermore, the phantom should be able to accept external ECG signal to synchronize the timing of the contractions. A coronary artery model and user-friendly software interface for the control of motion and ECG is a significant plus.</p>

<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Phone 703-875-6629, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Department of State's  Office of Mobile Security Deployments (MSD) is the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's (DSS) crisis response force when an immediate armed response is required to protect Department employees, facilities and missions. MSD is responsible for providing crisis response to overseas posts and high-threat protective details, both domestically and abroad. MSD conducts three main missions in support of DSS. Security Support Teams (SST), Tactical Support Teams (TST), and Mobile Training Teams (MTT) MSD teams are small, mobile units that are prepared to deploy to anywhere in the world with 24-hour notice. Operations are currently being performed in operational OCONUS environments. These teams are usually supported by small mobile operational medical elements that have limited diagnostic, operative, holding, and resupply capability. Evacuation may entail an extremely long transport, in excess of 24-hours, from point of wounding to the forward/host country surgical team, then another long transport directly to a Level IV/V medical facility. Air superiority may be in question, especially the use of helicopters for initial patient evacuation. In these situations the tactical, logistic, and physiologic integration of triage concepts becomes of paramount importance SST and TST deployments are normally to high or critical threat areas where specialized security skills are required to protect life and ensure the safety of American Citizens living / working overseas.  These areas are generally austere and medically remote. SST and TST personnel must maintain the highest operational skill levels with regard to dealing with life-threatening traumatic and medical casualties, in tactical environments, coupled with prolonged transport times Domestic CONUS TST operations occur on a regular basis for high-threat protectees and may be supported by MSD TEMS as well. 

OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) notice is to survey the medical industry for potential sources of Tactical Emergency Medical Support to team with MSD to provide mission critical emergency medicine trainning, supplies and professional medical expertise.

The objective of this medical control relationship is to provide individuals assigned to the Office of Mobile Security Deployments Tactical Emergency Medical Support team (TEMS) with a medical director, allowing those individuals to function to the fullest scope of their Operational Medical Training and to give those individuals the authority to train and certify Diplomatic Security employees as medical providers with Advanced Operational Skill Sets and place those employees under MSDs medical direction and enable all medical providers, that meet required criteria, to perform life-saving interventions in austere, medically deprived, and remote areas of the world. In addition, this medical control relationship will provide them the ability to obtain a clinical hospital venue in order to practice and maintain their operational medical skill sets: 

Scope of Work:

The Contractor shall establish a medical control relationship between MSD TEMS and a board certified physician to be the designated medical director under whose responsibility, all operational and pre-hospital care by MSD and DS personnel, designated and certified by MSD TEMS, is rendered. 
If so desired, the Medical Director may delegate responsibilities of medical control to another fully licensed and credentialed physician or physicians assistant, within the contractor company who shall be designated as the Deputy Medical Director.
All contractor personnel who are to have direct interface with MSD TEMS personnel and/or operational needs will have to be eligible to have at least a Secret US government security clearance. 
The DS/T/MSD TEMS Program Manager (also functioning as the COTR for this contract) or the designated MSD TEMS Assistant Team Leader will maintain the duties of the direct and sole liaison for MSD and DS to the Deputy and Medical Director of the contractor for the purposes of supervision, coordination, maintaining, evaluating, and certifying activities of operational and training personnel in areas of Tactical and Operational medicine, including certified medical providers within MSD and DS. In addition, authorizing and/or certifying courses of medical instruction for MSD and DS.  
On-line medical control consultation via telephone and/or internet must be available at all times every day for the duration of the contract. 
Off-line medical control must be available for the term of the contract. This includes the development of standing order type medical protocols for all levels of MSD TEMS and DS operational medical providers within 60 days of contract award and subsequent monitoring and refinement as necessary. These protocols will reflect a tiered system of approach to a casualty and should enable the MSD TEMS medical system to be as autonomous as possible. These protocols will equip MSD TEMS and DS medical personnel with skill levels adequate to effectively deal with routine sick-call as well as  life-threatening emergencies within the providers scope of practice within austere and medically deprived areas of the world with prolonged evacuation times (24 hours or more) dovetailing the current operational medical guidelines.  
Establish criteria, support instruction, and provide MSD TEMS personnel a certification of curriculum for a Tactical First Responder course, to be offered 2 times per year by MSD TEMS or their designated medical instructor with a class size of approximately 10 to 20 (+/-) students per class. 
Provide MSD with, or assist in obtaining, an EMT-B training course for 10-18 students per year to be billed as utilized. 
Establish criteria, support instruction, and provide MSD medical personnel an EMT refresher course or certification of curriculum to be taught, in its entirety,  using operational and tactical modalities,  appropriate for 25-30 MSD personnel to apply for recertification through the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians at the EMT-B level. To be billed as utilized.    
Provide a hospital clinical site to support MSD medic training, and continuing education for EMT-B and the more advanced of MSD medical providers. This clinical site should allow for the practice of all operational skill sets and will be within a reasonable distance from MSD headquarters. 
Provide expert advice on force protection medical countermeasures for threats found through medical threat assessments (MTAs), conducted by MSD TEMS, on an as-needed basis. 
Provide deployable medical personnel assets for operational support of high risk, rural tactical operations to be reimbursed as utilized. 
Provide assistance with the procurement of appropriate medications and medical equipment to support MSD TEMS operations, including making available the medical directors DEA and state licensure for purchase of controlled items and items that require a physicians authorization. MSD TEMS will purchase the required medications and equipment through registered vendors outside of this contract, but with the assistance and oversight of the Medical Director. The contractor shall set-up a drug dispensing log book and accountability system to ensure control in compliance with DEA Diversion Investigators Manual policy. The MSD TEMS Program Manager and in his/her absence the TEMS Assistant Team Leader will be designated as the narcotic custodian for MSD. 
The contractor shall provide recommendations regarding the medical equipment and supplies utilized by MSD TEMS and DS operational medical providers in various missions.
Provide certification of curriculum for advanced operational skill set training and testing to be conducted by MSD TEMS medical personnel.
A system of case review, data collection and patient care evaluation shall be established and maintained to ensure proper quality control of rendered treatments and provide constructive feedback to the providers. 
At a mutually agreed upon schedule the contractor shall provide a 2 day, properly sanctioned and supervised, table top and TAC-EX live tissue training (LTT) in culmination of the 40-hour Tactical First Responder course utilizing the shoat model with weights approximate to tactical operators. This training may also couple as the final exam for advanced operational skill sets taught by MSD TEMS. This training should consist of realistic, scenario based exercises including all levels of MSD operational medical providers at their appropriate tier level during the training evolution. This training shall reflect MSD medical protocols. The contractor should send the appropriate number of personnel to provide close supervision and interaction with the students. This requirement includes, but is not limited to the following types of activities:
During the table top exercise on day one, significant emphasis should be placed on the successful execution of the standard skill sets.
During the TAC-EX on day two, significant emphasis should be placed on a tactical team approach to the casualty.

<DESC>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Patient Exam Gowns, Drapes, and Shorts  Disposable.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria <BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program, both Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is May 2010.  Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

<a href="mailto:Courtney.Redic@va.gov">Contract Specialist Intern</a>
<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).The VA is seeking a potential vendor to provide analytic and education support for the development and revision of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) as well as associated patient and provider tools and metrics to facilitate guideline implementation.  For each CPG, the contractor will orient/train Champions (designated VA and DoD subject matter experts), regarding the evidence-based approach and process, and assist the identified experts in defining the scope, objectives, timeline and production schedule, ensuring that all appropriate clinical specialties are involved with the initiative.  These work teams are composed of both VA and DoD personnel to ensure that both entities are fully engaged in the development of guidelines.  The Contractor will work with the Champions to define critical success factors and any actual or potential conflict of interest issues, and will discuss approaches to ensure VA/DoD collaboration with the broader community.  The CPG working group members, under the direction of the Champion(s), will provide the clinical expertise for guideline development/revisions in accordance with Guidelines for Guidelines (See Attachment 1).  The Contractor will provide support and serve as a communications coordinator for iterative editing and review of the recommendations to be incorporated in the guideline.  Support may also include researching and analyzing admissible evidence in pertinent literature and related studies that has become available since the publication of the original guideline; planning, conducting face-to-face meetings of the development group; facilitating and documenting expert work group sessions; coordinating the review of guideline revisions by designated work group members; reviewing guideline metrics for appropriateness and priority; reviewing provider education tools; grammatical/technical editing, and producing a revised guideline in the formats designated.  Most of the face-to-face meetings will be conducted in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area using space provided by the Contractor that is sufficient to accommodate 25-30 participants and VA/DoD administrative staff.The Contractor will work with the Champion(s) and other key clinical leaders to identify key questions to be answered by the evidence, within defined admissible boundaries, and will solicit comments, via the guideline development web site, from key clinical leaders, as well as a broader group of end users, to confirm the questions. Input will be presented to the guideline Champions and incorporated as appropriate.Participants involved in these efforts will be asked to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest.  (See Attachment 1)At the discretion of the Government, the Contractor may be asked to conduct systematic reviews of the clinical and academic evidence to support the guideline recommendations for each question. The searches will focus on the best available evidence to address each question, and ensure maximum coverage of studies at the top of the hierarchy of study types: evidence-based guidelines, meta analyses, and systematic reviews.  For any questions that cannot be answered by systematic reviews, the search will be extended using defined criteria identified by the guideline working group. The results of these extended searches will be organized and reported using reference manager software. The resulting libraries of studies for each question will be reviewed and analyzed. The Evidence Reports will include tables of evidence as well as: "	Summary of Findings"	Methodology"	Search terms"	Resources searched"	Articles critically appraised"	FindingsThe clinical experts will be guided in the review of the evidence and the evidence report for each question and will be oriented to the grading criteria proposed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Current Methods of the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force. Refining Evidence-Based Recommendation Development, Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. 147, No. 2, pp 117-124, July 17, 2007 - available at http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf07/methods/currprocess.pdf).  The Contractor is responsible for planning, coordinating and facilitating meetings and conference calls with designated guideline Champion(s) and work group members.  VA's VANTS line conferencing system will be used whenever possible for ongoing development work outside of the face-to-face meeting. The Contractor will use methods and tools to optimize work group members' time and resources; and document work group activities and output.

Guideline Development and Approval Process:1.  New Guideline Idea: When a clinician or other group wants to develop a VA/DoD guideline, "	an application is completed and submitted to VA/DoD Evidence Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG).  o	At a minimum the application will include a description of the guideline, o	Identify end-users of the guideline and perceived gaps in care and/or o	Identify changes in performance to be driven by the guideline. (See Attachment I: Application Form)   o	To the extent possible, data substantiating the need for the guideline will be presented.   "	The applicant will also submit a brief structured review of the literature.  "	The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group may also suggest topics/areas for guideline development using the same process described above, particularly as they relate to the frequency of occurrence and uniqueness of our military and veteran population.2.	Evidence Based Practice Work Group Prioritization Sub Group Reviews & Prioritizes Applications:  Upon receipt of the application, the EBPWG Prioritization Sub Group will review the application and prioritize it for development and implementation in VHA and DoD. "	Within 1 week of receipt, the Chairperson, EBPWG Prioritization Sub Group, will acknowledge receipt of each application.  "	The EBPWG Prioritization Sub Group will consider the following issues: o	High incidence or prevalence, o	Risk and cost of the disease or condition in the general veteran/military population or sub-populations targeted by Special Emphasis Programs.  o	Potential for reduction of clinically significant variations in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or clinical management of a disease or condition will also be considered when establishing priorities.  "	The Co-Chairs of the Prioritization Subgroup will notify the applicant of the outcome of the review generally within 4 weeks of receipt.  "	3.  Designees of the DoD, Offices of Quality and Performance, and VA Patient Care Services  Identify Clinical Champions, Evidence Chaperone and /or EBPWG Representative: When a topic has been approved for guideline development, the DoD representatives, Offices of Quality and Performance and Patient Care Service, "	Will Identify clinical leaders who will champion the guideline development and implementation initiative at the national VA and DoD Health Care Systems levels.  "	Assure there is representation from primary care and specialty services.  "	Invite members of related QUERI (Quality Enhancement Research Initiative) groups to participate.  "	Assign an Evidence Chaperone to guide the integrity of the evidence process.  "	Assign a representative from the EBPWG to monitor the development process.4.  Pre-Planning Conference:The Offices of Quality and Performance and Patient Care Services, in collaboration with Employee Education System, will convene a face-to-face pre-planning conference or teleconference with the identified champion(s) and other key clinical leaders in order to train champions regarding the evidence-based approach and process.  At a minimum, the pre-planning conference/teleconference should accomplish the following:   "	Identify the end users of the guideline."	Define the scope of the Guideline Initiative."	Identify seed/reference guidelines, if any."	Specify representation from appropriate clinical specialties to be involved with the guideline development."	Project timelines for each phase of guideline development."	Disclose any areas of potential conflict of interest"	Assign senior champions for each module."	Develop a production schedule for each module."	Specify which modules can be fast-tracked for distribution prior to publication of the comprehensive guideline."	Identify approaches that will ensure VA and DoD collaboration and partnership with the broader community."	Define responsibilities of champions and participants.5.  Small Group of Champion(s) and Other Key Clinical Leaders are Assembled:  "	VA and DOD Champions and other key clinical leaders meet face-to-face/teleconference, as needed, with the facilitator and Evidence Chaperone to identify key questions formulated in the PICO format to be answered by the evidence "	This is an iterative process and may require discussions on conference calls to complete the task.  "	Boundaries for admissible evidence should also be set.  For example, questions of the efficacy of interventions usually means that randomized controlled trials should be sought, while questions of risk usually means that prospective cohort studies should be sought.  "	Evidence-based bullets for immediate publication should also be identified. "	Potential Conflicts of Interest: The VA/DoD has adopted a policy of transparency, disclosing potential conflicts and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision, and review of the VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines.  Champion(s) and other key clinical leaders involved with this effort will be asked to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (See Attachment II).  "	Once the Scope of the Guideline is agreed on by the CoChairs and other key leaders, it is sent for review and approval by the VA/DoD EBPWG membership.  On approval by the VA/DoD EBPWG, the guideline workgroup can begin.6. Conference Call among Evidence Chaperone, Champions and EBPWG Representative is conducted:  "	When the questions have been developed, the group will convene via conference calls to: o	review the questions to assure that they are on track and o	address the questions that will lead to a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature pertaining to the topic.  "	When the evidence reviews are completed, the questions and the reviews will be posted on the web.  "	However, prior to posting the reviews, the facilitator, Champion and the Evidence Chaperone will convene to ensure the adequacy of the evidence reviews.  	 7. Systematic Review of the Literature Based on the Questions Identified in Step Five is Conducted & Tables of Evidence are Produced: "	A systematic review of the literature, by a disinterested party, will be performed to minimize bias, collect all appropriate evidence available and assess its potential applicability to the clinical question under consideration. "	The Evidence Chaperone will work with Evidence center staff to ensure conformity to prevailing standards for conducting high-quality systematic literature reviews.  o	The first step in gathering the evidence is to see if a suitable, recent systematic review has already been published. o	If a current systematic review is not available, an original systematic review will be done using an established protocol, such as those of the Cochrane Collaboration or the US Preventive Services Task Force.  "	At a minimum, systematic reviews will use explicit, reproducible methods to o	 identify relevant, eligible studies o	 assess the quality of each study and of the body of evidence o	 critically appraise key studies ando	 synthesize results.  "	To grade the quality of individual studies, the reviews will apply the USPSTF criteria for quality [Harris RP, Helfand M, etc], adapting those to specific clinical areas.8. A Group of Clinical Experts is Convened to Develop the Guideline: Once the evidence tables have been developed, "	A group of not more than 15-20 experts and other key clinical leaders will be identified and convened to evaluate the evidence and develop the guideline in accordance with it.  "	In advance of the meeting, each participant will be asked to submit a disclosure statement regarding any potential conflicts of interest.  These will be reviewed in advance to assure balance in the group that is forming.  "	Each meeting will begin with a brief session that will permit full disclosure to the group  any conflicts related to the guideline "	Key points of the guideline will be identified.  "	A facilitator, in collaboration with the Evidence Chaperone, will ensure that the meeting stays focused and that the evidence remains the driving force behind the guidelines.  "	Most guidelines will be represented in an algorithmic format outlining step-by-step decision points in the disease management process.  "	The strength of recommendation and quality of evidence are provided at the end of each annotation in the guideline. "	The systematic review will summarize the quality and consistency of the evidence and the magnitude of benefits and harms. "	To make the actual recommendations, the clinical experts, led by the designated VA/DoD Champions, will o	interpret the evidence, o	assess its ability to be applied in the clinical setting and its applicability to the population of interest, and o	assess the overall strength of evidence for the recommendation.  "	Recommendations based solely on clinical judgment and experience will be thoroughly scrutinized to eliminate bias and self-interest.  "	This group of clinical experts will also develop consensus-based recommendations as needed when there is inadequate evidence.   The clinical experts will grade recommendations using the system described in Current Methods of the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force.  A Review of the Process. Am J Prev Med 2001.  In this system, the grade for the strength of a recommendation depends on the overall quality of evidence and on the magnitude of net benefit.  Clinical experts will:1.	Rate the overall quality of the evidence using the terms shown in Table 1.2.	Rate the net benefit (benefits minus harms) "substantial," "moderate," "small," or "zero or negative" as described in Table 2.Based on these ratings of the overall quality of the evidence and the magnitude of net benefit, the clinical experts will assign a grade to each recommendation using the definitions in Tables 3 and 4.         	TABLE 1:	Overall QualityI	High grade evidence (I or II-1) directly linked to health outcomeII	High grade evidence (I or II-1) linked to intermediate outcome orModerate grade evidence (II-2 or II-3) directly linked to health outcomeIII	Level III evidence  or no linkage of evidence to health outcome IV	Insufficient EvidenceTABLE 2: Net Effect of the InterventionSubstantial	More than a small relative impact on a frequent condition with a substantial burden of suffering  - or -A large impact on an infrequent condition with a significant impact on the individual patient level.Moderate	A small relative impact on a frequent condition with a substantial burden of suffering  - or -A moderate impact on an infrequent condition with a significant impact on the individual patient level.Small	A negligible relative impact on a frequent condition with a substantial burden of suffering   - or -A small impact on an infrequent condition with a significant impact on the individual patient level.Zero or  Negative 	Negative impact on patients  -  or -No relative impact on either a frequent condition with a substantial burden of suffering   - or -An infrequent condition with a significant impact on the individual patient level.      Table 3.

The First Draft of the Guideline will be posted on a Development Website for Field Review and Comment: "	DoD Evidence-based Practice Division, Patient Care Services and the VA Network Clinical Managers will solicit feedback from a broader group of end users.  "	VA Network designated staff and DoD end users will be asked to test the guideline in the direct care setting and provide feedback to the Guideline Champions and/or directly to the guideline development experts via the web page which is available for online comment. "	This portion of the field test is more specifically directed towards an evaluation of the content and the logic and flow of the guideline.  "	Comments and recommendations regarding proposed changes to the content of the guideline must be supported by evidence.  "	The VA/DoD Guideline Champions will reply to the respondents and will integrate comments and suggestions into the evidence review as appropriate.  11. An executive panel of the work group re-convenes to finalize the guideline and identify the content of the provider education tools: "	The executive panel will be reconvened to integrate the comments of the reviewers, as appropriate, and to complete the guideline.  "	At this same face-to-face meeting, the group will also begin to identify the components of the guideline summary, pocket card, health tips and performance measures that could be used to assess guideline implementation and outcomes.  "	Emphasis will be placed to assure that level of evidence for the recommendations captured in the pocket card, key points card, and/or health tips, etc. is identified on the printed materials. "	All guideline modules must contain the date of the last systematic evidence review. Step 12: There are 2 Steps in the Review of the Final Guideline Draft:12 A: The Final Draft of the Guideline and provider tools are posted on the web for review and comment: "	This portion of the review is directed towards an evaluation of the content of the recommendation, the logic of the algorithm, and the format and usability of the guideline."	Comments and recommendations regarding proposed changes to the content of the guideline must be supported by evidence.  "	A summary of the comments and suggestions collected through the web page will be sent to the champion/executive panel of the working group12 B: The Final Draft is then submitted for Independent Review: "	The final draft of the guideline is assigned to at least three VA /DoD staff or outside national experts who have been trained scientific review and have agreed to perform an independent review of each guideline.  "	This independent review is directed towards an evaluation of the content of the guideline, as well as the format and usability of the guideline. "	The rating tool containing the reviewer's comments and recommendations will be forwarded to the Office of Quality and Performance and the Co Chairs of the EBPWG/subcommittee. (See Attachment III)"	The reviewer's comments and recommendations regarding the content of the guideline will be provided to the champions / the executive panel of the working group.13.	Final Editing Incorporates Feedback as Appropriate: "	The Champion(s), in consultation with key experts from the editorial panel of the guideline, and the facilitator and the Evidence Chaperone will integrate the comments and suggestions into the final document as appropriate. This includes the guideline summary and provider education tools."	Discussion of serious controversies regarding interpretation of the evidence will be included in the introduction to the guideline and may be the subject of discussion at the time of review with the EBPWG."	All EBPWG members are expected to review the guideline and submit comments to the Co Chair/designee at least 5 days before the work group meeting to minimize discussion at the meeting. 14.  The Final Guideline, Tools, and Comments from Independent Review are Submitted to VA/DoD Evidence Based Practice Workgroup Subgroup for Review: "	The  VA/DoD EBPWG again reviews comments from independent reviewers and verifies that all appropriate suggestions have been incorporated into the final document.   "	An electronic copy of the guideline along with a summary of the comments from the reviewers will be provided to the entire VA/DoD EBPWG at least two weeks in advance of the meeting.15. Presentation of Guideline to VA/DoD EBPWG for Approval: "	When the EBPWG is convened, the Champion(s) and the Evidence Chaperone will present the guideline to the EBPWG and recommend endorsement for implementation throughout VHA.  "	The Senior Champion(s) will hear the deliberations of the EBPWG and will be provided feedback that will be entered into the minutes of the EBPWG."	The Guideline will then be either endorsed or further modifications will be made. "	When endorsed, Employee Education System will put the tools into final format.16.  EBPWG Forwards Recommendations to OQP , PCS and appropriate offices for Concurrence/Approval: "	Within 3 weeks following the meeting of the EBPWG, the recommendations of the EBPWG and a summary of the guideline and the provider tools will be forwarded to the Under Secretary for Health for signature and distribution. "	If there is disagreement with the EBPWG's recommendations, the guideline will be returned to the VA/DoD Co Chairpersons for action.17.  The Guideline and Other Related Tools are Posted on the Office of Quality and Performance (http://www.healthquality.gov   All guidelines placed on the Web will conform to the requirements described in Section 508.29 U.S.C. &798 of the Rehabilitation Act. (See http://www.va.gov/accessible/disvetres.html). B.	Guideline Update and Approval Process: 1.  Evidence Based Practice Work Group Approves Schedule for Update of Clinical Practice Guidelines:  The immediate update of guidelines will be triggered if any recommendation contained in a guideline is identified as harmful to patients (i.e., pharmaceutical or device recall, etc.)  Routine guideline updates will ideally occur approximately every two years.  The process that will be followed closely mirrors that of guideline development.

<DESC>Sources Sought and Request for InformationVeterans Health Administration (VHA) Health Risk Assessment Acquisition and IntegrationThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking sources and information for system integration of an online Health Risk Assessment (HRA) tool for use by patients and clinicians within the Veterans Health Administration.  The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge and information for the purposes of market research.  Information gained by this request may or may not result in a subsequent solicitation.  This Sources Sought (SS) Notice and Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services.  Responses to this notice shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The VA will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this notice. The responder must clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses will not be returned.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated and incurred by responding to this notice. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this noticeBackground:  The VHA provides the national healthcare system for United States' Veterans. These services are provided by 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), administering 154 full-service hospitals, psychiatric facilities, community living centers, Veteran centers, research facilities, rehabilitation facilities and 675 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics. Comprehensive health care is provided through primary, tertiary, and long-term care in the areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics, spinal cord injury, women's health and extended care.  The VHA uses a decentralized electronic medical record (EMR) system within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and its next generation "HealtheVet".  The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is the graphical user interface through which VA staff access an individual's electronic medical records within VISTA.  Further, the VHA has an online patient portal called "My HealtheVet" (www.myhealth.va.gov ).  My HealtheVet is an Internet-based program that creates a new, online environment where veterans, family, and clinicians come together to optimize veterans' health care.  It provides trusted information, online services, limited health record access, and messaging between veterans and clinicians.  The VHA is seeking information to plan for a future acquisition of a patient-entered Health Risk Assessment tool, integrated into My HealtheVet and the VHA's current electronic medical record.  Health Risk Assessments (HRA) are instruments that collect information from individuals through the use of structured questionnaires. HRAs often provide tailored feedback to the individual about his or her health status, with specific recommended steps to improve health. Core features of an HRA include assessment of personal information, past medical and surgical history, medications, family history, health behaviors (use of tobacco, alcohol, diet, physical activity, etc.), and receipt of preventive care (screenings and immunizations, etc.). Elements also desirable include information of self-care management for common chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, health risks relevant to the elderly (such as fall risk), and readiness-to-change for health behaviors that increase patient risk for disease and/or injury.  Requested Information:  Respondents shall provide a general capabilities statement to address the information requested below.  Based on an initial review of the capabilities statement submitted, respondents may be asked to give an oral presentation that includes a real-time demonstration of the HRA product and capabilities. 1.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for GPS Corner Collection in Colorado.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  The Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) is the digital portrayal of the PLSS and is assembled in a series of working ascii files and a geo-database for publication.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.
This task will involve collecting geographic coordinates on approximately 1250 corners of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) across 125 townships.  Most corners will be section corners but some will be mineral survey corners that have not been visited since they were originally set in the 1800s.  The goal is to reasonably depict these areas in GCDB.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.
Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis Taconic Farm, Inc., One Hudson City Centre, Hudson, NY 12534.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires Mutant Mice - CSMD1 knockout mice  Minimum of 4, Heterzygous for the selected mutation, including at least one breeding pair to include a validated genotyping protocol and animal health data.  The Molecular Neurobiology Research Branch plans to study the effects of deletion of the CSMD1 gene and several different models of the behavioral and psychological effects of cocaine, such as the acute locomotor effects, the ability of cocaine to induce conditioned locomotion (locomotion in response to an environment previously associated with the drug), and conditioned place preference (approach to a location previously associated with the drug). Taconic Farms, Inc. is the only company that sells CSMD1 knockout mice and since clusters of snps in the CSMD1 gene were found to be positively associated with addiction, we only want CSMD1 knockout mice at this time.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

The Mobile District Corps of Engineers is currently designing the Two Step Turbine Engine Dry Air Capability Project (TEDAC), Phase 2 at Arnold AFB, TN.<BR><BR>TEDAC Phase 2 requires the demolition and replacement of two existing low temperature refrigeration systems (total capacity approximately 6000 tons of refrigeration) supplying refrigerated brine to a 42 foot diameter by 150 foot long cooler used to dry process air. The process air is used for jet engine testing.  The existing chiller systems, designated RC 13 and RC 14, are multistage centrifugal units supplied by Carrier.  Each of the two existing refrigeration systems utilize liquid chillers containing three compressors each for a total of six compressors.  The existing chillers use R-12 refrigerant with trichloroethylene as the secondary brine.  RC13 cools a maximum flow rate of 1200 lb/s of air at 40 psia and 38 degrees Fahrenheit saturated to 0 degrees Fahrenheit saturated.  RC 14 cools the same air flow at the same pressure from 0 to -24 degrees Fahrenheit saturated.  The nominal capacity of RC 13 is 3800 tons at an installed horsepower of 8500 hp (two low stage compressors at 2000 hp each and one high stage at 4500 hp).  The capacity of RC 14 is 2200 tons at an installed horsepower of 7000 hp (two low stages at 1500 hp each and one high stage at 4000 hp).  The nominal performance of RC13 and RC14 are as follows:<BR><BR>RC 13		Dynalene HC 40 flow rate = 12,000 gpm<BR>		Chiller evaporator inlet temp = -6.5 degrees Fahrenheit<BR>		Chiller evaporator outlet temp = -15 degrees Fahrenheit	<BR>		Condenser water inlet temp = 80 degrees Fahrenheit<BR>		Condenser water outlet temp = 95 degrees Fahrenheit maximum	<BR>		Condenser water flow rate = tbd<BR><BR>RC 14 	Dynalene HC 40 flow rate = 16,000 gpm<BR>		Chiller evaporator inlet temp = -31.3 degrees Fahrenheit<BR>		Chiller evaporator outlet temp = -35 degrees Fahrenheit	<BR>		Condenser water inlet temp = 80 degrees Fahrenheit<BR>		Condenser water outlet temp = 95 degrees Fahrenheit maximum	<BR>		Condenser water flow rate = tbd<BR><BR>Condenser water design temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit and ranges from 40 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  Condenser water design pressure range is 100 psig and ranges from 80 to 105 psig.  Electrical power for the chillers will be 6900 VAC and 60 Hz.<BR><BR>The new brine chillers are required to utilize no more than two compressors with a total of four compressors for the entire replacement refrigeration systems.  The new chillers shall utilize R-134a or R-507a refrigerant and Dynalene HC-40 will be the secondary brine.  Each chiller shall be designed such that if one compressor of a single chiller goes out of service at least 50% of the total combined chiller capacity of both chillers shall be maintained.  50% capacity is designated as the refrigeration demand to provide -24 degree F leaving air temperature across a coil bank at an airflow of 600 lb/sec.<BR><BR>The existing chiller system consisting of six compressors is maintenance intensive and costly.  Through limiting the number of compressors in the new refrigeration systems to four in lieu of the existing six compressors, system maintenance costs may be reduced by 33%.<BR><BR>Brine chillers must meet the requirements below for consideration as a substitute for those as designed by York by Johnson Controls of York, PA.<BR><BR>1) Each new brine chiller shall contain no more than two compressors.<BR>2) Brine chillers shall meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the attached specification, 23 64 10, Brine Chillers.<BR>3) Refrigerant shall be either R-134a or R-507a refrigerant.<BR><BR>This request is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. It is for information only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation. The purpose of this Sources Sought request is to obtain sources for brine chillers endorsed by each manufacturer. If no sources exist that can fully meet the requirements contained in this request (100%), then it is the Governments intent to specify York by Johnson Controls brine chillers for use in the Two Step Turbine Engine Dry Air Capability Project (TEDAC), Phase 2 and/or other facilities. Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufacturers name, product data and written statement of compatibility. The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.<BR><BR>The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. Costs to test and evaluate acceptable brines shall not be the responsibility of the Government. The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.<BR><BR>Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.5 to Dynamic Systems and Research Inc., 8219 Pickard Avenue NE, Albuquerque, NM  87110.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures  --- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Dynamic Systems and Research, Inc. is the only known source capable of meeting the Governments requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the electrically operated spool valve, Orifice Reduction System (ORC) and Expansion Tank (ET).  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than Thursday, 11 March 3:30 P.M., CST.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determing whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>The Structural Mechanics Branch, Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL), US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), requested and was granted strategic equipment funds to procure an upgrade to the pressure release system on the 200,000 pound dynamic loader located in the Blast Load Building 5008.  This loader is used to perform destructive dynamic tests on materials and various test specimens designed and developed by the ERDC.  This upgrade is directly related to GSLs material testing facilities and will enhance its dynamic testing capabilities. <BR><BR>The 200,000 pound dynamic loader is a unique one-of-a-kind device capable of applying large loads to a test piece in less than 3 to 5 milli-seconds.  The QRV pressure release system allows the loader to function properly within the aforementioned time.  The upgrade to the loaders pressure release system will require an identical type of QRV (with exception to the size and pressure rating) as the existing (current) QRV.   <BR><BR>This type of special QRV was produced by Seco-Dyne Inc., of California.  The special proprietary design and vulcanized seals inside the valve, allowing it to operate both at high pressures and at the required speed, made Seco-Dyne the only source for this type of valve for many years until its closure in 2008.  Seco-Dyne Inc., is no longer available for new construction or for the repair of older valves.<BR><BR>Dynamic Systems and Research, Inc., (DSR) is a small research and development company located in Albuquerque, NM, that specializes in dynamic flow of liquids and gases.  The president of DSR has worked, indirectly, on dynamic valve systems through research activities and interactions with Seco-Dyne prior to its closure.  In the absence of Seco-Dyne, DSR has seen a commercial need for dynamic valve systems across a wide variety of industries and they have invested in the development of a dynamic valve product line to reestablish the availability of this type of special valve.  DSR is adequately and uniquely capable of delivering the 4.5-inch-diameter spool valve proposed in this effort.<BR><BR>Technical POC:  Stephen Rowell, 601-634-2533, stephen.p.rowell@usace.army.mil.

Offerors are required to submit their proposals in two separate volumes as follows:

Volume 1 - Technical (include supporting documentation as attachments to the technical volume, such as resumes, past performance references, Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), and certifications)

This volume shall contain the Technical Approach.  This volume should not be a reiteration of the Statement of Work.  This portion of the proosal shall exclude any refernce to the pricing aspects of each offer.  If an equal to product is proposed, offeror shall demonstrate how that product is equal to the brand name product.   Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail a technical approach that will meet the requirements specified in the SOW (attachment #1) and salient characteristics / comaptability requirements (attachment #2).  


Volume 2- Pricing Proposal

The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto.  Alternate proposals are not authorized.  Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitue deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable.  

This volume shall include complete pricing for line items 1-12 on Attachment A: SF 1449 solicitation document.  Contractors shall use Attachment D, titled IDIQ Pricing Attachment for providing prices associated with the IDIQ line item (Line item no. 12 on SF1449).  In addition to the fixed price tasks the contractor shall also provide a Schedule of Labor Categories and On-Site / Off-Site fixed price Labor Rates for a base plus four option periods (also on attachment D).

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

1) Technical Understanding and Approach. The proposed content will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in SOW (see Attachment B: SOW and other terms and conditions) and demonstrate the ability to meet the salient characteristics and compatibility requirements (Attachment C: Compatibility Requirements).  The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement. 

2) Past Performance: Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed with other federal agencies during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offer or has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services. This is a matter of judgment. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's past performance record. Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance. Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.

3) Key Personnel. Proposed key personnel must demonstrate their expertise, experience, knowledge in administrative, migration of repositories, conversion of SoDA reports to BIRT, trouble shootings, technical expertise and training of Requisite Pro and its components.  

4) Price. The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options. Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

 (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This notice is considered to be Solicitation AG-0116-S-10-0027 and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

This solicitation incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-38.

This requirement is totally set-aside for small business concerns.  NAICS code 335999 is applicable. The small business size standard for this code is: 500 employees.

Line Item 1:  Provide, install, and prepare for operation a Fuel Cell for Wrangell Floating Camp in accordance with attached specification, drawings and terms.

Provide with your quote a cost breakdown for materials, labor, transportation, and expenses  the work to be performed in Wrangell, Alaska (or at the remote location) to include:
	New, unused fuel cell
	All associated equipment
	All freight costs to Wrangell, Alaska
	All travel expenses for travel, lodging, per diem for technician(s)
	All wages for technician(s)
	All parts and components for storage and approved means of transporting of the fuel
	Approximately 50 gallons of fuel supply for commissioning and beginning operation
	All other incidental expenses

SPECIFICATIONS,  TERMS AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION

INTRODUCTION
Request for quote to provide one commercially available fuel cell and associated equipment that will be placed on a small 4-person float house.  The fuel cell will provide backup power to an existing battery bank that is part of an existing solar array/inverter/battery bank electrical system. The fuel cell will run only when the solar array cannot keep the batteries charged. The inverter will automatically start the fuel cell under normal conditions via a dry contact. The fuel cell shall also be able to sense the batteries and start as needed in case the inverter is shut down when not in use.

Photos, float layout plan, and existing electrical system one-line diagram are attached.

BACKGROUND
The float house is used on the Tongass National Forest. Currently the float house is located in the harbor in Wrangell, Alaska. We would like to have the fuel cell installed and operational no later than May 10th, 2010. After that date, the float house will be deployed about 27 miles southeast of Wrangell, Alaska at Anan Bay. At that site, the float house is typically used just during the summer months. However, it can be moved to any location as needed and also be used during the winter months. 
This project will be part of a pilot study on the use of fuel cells at the remote field camp sites on the Tongass National Forest. 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
Weather and environmental conditions in Southeast Alaska can vary greatly. For example annual rainfall varies from 29 in Skagway to over 200 just 200 miles away. Average annual snowfall can be from 40 to 260. The temperatures can get exceed 80F on occasion in the summer and dip down into the teens during the winter. The coldest recorded temperature was -28F in 1991 and highs have been known to hit the 90F mark. Wind is highly variable - it can be calm one minute and blow for days on end with gusts in access of 100 knots. Our intent is not to place our facility at locations exposed to heavy weather conditions but they have been exposed to these conditions even in the most sheltered areas. Humidity is consistently in the high 90% all year around. The Inside Passage of Southeast Alaska is saltwater so it does not freeze. The combination of sheltered area and the consistent precipitation keeps the salt in the air level down however it is to be expected that any exposed service shall be able to withstand contact from salt water.  

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
	Produce a minimum 200 watts continuously to our battery bank
	Provide 24 volts DC nominal and adjustable for different type of batteries
	Shall be a proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cell
	Shall run on liquid, non-corrosive fuel, preferably methanol. 
	Fuel supply shall be readily available either by:
o	Small factory sealed containers for safe transport to remote site by small boat or
o	A factory, EPA, and DOT approved fuel distribution system from bulk storage to transportable and approved vessels that can be transported to the site then reused without contamination to the fuel from dirt and water 
	Provide a list of suppliers for the fuel supply selected 
	Shall be autonomous that can run fully automatically without any outside interaction
	Shall be able to turn on and off by customer supplied remote dry contact
o	Will need to know contact requirements for customer supplied contact

	Shall be able to function in temperatures below 0C
	Shall be able to be safely winterized and stored in temperatures below 0C
	Required routine maintenance shall be able to be done by general maintenance staff with no technical knowledge of fuel cells
	Fuel cell shall weigh less than 75 pounds to allow government transport to/from the mooring site for factory maintenance or winter storage. Government transport is by either small watercraft or float plane
	Provide standard warranty information of the fuel cell and associated components
	Provide brief description of factory technical support
	Provide brief description of customer electrical control requirements
	Provide any requirements for hazardous location electrical for area around fuel cell
	Provide a qualified technician for the on-site installation, commissioning, and operating instructions of the fuel cell. A qualified Forest Service representative will be available during installation that will run the inverter system and programming of the inverter as needed. 

PROPOSAL
The proposal shall consist of a general description and cut sheets of the fuel cell and associated equipment showing how the proposed fuel cell meets or exceeds the System Requirements listed above. Describe briefly what type and levels of emission to expect, as well as the reason for the emissions. Describe the fuel type, handling, and shelf life of the fuel used in the fuel cell. Indicate the on-site installation time period if the proposed system is selected. If that time period is after May 10th, 2010, indicate how you accomplish the work in a remote field setting. The Forest Service will provide transportation of equipment and personnel from Wrangell, Alaska, to the remote site where the float house is moored. Rustic government lodging may be available at the remote site depending on the number of technicians needed for installation, and the time period and duration of the field installation. Please submit your proposal and quote electronically by the close of business no later than the date listed in the solicitation.

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. 
(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS+4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offerors name and address. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet 


(f) Instructions to Offerors:  
Quotations are expected to conform to solicitation provisions and be prepared in accordance with this section.  To aid in evaluation, the quotations shall be clearly and concisely written as well as being neat, indexed (cross-indexed as appropriate) and logically assembled.  All pages of each part shall be appropriately numbered and identified with the name of the offeror, the date, and the solicitation number.  A one page transmittal letter signed by an individual authorized to commit the organization shall transmitted with the quotation to the Government.  Each quotation shall be on 8 and -inch x 11-inch paper, in a commercially standard font, not smaller than 12 point font.  Each page in the quotation shall be separately numbered. The quotation shall be limited to ten (10) single-sided pages, single-spaced (excluding letter of transmittal, resumes, representations, certifications, cover letter and letters of commitment and past performance).
(1) Quotation Content:   Each quotation shall consist of three (3) separate electronic files: (a) Business Quotation and (b) Technical Quotation and (c) Price.  The contents of each shall be as follows:
A.	Business Quotation:  Shall include the items listed above (from 1 to 10). 
B.	Technical Quotation Content:  No pricing information shall be included in the technical quotation. The technical quotation shall include the following:
	1.  Technical Specifications 
(a)  The offeror shall submit a technical description for the work it is proposing, which clearly discusses the specifications, design, quality, and parts to be use.  The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed approach meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description. 
2.  Experience
Offeror shall describe their general background, experience, and qualifications of the organization as it relates to projects of a similar size, scope and nature to this requirement.  Offeror shall demonstrate extensive experience and familiarity with the assembly of cylinder truck body/bed onto a 2010 Ford, F750 D Rated up to 25,999 GVW
3. Price
  	The offerors price quote shall include:
a.	Offerors are expected to submit a fixed price (all inclusive) for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for this requirement.   

XI.	FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION  COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (ADDENDUM)
The Government intends to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced Offeror or to the Offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contract Specialist determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
Upon receipt of proposals, the Contract Specialist will review them to determine if each Offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation.  An offer that doesnt follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be consider for further evaluation.  
Each offeror will be evaluated against the factors described below.  An Offerors failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the Offerors lack of understanding of the Governments requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable.   Non- Price factors 1 through 2 are listed in descending order of importance.  Non-price factors 1 and 2, when combined together, are more important than price. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.  
The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Governments interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.   The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offerors initial quotation should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.    
Evaluation Factors:
1.	Technical Specifications
Evaluation of technical specification shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed specification, design, quality and parts to be used meets or exceeds the minimum specifications.  Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed solution that meets all specifications will not be considered further for award.   If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed approach meets a certain minimum specification, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will also give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed solution exceeds NISTs specifications.  
 2.  Experience
NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience in providing similar services to determine the nature and extent of the offerors successful completion of similar services related to the assembly of truck body/beds. 
3.	 Price
The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored.  The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are realistic, complete and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements.  Proposed prices must be entirely compatible with the technical quotations.   Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored.
 XIII. Delivery: 
1.	Delivery shall be FOB Destination to:
           National Institute of Standards and Technology
           Building 301 Shipping and Receiving
           100 Bureau Drive 
           Gaithersburg, MD 20899-001
2.	All quotes shall be submitted so that they are received no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time on March 17, 2010 at ricardo.cordero@nist.gov, with a courtesy copy to william.li@nist.gov.  Faxed quotes will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI10070 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-38 dated December 10, 2009. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to procure CD3 on a sole source basis with BD Biosciences. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) CD3, CY7 APC, #557757, lot #68685, qty-938 vials. This reagent is a mouse 1Gg1 isotype monoclonal antibody that cross-reacts with a major subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes, but not monocytes or granulocytes, of baboon, and rhesus, cynomolgous, and pigtail macaque monkeys. BD Biosciences has produced a lot of CD3 Cy7 APC that has been tested and approved by the Laboratory of Immunogenicity T-Cell and Antibody. This lot of reagent fits well into current staining panels in place in the lab. In addition, this lot has been shown to provide reliable staining of pertinent cell populations, allowing for differentiation between different cell types, so replacing it with another product would be extremely costly and inefficient. Any attempt to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data from previous trial runs. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price and 2) capability to meet required specifications.&nbsp; Place of delivery Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878.&nbsp; Delivery 30 days from receipt of award. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders - Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds, FAR 52.232.33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Center Contractor Registration. In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201 (a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov prior to award during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 23, 2010.

This procurement is unrestricted with the assigned North American Industry Classification System code 524113, Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Underwriting, and the small business size standard $7 million. The Contractor shall provide business travel insurance coverage and services for the Office of Thrift Supervision employees.
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Business Travel Accident (BTA) Insurance</p>
<p>I. Background and Objectives</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is a non-appropriated federal financial regulatory bureau of the Department of the Treasury with approximately 998 employees nationwide. Its income is primarily derived from assessments collected from savings and loans and interest earned on the portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities. OTS is responsible for regulating the thrift industry.</p>
<p>As a non-appropriated agency, OTS is statutorily exempt from a number of pay benefits programs generally applicable to Federal agencies and their employees. OTS employees are eligible to participate in the group life insurance and group health benefits programs available to federal government employees. OTS has also developed its own benefit programs as a supplement to the federal benefit programs. The OTS sponsored programs include group term life insurance, business travel accident insurance, long-term disability insurance, and flexible spending accounts.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>OTS seeks an experienced and qualified insurance company to underwrite and administer its Business Travel Accident Insurance program (BTA) for its active employees and their dependents.</p>
<p>All permanent employees and full-time temporary employees, whose appointments are for at least one year and consist of a pre-arranged regularly scheduled tour of duty, are automatically covered by the BTA program as soon as they enter on duty. The OTS pays the full premium cost for the BTA coverage. The coverage offers protection against accidental death and dismemberment for employees while in a travel status.</p>
<p>II. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The Contractor shall administer and underwrite a group BTA plan that provides insurance for covered accidents that result in the loss of life, limbs, speech, hearing or eyesight while OTS employees are traveling on official OTS authorized business. The Plan shall assure that the current OTS BTA coverage will be extended to all eligible employees in the Washington area as well as those throughout the country.</p>
<p>Proposals are hereby sought on the current BTA plan design as described in the OTS summary plan description. All current benefit plan provisions of the OTS BTA plan must remain intact. Therefore, it is imperative that offerors carefully read the enclosed plan description (Attachment A). Any deviations should be explained in detail; however, such deviations may not be accepted by OTS.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following items:</p>
<p>&bull; Master policy and certificate within six weeks following the effective date of the contract;<br />&bull; Claim forms, beneficiary forms in paper and electronic formats whenever possible;<br />&bull; Annual claim reports listing the name of insured, date of accident or death, benefit amount paid and interest paid;<br />&bull; Appointment of an account manager to respond to plan administration issues and serves as a liaison with OTS's Contractor Officer's Technical Representative (COTR);<br />&bull; A provision of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect any OTS information maintained in the contractor's custody; and <br />&bull; Preparation of an administrative manual (minimum of three (3) copies)<br /><br /><br /><br />Attachment A: OTS Business Travel Accident Summary Plan Description</p>
<p><br />************************************************************************<br />Business Travel Accident Insurance Plan</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>The OTS Business Travel Accident Plan (BTA) plan provides benefits in the event death or dismemberment that is the direct result of an accident occurring while traveling on OTS business anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This summary is designed to provide a general easy to read explanation of the Business Travel Accident Plan. The complete provisions of the plan are contained in the official plan document, which governs in case of any differences between it and this summary. This document is maintained in the OTS Human Resources Division in Washington.</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>Coverage under the BTA plan is provided for the following classes of individuals:<br />&bull; All regular full and part time employees working 30 or more hours per week.<br />&bull; Authorized guests and spouses of employees while attending conferences and relocation.<br />&bull; Dependent children of employees in the process of relocation for business purposes only.<br /><br />Effective Date of Coverage<br /><br />The OTS BTA plan becomes effective on the first day of your appointment, provided you are in a pay and duty status on that day. You must be on duty and not on annual or sick leave, excused absence or otherwise absent from duty on the first day of your appointment.<br /><br />You are automatically provided with BTA coverage with no enrollment necessary.<br /><br />Cost<br /><br />BTA coverage is provided by OTS at no cost to you.<br /><br />Coverage Provided<br /><br />The BTA plan provides insurance for covered accidents that result in the loss of life, limbs, speech, hearing or eyesight while you are traveling on official OTS authorized business. Coverage begins when you leave your residence or place of regular employment whichever occurs last, and continues until you return to your residence or place of regular employment, whichever occurs first. Travel between your home and regular place of employment or any personal deviations (an activity that is not reasonably related to business and is not incidental to the business trip) are not covered. If you travel to another city and are expected to remain there for more than 60 days, this shall be deemed a change in permanent assignment.<br />The amount of benefit paid to you or your beneficiary under the BTA plan is based on the extent of accidental injury. Benefits are generally paid to you or your beneficiary in one lump sum. The following benefit will be paid if death results from a covered accident:<br /><br />&bull; Employee $100,000<br />&bull; Authorized guests and spouses $50,000<br />&bull; Each dependent child $10,000<br />&bull; Executives - $250,000<br />&bull; Spouses of Executives - $100,000<br />&bull; Dependent Children of Executives - $25,000<br /><br />The benefit for insureds age 70 74 will be 65 percent; 75 79 will be 45 percent; and 80 84 will be 30 percent of the amounts shown above. The benefit for insureds age 85 and over will be reduced to 15 percent of the amounts shown above.<br /><br />The benefit is paid for accidental death, loss of both feet, both hands or both eyes, loss of one hand and one foot, loss of one hand and one eye, or one foot and one eye; loss of speech and hearing.<br /><br />One-half of the benefit is paid for the loss of one hand, one foot or one eye; loss of speech or hearing.<br /><br />One-fourth of the benefit is paid for the loss of thumb and index finger of the same hand.<br /><br />Benefits are paid for covered loss that results within 365 days of the accident. Loss must be independent of sickness and all other causes. The plan of insurance specifies the benefit and insuring provision applicable to each class of insured. Benefits are payable for an insured's injuries under only one insuring provision for any one accident.<br /><br />The aggregate limit of benefits payable under this plan as the result of the same accident by all insured involved is $5,000,000.00.<br /><br />Beneficiaries<br /><br />Your beneficiary for the death benefit under the BTA plan will automatically be the same as the beneficiary you named for your OTS Group Life Insurance plan. If covered under FEGLI only, your beneficiary will be the same as the beneficiary you named for FEGLI. If no life insurance coverage is elected, the standard federal designation of beneficiary precedence will apply. Dismemberment benefits will be paid to you the insured. You will also be the beneficiary for dependents death benefits.<br /><br />Federal Designation of Beneficiary<br /><br />&bull; To the widow or widower of the employee<br />&bull; To the child or children of the employee and descendants of deceased children by representation<br />&bull; To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee<br />&bull; To other next of kin of the employee entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee at the date of death.<br />War Risk Coverage</p>
<p>Employees are covered for injuries caused by an act of declared or undeclared war while traveling with OTS authorization for business purposes within a war risk country. This coverage includes loss caused by or resulting from war or acts of war worldwide, except for Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia. This coverage does not include the United States and any nation of which the covered person is a citizen.</p>
<p>Hijacking and Air Piracy Coverage</p>
<p>Employees are covered for accidents which are caused by hijacking, air piracy, or any unlawful seizure or attempted seizure of an aircraft, to the extent that this hazard is not covered by then general BTA policy.</p>
<p>Terrorism Coverage</p>
<p>Employees are covered for accident which are caused by an act or acts of terrorism, to the extent that this hazard is not covered by the general BTA policy. Acts of terrorism means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against a non-combatant by persons not acting on behalf or a sovereign state or clandestine state agents.</p>
<p>Additional Travel Security Benefits</p>
<p>Secure Travel is a travel assistance program that is available to all OTS Employees. Employees have access to a network of services designed to give you up to date information every time you embark on a trip.</p>

<DESC><p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

B.1	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
	Accelerating Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II) 
	See Section C for a complete description.


The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery and organization to measurably improve health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will focus on practice-based research to achieve the following 4 objectives:

	Implementation of a proof of concept, through which a previously untested innovation is tested on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified problem (OR: to determine whether it works to solve/address an identified problem);

	Implementation of an innovation or improvement approach*, to provide information for decision-makers about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation will actually work in a given setting;

	Spread, or the taking to scale, of one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements, including the active, wide dissemination of information about what works, accompanied by concrete guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability.  Increasing knowledge about strategies used to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is an important ACTION objective as well. 

	Sustainability, to increase knowledge about the factors that contribute to, or impede, the long term sustainability of innovation.  In particular, we will look to ACTION II to closely examine the experiences and outcomes of ACTION projects that were implemented 3 or more years ago, with a focus on measuring whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained and enhancing understanding of the factors that supported or impeded sustainability.


B.2	TASK ORDERS

	This is a task order requirement for Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II). Services will be acquired on an as-needed basis through issuance of task orders. The minimum total amount to be awarded over the three year base period is plus two (2) year Option Period will be $3,750,000.00. It is anticipated that the maximum total amount for the Base period will be $4,500,000.00 and 3,000,000.00 for the Option Periods. Typical task orders are expected to range between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background

AHRQs mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  Agency funding is growing for research that advances the implementation and dissemination of promising or proven innovations that address the most pressing concerns of those who deliver, manage, pay for, or receive health care services.  AHRQs role in supporting efforts to improve real-world practice and policy has expanded rapidly, in part as a result of the recent emergence of health care reform as one of the most pressing challenges the nation faces.

In 2004, Greenhalgh et al.  completed an extensive review of literature addressing the question how can we spread and sustain innovations in health service delivery and organization? These authors identified several knowledge gaps on which to focus further research, and suggested that the most serious gap must be addressed by answering the question: By what processes are particular innovations implemented and sustained (or not) in particular contexts and settings, and can these processes be enhanced? In 2006, AHRQ launched an initiative titled Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION) that attempted to address many aspects of the gap identified by Greenhalgh et al., and that is the precursor of the current procurement, ACTION II.

ACTION is a five-year task order contract model of practice-based implementation research that includes 15 Partnerships that work under task order contracts.  The Partnerships include a total of over 140 additional collaborating organizations. In total, ACTION Partnerships provide care to more than 100 million people nationwide that represent a broad geographic, demographic and payer mix.  The 15 Partnerships reach across all states and are composed of diverse organizations involved in health care, including: hospital systems; ambulatory care practices; long-term care systems (nursing homes, home health, assisted living); safety net systems; health plans; university schools of medicine, nursing, public health, health policy, and management; health services and outcomes research organizations; Veterans Integrated Delivery System Networks; health care quality assurance organizations, associations of healthcare providers; and consumer advocacy organizations.  Each Partnership contains operational systems that house large, robust, healthcare databases, clinical and research expertise, and the authority to implement health care innovations. A particular focus of ACTION task orders has been on increasing understanding not only of whether a particular innovation works, but on how and why it does or does not work. ACTION represents one of the Agencys most successful efforts to foster public-private collaboration and incorporate best practices into health care delivery, broadly defined (see Definitions below). The period of performance for the current ACTION initiative ends September 30, 2010. For more information about ACTION, including descriptions and funding levels for task orders funded to date, go to www.ahrq.gov/research/ACTION.htm.  

Since ACTION was launched in 2006, calls for additional practice-based research endeavors have increased, and the value of this type of research has been more widely recognized (Shortell et. al, JAMA 2007, Berwick JAMA 2008, Wachter ). Berwick highlighted the need for research methodologies that focus on the local details about how something works and about the what of contexts, rather than removing these details in theoretical pursuit of generalizable knowledge. Berwick noted that it is only by retaining and sharing information about both the mechanisms  and contexts (local conditions that could have influenced the outcomes of interest), that one develops an understanding of the factors that affect generalizability.   Shortell and his colleagues similarly identified the need for increased knowledge about how to put known improvements into routine practice as a key component for improving the quality of care.  Shortell et. al. noted that this integration of content and context seldom happens, and specifically called for the expansion of practice-based research networks such as AHRQs ACTION.   Furthermore, Harvards Steven Spear offered the following guidance and insights from his study of Toyota:  When experimenting with innovations, do not merely ask "what did we accomplish?'" but "what did we learn and how can we put that learning to good use?   Spear has noted that
 
(i)f you manage your work to achieve constant discoverydoing your work with a close eye toward what you don't understand, seeing problems as they occur, solving those problems, converting what you don't understand into something that you do understand, and then putting to use what you now understand and what others don't understandyou could improve and invent more quickly, for longer, and in more areas than anyone else. The key is not importing the answer: it's in importing the robust process by which the great answers are discovered.  
 
Particular interest in research on delivery of care improvement (e.g. process redesign, organizational changes, or financial incentives) has increased since efforts to launch health care reform began in earnest in early 2009.  Nearly one quarter of the priority topics specified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research (http://www.iom.edu/?ID=71025) as meriting more attention are classified in the IOMs broad health care delivery system (HCDS) research area.  This type of research is, of course, particularly well-suited to the interests and capabilities of past and future ACTION researchers.

The current procurement for ACTION II seeks to answer these calls. ACTION II is open to all offerors and will establish an entirely new set of task order contracts. For ACTION II, AHRQ anticipates making awards to between 12 and 15 ACTION II Partnerships that are expected to have many similar characteristics to ACTION Partnerships.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, similarities in task order characteristics are likely to apply as well. There is a high probability of steady or increasing funding for task orders from AHRQ portfolios. In addition, funding may be provided from external sponsors.  Organizations that have funded past task orders include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the DHHS Office of Minority Health/Office of the Secretary, the National Cancer Institute, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  For ACTION II, AHRQ is taking steps to better meet the needs of users, stakeholders and Agency and DHHS goals,  to improve work flow and productivity and to support enhanced communication and collaboration within and among the Partnerships.

Definitions and Frequently Asked Questions

For the purposes of this RFP, the following definitions, some of which have been adapted from Greenhalgh et al., apply: 

Innovation in health care delivery, organization, payment and practice (referred to hereafter as health care delivery): a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness, access to care or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Innovations can either be new to the field of health care delivery or new to a given organization or particular type of setting.

Implementation: active and planned efforts to mainstream an innovation within an organization

Dissemination: active and planned efforts to persuade target groups to adopt an innovation

Sustainability: making an innovation routine until it reaches obsolescence

AHRQ priority populations: children, the elderly, women, individuals affected by low income, who belong to racial/ethnic minorities, who live in rural areas, who are disabled or have special needs

AHRQ target audiences: clinical, health care provider, purchaser/business, policy, and consumer/patient decision-makers

Appendix 1 includes a series of frequently asked questions, based on prior RFPs for implementation research.
 
Objectives

The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery to measurably improve the effectiveness, safety, quality and efficiency of health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will support practice-based research focused on achieving one or more of the following four objectives:
 
	Test or expand investigation of innovations that are new to the health care field, (proofs of concept). Research focused on this objective involves: testing a previously untested innovation on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified health care problem; documenting whether and how well it did or did not work, and why; spreading knowledge generated by this research to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Implement, in additional settings, interventions or improvement approaches that have been demonstrated to have worked in a limited type or number of settings. Research aimed at achieving this objective would generate findings about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation actually works in various settings; and spreading findings to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Spread, or take to scale, one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements.  Activities to achieve this objective would include the active, wide dissemination of one or more innovations that have proven successful in improving health outcomes or on-the-ground care delivery and the provision of guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability of the innovation/s. Identifying and evaluating different strategies for promoting the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is another important component of this objective. Activities to increase spread can take many forms, and can be undertaken by and/or target any key stakeholder groups.   

	Support Sustainability. To achieve this objective, researchers shall: identify and study the factors that contribute to, or impede, the routinization of innovation by appropriate decision-makers and other audiences. In particular, AHRQ will look to ACTION II to closely examine past ACTION (and other) projects to assess whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained, and to learn more about their longer term experiences in trying to sustain their innovations.


ACTION II Characteristics

ACTION II will embody some similar and some new features when compared with ACTION. The principal features of ACTION II include: 

Task Order Master Contract Mechanism: Each ACTION II awardee shall hold a 3-year task order master contract with a 2-year option to extend the contract. Competitive (or justified sole-source) solicitations for task orders will be sent by email to these pre-competed prime contractors throughout each fiscal year.  Each prime contractor shall share these requests for task order (RFTO) with others in its Partnership and decide whether or not to submit one or more task order proposals in response to the RFTO. AHRQ will specify the number of awards anticipated in response to a single RFTO, and the range or ceiling on the cost estimate for each award. Generally, proposals must be submitted within four to eight weeks.  The proposals submitted in response to each RFTO will be reviewed on average within two to three weeks by a committee of approximately five expert reviewers selected among AHRQ staff, co-funders (where applicable), and external experts in the areas critical to the success of the task order. Revisions may be required of one or more top scoring proposals for each anticipated award. Awards will generally be made within two to three weeks of receipt of best and final proposals. 

Topics for Research:  ACTION II is intended to generate and spread knowledge about solutions to current problems in a timely way. ACTION II will thus focus on practical, applied topics of high interest to: the DHHS and AHRQs portfolios (see Appendix 2), the Partners own operational leaders and champions, others making critical decisions and managing change, and other users/stakeholders.  AHRQ intends to use various mechanisms (e.g., Requests for Information, email queries, input from the ACTION II Steering Committee, input from an AHRQ web call for ACTION II concepts) to solicit user input on task order topics and ensure they are feasible, of high priority and ready for implementation or dissemination.  

Broadly speaking, topics will likely include, but will not be limited to: patient safety, health information technology, the structure, organization and coordination of care; payment; quality of care; comparative effectiveness of systems design and change strategies; health care for priority populations; prevention and care management, long-term care, health literacy and emergency preparedness. No health care setting, type of provider, type of recipient, payer or health condition will be excluded from consideration with respect to research topics that may be undertaken under ACTION II, though individual RFTOs are likely to focus on particular types of settings, providers or patients. It is expected that there will be a wide array of topics with substantial diversity within a given topic area. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics that are unknown at the launch of ACTION II may emerge over time. As was noted earlier, task orders will have a particular focus on research designed to increase knowledge about contextual factors that may facilitate or impede implementation, spread and sustainability. 

Nature of the Research: Practice-based research on the development, testing, implementation, spread and sustainability of innovations can take many forms. Some task orders will support the development or preliminary testing (proof-of concept) of package deliverables (e.g., toolkits, curricula, workbooks, guides, models, practice strategies) that address a problem in a new or novel way.  Other task orders may call for the implementation of a proven innovation in sites similar to, and/or different from, those in which it was developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge about the process of implementing innovations and the contextual factors influencing implementation. Still other task orders may focus on the evaluation of different strategies for spreading a proven intervention widely, in order to identify those that are most effective in increasing the systematic and successful adoption and utilization of evidence-based practices. Finally, an additional set of task orders may focus on evaluating whether and to what degree innovations implemented under past ACTION contracts (or other AHRQ initiatives) were sustained, and increasing knowledge about the factors that support or impede sustainability.

Types of Innovations:   As previously defined, innovations are a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Examples of current health care delivery innovations include evidence-based improvement strategies or activities such as Lean, positive deviance, social network analysis, and the implementation of bundled interventions (e.g. Pronovosts Keystone ICU bundle to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections ), bundled payments (e.g. around the Patient Centered Medical Home ) or other innovative financial mechanisms . Future innovations will emerge over the course of the ACTION II period of performance.

ACTION II innovations may be local to national in scope. Some past innovations have spread internationally, although this will not be explicitly envisioned or intended in the development of ACTION II RFTOs. AHRQ will make efforts to select and emphasize project work that is broadly responsive to existing user and stakeholder needs and operational interests, and that has the potential for future dissemination to additional health care settings, providers. payors or recipients of care. While a minority of task orders are expected to focus on large (regional, national) implementation or dissemination projects, Partnerships that have the capacity to take innovations to scale, either on their own or in partnership with others, to spread an innovation will be of special interest to AHRQ. 

Deliverables:  AHRQ and others experience has shown that delivery of a product or package alone to an intended audience is generally insufficient to induce tangible change in care delivery. Those delivering and receiving care often need help in using a new product or approach, particularly if behavior change is required to improve care. ACTION II will thus seek to generate deliverables that maximize the likelihood that research findings and best practices can and will be appropriately utilized by the intended audience/s. Final deliverables may include, but would not be limited to:
	products (e.g. toolkits, workbooks or guides) that provide detailed, practical descriptions of an innovation, explanations of how it is supposed to work and advice for implementing it
	innovative educational or training materials, including curricula for educational/training sessions or workshops (these may be web based)
	provision of support and technical assistance in the adaptation and adoption of a package or process by various new users 
	research findings written for decision-makers
	peer-reviewed and trade journal manuscripts, or final reports suitable for web-posting, summarizing lessons learned

Every deliverable, regardless of its form or content, must be specifically developed for or adapted to the intended audience/s.

Task orders may require the provision of a series of interim deliverables to accelerate delivery of critical findings or better document implementation processes as they unfold. Interim deliverables might include the completion of an environmental scan, the convening of focus groups, technical expert panels or stakeholder meetings, and the development or testing of measures or data bases, interim reports, surveys, or case studies, to name just a few. 

Dissemination: Spreading knowledge generated under task orders is a key component of all four objectives for ACTION II. ACTION II Partnerships may opt to include that capability within their proposed Partnership (by including as members one or more organizations with expertise in dissemination/knowledge transfer), or to subcontract for that expertise on a case-by-case basis, as dictated by the needs or requirements of a specific RFTO. Such expertise should include editing and technical writing, at a minimum.  In addition, AHRQ technical assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing may also be provided (see Appendix 3).   

Rapid Cycle Research: Individual ACTION II task orders must be completed within as short a time frame as feasible. As a frame of reference, ACTION task orders have been completed within 20 months, on average, of the award date. AHRQ expects ACTION II task orders to meet this average timeline of performance.  Exceptions to accelerated task orders may include task orders that require an additional 7-9 months (on average, currently) to meet OMB clearance requirements, and/or task orders that are very large, multifaceted, and require longer periods of data collection.  In AHRQs experience, several factors help accelerate the turn-around time of task orders once awarded.  These factors include, but are not limited to: a focus on topics for which there is a clearly expressed need by a specific intended audience, that are of high current interest to the Partnerships themselves, and for which there is alignment of interest of all parties involved in making the innovation successful; active involvement of champions and operational leaders; and inclusion of individuals in the Partnership who are knowledgeable about, and can readily access and manipulate, needed health care delivery and organizational data.

Sequenced and Bundled Work:  AHRQ may, where appropriate, reduce the current focus on individual task orders and increase the emphasis on a series of task orders or bundled sets of task orders to permit pursuit of topics to their logical and practical ends and take applications to scale. Some of the work to be done under ACTION II will likely be sequenced, with the work of each new phase being dependent on the results of a previous phase. In other cases, a set (bundle) of task orders may be awarded in response to a single RFTO on a topic. It is to be expected that some mix of individual and bundled/serial task orders will be awarded in each year. 

Freedom to Partner with Diverse Organizations or Stakeholder Groups on an As Needed Basis.  Partnerships will be allowed to subcontract with other organizations, as necessary, to meet the needs of a given RFTO.  Partners shall have to decide at the outset which capacities they are likely to need on a continuing basis, and which they may prefer to seek and obtain on a case by case basis to enable them to compete for, and successfully complete, specific task orders throughout the contractual timeline. 

Opportunities for Broad-based Collaboration:  AHRQ expects to encourage more intersections among the ACTION II Partnerships. For example awardees of bundled task orders may wish, or be expected, to share lessons learned with each other as the task orders progress. Depending on the nature of specific task orders, ACTION II Partners many also be encouraged or required to interact with other AHRQ initiatives and programs such as the Health Care Innovations Exchange, the Primary-care Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs), or the HIV Research Network. More information on these and other programs is available at www.ahrq.gov.

Emphasis on Communication and Knowledge Capture: A number of mechanisms will be utilized to support and ensure regular communication between AHRQ and its ACTION II Partners, and among the ACTION II members-- both within and across Partnerships. These will include electronic transmission of progress reports, phone calls, virtual and face-to-face meetings, and the use of a new ACTION II portal. More specifically: 

	ACTION II task order contractors shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQs electronic reporting system. In addition, contractors and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. 

	ACTION II members shall communicate with each other, both within and across Partnerships, through an ACTION II web portal (see Appendix 3) that will be created for this purpose. Tools to support dialogue and collaboration will include web conferencing, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will also serve as an additional avenue for communication between task order officers or ACTION II staff, and contractors. For example, ACTION II staff might use it for teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

	ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository that will be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 

	Representatives of all ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in annual (or perhaps semi annual) face-to-face or virtual meetings. Other meeting participants may include ACTION II Staff, AHRQ Task Order Officers, the AHRQ Contracting Officer, experts in federal requirements, and experts in dissemination. ACTION II members will be expected to help AHRQ staff and ACTION II Steering Committee members shape the agenda for these meetings to assure their relevance to participants needs. Meeting topics may include sharing insights and lessons learned about ACTION II work, new opportunities for collaboration, or strategies developed to meet contractual requirements or overcome common obstacles. 

External Steering Committee: AHRQ expects to convene an External Steering Committee of leading operationally-based experts in healthcare delivery and other stakeholders and champions (including some already involved in advising AHRQ on related topics) to provide direction for ACTION II.  Guidance from the Steering Committee on how best to achieve program goals is intended to supplement that provided by AHRQ Center and Office Directors, portfolio leads and Task Order Officers, and will focus on identifying the most promising opportunities for the program and providing continuous input on strategic planning. The Steering Committee will also serve as an effector arm to help disseminate and promote uptake of ACTION II innovations.
 

Meeting Federal Requirements:  Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. As is further discussed below and in Appendix 3, AHRQ will help ACTION II Partners access technical assistance and other resources to support these efforts.

Support and Technical Assistance for ACTION II Partnerships: AHRQ seeks to help contractors more quickly and efficiently meet specific federal requirements for ACTION II task orders and deliverables (e.g. obtain OMB clearance, meet Section 508 compliance and other web-based product requirements) and enhance dissemination, communication and marketing efforts (see Appendix 3). To this end, AHRQ has arranged to provide support and technical assistance in the above-specified areas to Partnerships, as needed, on a case by case basis for awarded task orders. It is anticipated that some Partnerships already may have some or all required expertise within the project team they propose in response to an RFTO and may not require additional support or technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. Whether the expertise is subcontracted through AHRQ-organized experts or supplied by the team itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs. 

Eligibility Criteria

AHRQ encourages submission of proposals from Partnerships that will represent, in total, expertise that spans a broad array of organizations involved in health care delivery and recipients of care (including AHRQs priority populations). These include, but are not limited to health services research organizations; health care delivery systems and organizations (inpatient, ambulatory and long-term care); health plans; academic health centers, research consulting firms; Quality Improvement Organizations; Veterans Administration sites and other governmental organizations; employers or employer coalitions; state and local government health care agencies; community-based collaboratives to improve health care, consumer advocacy groups, and other organizations that work at the national, state or regional level to promote or leverage evidence-based innovation in health care delivery.  Given trends in recent funding and priority topics, AHRQ is particularly interested in Partnerships that center on, or include, substantial numbers of primary care providers interested in participating in ACTION II implementation research. It is important to note that the range of settings/providers included in any specific partnership will not be a scoring criteria; AHRQ hopes to achieve overall diversity across the network of partnerships selected for awards.   

There are no restrictions or requirements regarding the number or types of organizations that should be included in a Partnership, and there are many different models that Partnerships may consider in configuring themselves, including but not limited to the following examples:
	A Partnership may wish to focus on a particular type of provider/care setting/access organization. An example might be a Partnership of primary care practice-based research networks (PBRNS). Other examples might includes hospital systems, long-term care facilities, safety net delivery systems, or health plans that the Partnership would enlist to represent a diverse group of that type of organization; 
	A Partnership may wish to enlist participation from a broad group of stakeholders who span the full range of settings within which care is delivered to a specific priority population (e.g., children, the elderly, the underserved);
	A Partnership may wish to focus on achieving change through a particular type of innovation (e.g., payment) and enlist the participation of interested providers, health plans, and public and private payers 
	A Partnership may be a multi-stakeholder collaborative, composed of plans, providers, payer and consumers from a given geographic region
	A Partnership may be composed of safety net providers who serve multiple priority populations 

The Partnerships proposal must describe how specific characteristics of each participating member organization shall contribute to meeting ACTION IIs objectives.
 
NOTE: The lead, or prime, offeror in a Partnership submitting a proposal may be a not-for-profit or for-profit organization. While primes cannot be included in any other submission, non-prime collaborators may be included in more than one Partnership.  

ACTION II Performance Requirements

To successfully complete task orders that achieve the goals and objectives of the ACTION II program, ACTION II Partnerships must meet the following requirements: 

Requirement #1:  Understand and conform to the requirements of the Task Order Master Contract Mechanism. ACTION II Partnerships must be familiar with federal task order contract mechanisms and must be prepared to adhere to the requirements of the master contract signed by the lead Partner. While this point seems obvious, past experience has shown some misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of the signed task order contract by the lead contractor organization or the subcontractors on a given task order.  Task order contracts differ substantially from grants. For example: task orders must conform strictly to the scope of work for which the task order is awarded unless a modification is agreed to in advance by appropriate AHRQ staff; deliverables must be submitted on time and their quality must be approved by AHRQ staff;  deliverables must be approved by AHRQ staff prior to publication or presentation; invoices for hours worked during the invoice period must be submitted regularly and must include all required details; payment is conditional on submission of invoices and task order officer approval of the quality of the work performed; work conducted past the end date of the task order period of performance will not be reimbursed; and OMB clearance is required for collection of certain types and amounts of data. Partnerships that can demonstrate a track record of successful task order contract work, and/or have a clear understanding of, and willingness to conform to, contractual requirements will be preferred.  

Requirement # 2:  Understand and be committed to the benefits and purposes of practice-based implementation research generally, and of ACTION goals and objectives more specifically. ACTION II Partnerships must have a keen awareness of where their research might, and should, be applied in practice.  As has already been noted, but bears repeating, AHRQ is particularly interested in process: how implementation and dissemination of innovations works (or why it does not work). In cases where real-time learning is occurring, it will be important to capture sufficient information on the process itself to allow other health care delivery systems, organizations, and practitioners to adapt (or avoid) the innovation for their own use.  There must be sufficient scrutiny and documentation of processes to assure that others can gain from the experience of the task order team.

In preparing proposals in response to RFTOs, Partners should address questions such as:  
a.	Who are the end users who will apply the innovation in practice?
b.	What barriers or obstacles need to be addressed and overcome? What facilitators can be engaged? 
c.	Which implementation partners can help involve the most appropriate users? 
d.	Which dissemination partners can help reach additional appropriate users? 
e.	How can the research outcomes best be communicated to the intended audiences? 
f.	What is the best way to evaluate how the innovation works and if it will be sustainable? 

Requirement #3: Enlist the committed, continuing participation of organizations whose missions and capacities enable them to successfully complete task orders serving one or more of the four ACTION objectives for practice-based research (see Objectives).

AHRQ seeks involvement of: diverse providers and provider and system sites; providers of all levels of care that serve underserved populations; public and private payers interested in working with providers to achieve large scale and sustained innovation; organizations representing consumers/recipients of care; organizations with large data bases; researchers with clinical, organizational, measurement and other interests and expertise in health care delivery. Since the goal of ACTION II is to accelerate the development, implementation and sustainability of evidence-based innovations to improve health delivery, AHRQ has an obvious interest in including providers who have a track record of being innovators, early adopters, change agents or otherwise at the cutting edge of developing or implementing innovation. However, AHRQ believes that it is equally important that ACTION II include organizations that are broadly representative of the full spectrum of providers in terms of their past experience with implementing innovation or their capacity to do so.

Requirement #4:  Perform high quality, practice-based implementation research. Partnerships will be expected to demonstrate research capacity and experience with all facets of practice-based implementation research, as described above.  Such research shall of necessity center on a broad range of health care settings, providers, recipients of care, payers, and possibly on particular health conditions and will be expected to span diverse demographic, payer and geographic mixes. Multi-method research will often, if not always, be required. This will in turn require collaborations among well-recognized researchers, clinicians and others with expertise and experience in the full range of implementation research methods ( including both qualitative and quantitative methods); in manipulating large, robust databases (particularly electronic databases); in evidence-based management; and in a wide range of substantive clinical and organizational/management issue areas.  Finally, an ability to properly perform the desired research will require access to data bases whose size, scope and specificity are well-aligned with the research questions they are expected to help answer.

Requirement #5: Be prepared to enlist the participation of additional organizations in response to emergent needs and opportunities. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics and opportunities may emerge over time. Thus, Partnerships must be able to flexibly respond to new and unanticipated topics and opportunities. This flexibility is likely to result from a combination of the existing capacities of the Partnership and its member organizations, as well as from an ability to nimbly expand and change over time to accommodate new challenges and opportunities as they arise. As was noted earlier, AHRQ also expects to encourage more intersections with other initiatives and programs within or external to AHRQ.

Requirement #6: Perform research that supports AHRQs research priorities as reflected in its portfolios. Generally, funding for ACTION II task orders will come from one or more of AHRQs portfolios. The subjects of these task orders will thus reflect the research interests and objectives of the portfolios (see Appendix 2). The composition and capacities of ACTION II Partnerships should be shaped by a desire to serve these interests and objectives. 

Requirement #7:  Target priority populations. AHRQ seeks to include ACTION II Partnerships that serve large numbers of one or more priority populations (see Definitions). Because of the importance of this requirement, offerors are required to complete a matrix that provides information on the characteristics of the Partnerships recipients of care (Appendix 4.

Requirement #8: Engage and involve operational and quality improvement leaders.  AHRQ will expect to see evidence of strong commitment from operational and quality improvement leaders and champions of innovation, learning and change within ACTION IIs Partnerships.  Champions and leaders are expected to actively support healthcare delivery and organization improvement (e.g., making efforts to encourage the adoption of best practices, where promising, within and beyond their organizations). 

Requirement #9: Understand and meet the needs of AHRQ target audiences. Understanding and serving the needs of AHRQs multiple target audiences (see Definitions) is a central requirement of ACTION II. While no single Partnership is expected to represent or include every one of these audiences, AHRQ intends to ensure that all of these audiences will be well represented within the ACTION II network. Offerors will thus be asked to provide information on the basic characteristics of their Partnerships participants and any additional audiences the Partnership is in a position to reach and influence (Appendices 4 and 5). 

Requirement #10:  Identify and utilize communications and dissemination vehicles, methods and mechanisms that will maximize the likelihood of broad and meaningful translation of research into practice.  Dissemination of findings or products will be a key requirement of every ACTION II RFTO. Partnerships will have the option of demonstrating expertise and experience within their teams of what is variously referred to as knowledge transfer and exchange, knowledge communication, knowledge translation. Alternatively, Partnerships may wish to subcontract out the dissemination/knowledge translation functions on a case by case basis for individual task orders.  For some task order deliverables considered to be particularly important, additional assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing will be provided by AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (see Appendix 3).   

Requirement #11:  Manage complex research projects and coordinate widely varying activities across multiple, diverse sites and actors. Each Partnership will be required to designate a point person or small team located within the lead Partner organization to assume responsibility for: meeting ACTION II contract requirements (including the federal requirements described above); coordinating tasks and activities within the Partnership; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff throughout the period of performance of the ACTION II master contract. This point of contact or team will be expected to develop and maintain a solid working relationship with AHRQ staff affiliated with ACTION II (Task Order Officers, Contracting Officer, Program Officer, Support and Technical Assistance staff, if needed) and shall be responsible for maintaining current information on Partnership activities, participants and task order progress and deliverables on the ACTION II portal. Every technical proposal submitted in response to an RFTO must include information on who shall perform this role and how these needs shall be met; cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours and costs. 

Requirement #12: Comply with federal requirements. As noted above, completion of task orders shall generally require compliance with one or more federal laws or regulations, such as those associated with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. In addition, all deliverables must adhere to AHRQ publishing guidelines. As detailed in Requirement #11, an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization must ensure that all federal requirements are met and coordinate all activities associated with doing so.

Requirement #13:  Work on an accelerated basis. Partnerships must have the organizational expertise, experience and willingness to conduct and complete task orders within as short a time frame as feasible. As was noted above, on average task orders not requiring OMB clearance will have periods of performance of approximately 20 months (range: 18-30 months). 

Requirement #14:  Meet deadlines: ACTION II contractors shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables. For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

Requirement #15:  Engage in knowledge sharing activities within and across Partnerships. Representatives from ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in an annual face-to-face invitational meeting and periodic phone conferences and webinars. In addition, Partnerships and their members will be expected to be active users of the ACTION web portal described above (see Appendix 3).  For example, the prime Partner will be expected to help supply data for the knowledge repository and to maintain up-to-date contact information and profiles of its member organizations. ACTION Partnerships will be encouraged to avail themselves of portal collaboration tools such as web conferences, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. 

In-Kind resources: A Partnerships commitment to a project increases when that project reflects the organizations own goals for, and investments in, quality improvement. While it is not a requirement, a willingness to commit in kind or other resources, if possible and appropriate for future task orders, is desirable. Most Partnerships will end up volunteering some staff time to ACTION II task orders. Such contributions are difficult to predict and quantify, and may depend on the type of organization involved.  However, AHRQ wants to both acknowledge such contributions and more accurately gauge the level and type of commitment provided by Partnerships. For these reasons, in kind resources should be accounted for by Partnerships in ACTION II proposals for specific future task orders, if and when they arise.

Guidelines/Instructions for Demonstrating Ability to Meet Performance Requirements 

The Agency seeks Partnerships that are capable of successfully completing task orders designed to achieve the ACTION II goals and objectives described above. Offerors should complete the Proposal Requirements Table in Appendix 6, which mirrors the Requirements in the section above and the guidelines/instructions provided below.  Completion of Appendix 6 will help ensure that all proposal requirements are addressed.  In addition this table will assist proposal reviewers with their reviews. 

To demonstrate necessary capacities and capabilities, prospective Partnerships must:

1.	Exhibit a clear understanding of the task order contracting mechanism and how it differs from the grant mechanism. Offerors should identify potential challenges and benefits to themselves and to AHRQ arising from use of this mechanism and describe how challenges may be managed or resolved. Offerors should provide evidence of past experience in working as contractors and, where possible, draw on this experience in identifying challenges and benefits of contractual relationships. 
2.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of, and commitment to, practice-based implementation research; provide evidence of a proven track record in this area.
3.	Describe the reason/s for including each of the proposed partnering organizations, highlighting their specific capacities and expected contributions.

As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use  Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1) (A) and (1) (B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b) (1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1) (C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1) (C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	The Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(3)	If the AHRQ COTR does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However, the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. 

(d)  Copyright  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c) (1) (i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Governments stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2	 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.  

H.3	SUBCONTRACTS

The contractor must include in any subcontracts executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract the terms of requirements H.1, H.2, H.4, H.5, H.6, H.7, H.10, H.11 and H.13.  These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause may be included to diminish these requirements.

Award of any subcontract is subject to the written approval of the Contracting Officer upon review of the supporting documentation as required by FAR Clause 52.215-12, Subcontractor Cost or Pricing Data, of the General Clauses incorporated into this contract.  A copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.

	a.	The basis of indebtedness.

	b.	The amount due.

	c.	The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.

You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she can be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract closeout is completed and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.

H.6  	SALARY RATE LIMITATION

Pursuant to the applicable Public Law cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts.  However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants.  If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

H.9	PROTEST

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a Task Order under this contract except on grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.

H.10	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

3.	Protection of sensitive information.  The Contractor shall ensure that sensitive information is protected by information security and privacy controls commensurate with the risk associated with the potential loss or compromise of this information.  For purposes of this contract, information is sensitive if the loss of confidentiality or integrity could be expected to have a serious, severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.   Further, the loss of sensitive information confidentiality or integrity could: (i) cause a significant or severe degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is unable to perform its primary functions or the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant or major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant or major financial loss; or (iv) result in significant, severe or catastrophic harm to individuals.

Personally identifiable information (PII) is a subset of sensitive information and is defined as data which can potentially be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual, or potentially reveal the activities, characteristics, or other details about a person.   PII shall receive a level of protection commensurate with the risk associated with the loss or compromise of sensitive information.

4.	Sensitive information on public systems.  The Contractor shall ensure that sensitive information is not stored, processed or transmitted on a publicly-available system (via the Internet) without the appropriate controls in place and specific authorization from the AHRQ Chief Information Officer (CIO).  

5.	Privacy requirements.  The Contractor shall conduct and maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) as defined by Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52-239-1, and required by HHS policy.  The PIA shall be completed in accordance with HHS PIA guidance.  Periodic reviews shall be conducted to determine if a major change to the system has occurred, and if a PIA update is subsequently required.  If it is determined that an update is necessary, the Contractor shall make the necessary changes to the PIA.

The Contractor shall abide by all requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and FAR Clause 52-239-1.  Pursuant to those requirements, the Contractor shall create and publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) in the Federal Register when required and shall publish an updated SORN following a major change to the system, as directed by OMB Memorandum (M) 03-22, OMB Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, or subsequent replacement guidance.

6.	System accreditation.  The Contractor shall certify and accredit all systems in conformance with the standards set forth by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, prior to the system becoming operational.  This activity shall be performed in conjunction with the initial development of the system, updated when a major change occurs to the system, and renewed no less than every three years.  All system certification and accreditation (C&A) packages shall be compliant with all Public Law (PL)-107-347, OMB mandates, FIPS, and additional applicable NIST guidance.  This guidance includes, but is not limited to FIPS 199, FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-18, NIST SP 800-30, NIST SP 800-37, NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-53A, and NIST SP 800-60.  All NIST and FIPS documentation can be found at the NIST website. 

HHS has created a C&A checklist to facilitate compliance with the OMB-mandated C&A process.  The HHS C&A Checklist will be provided upon contract initiation.  Prior to becoming operational, all systems must receive a signed Authorization to Operate (ATO) issued by the agency Designated Authorization Authority (DAA).  No system will be permitted into the production environment without a valid, signed ATO.

7.	Annual requirements.  The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting ongoing information security and privacy system requirements.  These include, but are not limited to, performing annual system testing, completing an annual system self-assessment, and supporting quarterly and annual AHRQ FISMA reporting.  Additionally, AHRQ reserves the right to test or review the system security and privacy controls at any time.

8.	Security and privacy training.  All Contractors shall receive general awareness training and role-based training, commensurate with the responsibilities required to perform the work articulated in the terms and conditions of the Contract.
	
	The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring each contractor employee has completed the AHRQ Security Awareness Training as required by the agency prior to performing any contract work or accessing any system, and on an annual basis thereafter, throughout the period of performance of the contract.  The Contractor shall maintain a list of all individuals who have completed this training and shall submit this list to the COTR upon request.  As a part of this training, the Contractor shall ensure that all staff read, agree to, and sign the HHS Rules of Behavior.
	
The Contractor shall ensure that all contractors with significant security responsibilities, as defined by HHS, receive commensurate role-based training.  As stated in the Secure One HHS Memorandum, Role-Based Training (RBT) of Personnel with Significant Security Responsibilities, significant security responsibilities are defined as the responsibilities associated with a given role or position, which, upon execution, could have the potential to adversely impact the security posture of one or more HHS systems.   The Contractor shall maintain a list of all individuals that possess significant security responsibilities and the subsequent role-based training courses completed, and shall submit this list to the COTR upon request.  
	
9.	Electronic communication.  All Contractor staff that have access to and use of HHS electronic mail (e-mail) must identify themselves as contractors on all outgoing e-mail messages, including those sent in reply or forwarded to another user.  The Contractor shall ensure all contractor staff embed an e-mail signature ("AutoSignature") or an electronic business card ("V-card") within each electronic correspondence to automatically display "Contractor" in the signature.

10.	Clearances.  The Contractor shall ensure all staff has the required level of security clearance commensurate with the sensitivity of the information being stored, processed, transmitted or otherwise handled by the System or required to perform the work stipulated by the contract.  At the minimum, all Contractor staff shall be subjected to a Public Trust background check and be granted a Public Trust clearance before access to the System or other HHS resources is granted.

H.13	AHRQ APPLICATION AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC).  This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases:

	Concept 
	Initiation
	Planning
	Requirements Analysis
	Design
	Development
	Testing
	Implementation / Deployment
	Operations and Maintenance
	Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects.   The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology.  The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by ARHQ.  The Rational ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. 

Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractors SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section.  It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain COTR approval before moving from one phase to another. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires  and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. 

The following table describes the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation 
The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the COTR for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agencys Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, Documentation Deliverables, are required by AHRQ. 
Project Initiation Document 

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COTR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID is satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.  

 
Project Work Plan

The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.  

System Requirements Document

The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

	Requirement ID, Name and Title
	Requirement Description
	Software Release Version
	Use Case Model
	Use Case Specifications
	Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.
Requirements Traceability Matrix

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the beginning of a projects lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements.  

The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation.  

The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

	Requirement ID and Title;
	The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;
	The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;
	The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;
	The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; 
	The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.

The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a projects life cycle.

 

System Design Document
The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.  

The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.

The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries. 

Test Plan
The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:
A.	Test Description 
	A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system. 
	Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit). 
	Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort. 
	A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process. 
B.	Acceptance Criteria

	Pass/Fail Criteria
	Actual Results
	Comments

User Acceptance Test Report
The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report should include a summary of the testing environment (hardware, software, tools, participant list, etc.) and procedures used to demonstrate and obtain stakeholder approval of the application or system prior to production deployment. The UAT Report should contain a mapping to the SRD and SDD items included in the release as well as an exception list or identified change requests that were generated as the result of testing. 

User Guide
The User Guide is completed prior to production.  The User Guide is a How To manual which navigates the user in detail through the use of the application.  This document usually contains system screen shots and provides step by step instructions for completing tasks and activities.  It is written on a business level with the needs of the user in mind.  At a minimum the document should contain the following content.
	Introduction

	Recovery Instructions - Describe the steps required to reconstruct the release from the product baselines, established in the configuration management library.

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines 
 
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources.  

Guidelines for Web-Based Products
 
Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum requirements:
 



Titles of Products

Coordinate with your COTR on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word counteliminate initial articles such as The or A ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products.

Quality Control/Editorial Review

This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style.  This should be done by the AHRQ grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.
 
Intellectual Property Rights

Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions:

	Who retains the copyright?
	Who has licenses for what purposes and uses?
	What are the constraints imposed?
	Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability 

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html

Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release.
 
Privacy Act Protections

Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools. Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 
Guidelines for Web Sites
 
Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws, policies, and directives that affect such resources. 

This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources. 

For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to:  http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml

Clearance 

Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate departmental clearance. 

Domain Names 

All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by FirstGov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The FirstGov link is then required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests. 

Editorial Review

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility 

Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov

Privacy

A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected.  Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. 

Web Site Mailbox

Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. 

Records Management

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to:
http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html

Information Collection Budget

If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection.  

 
Intellectual Property

Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue. 

Linking

External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of a specific commercial product or service. 

Electronic FOIA

The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site. 

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. Go to http://www.usability.gov as a reference for best practices in initial development or redesign of Web resources. 

Web Sponsor Identity

AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a consistent look and feel of Web resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are:
 
	Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov).
	Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal.
	HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web site. 
	Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.

H. 14	TASK ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES

All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs) signed by the Contracting Officer and accepted by the Contractor.  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.    

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

Each Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of one task order during the 3-year base contract. The minimum dollar amount guaranteed per Contractor is $25,000.  The purpose of this task order is to provide for general management and administrative work that is not directly attributable to a particular task order topic.  Services requested under this task order will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuance of specific work assignments, as directed by the Task Order Officer (TOO).

1)	Travel to AHRQ or other locations for meetings concerning ACTION II as directed by the TOO. These funds are not to be used for meetings relating to a specific task order, but rather for the purpose of the overall initiative.
2)	Miscellaneous work associated with the general management and administration of this task order and other assignments as determined by the TOO.
It is expected that TOs will average between $250,000 and $750,000 and last between eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being twelve months.  There may be circumstances where the amount and duration of task orders exceed these average amounts.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

	Procedures for Issuance of TOs

	1.	Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each TO.  Factors such as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost control, price, cost, or other factors that the Contracting Officer believes are relevant to the placement of orders will be considered.

	2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee.

	3.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on cost, technical merit, and any other relevant factors.

4.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

		E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $2500.

	5.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

	6.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the fixed maximum labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

	7.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

8.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

	9.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

	10.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

11.	Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily electronically through e-mail or internet but they can also be issued by facsimile or mail.  Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities.  When a RFTO is issued, the Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost/price information for performing the required services.  Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 

K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

(c)	The Contractor shall include this clause in every subcontract and purchase order that is subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this contract.

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

(ii)	(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --

(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.

(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.9	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction

The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  Special attention is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions:     
         
	a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that a cost-reimbursement, task order type contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.  To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

		I.	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.

II.	PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.11) 

III.	SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN: See Small Disadvantaged Business Plan Instructions for format (L.12)   FOR INFORMATION ONLY

IV.	BUSINESS PROPOSAL:  See Business Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.13).

	c.	Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 3 parts:  

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; and (3) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The four factors are: scientific technical merit, cost, past performance.  The scientific technical merit of the proposals will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor(s) for this acquisition.  Offerors that submit technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated for past performance. Following these evaluations a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all. 


THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION

The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.

The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to evaluation criteria 1 through 3 (including subcriteria). The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the evaluation of each criteria below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation:


OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE: Evaluation Criteria 1 through 3, for  a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a peer review technical committee that will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal. Program staff and contracting personnel will review and evaluate Criteria 4 for a total of 25 points. The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria 1 though 4 are 125 points.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  SUBCONTRACT, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBAs PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _30__% for small business (SB), _11_% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _3__% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ___5__% for women-owned business (WOSB), __3__% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the following goals, at a minimum, _____% for small business, ____% small disadvantaged business, ____% for HubZone businesses, ______% for   woman owned businesses, and ______% for veteran-owned businesses.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal. 

NOTE TO CONTRACTORS:  Please provide your CCS number with your Dun & Bradstreet number.

_____ Commercial products/service plan  This plan is used when the contractor sells products and services customarily used for non-government purposes.

8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your subcontracts with small business concerns, HubZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns.

Your company has established and uses such procedures:  ________  yes  _________  no

9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, HubZone small, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.

APPENDIX 1

Frequently Asked Questions

A. Questions on Composition of Partnerships

1) Please define an "offeror"?  Is the entire partnership considered to be an "offeror" or is only one of the partners an offeror and others are subcontractors/collaborators?

From AHRQs perspective, offeror refers primarily to the partnership as a whole. The participants in the partnership consist of the prime, or lead, organization with which AHRQ will contract, and its subcontractors/collaborators.
 
2) Can a subcontractors/collaborator organization participate on two separate proposals from two different offerors?

Yes, an organization can collaborate with more than one prime (i.e., the lead organization) in a partnership. 

3) Would it be permissible for ACTION II to fund partnerships that include organizations based outside the United States?

AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. In order to meet ACTION IIs objectives and to assist in meeting AHRQ's mission, this program is expected to attract and consider offers from US-based healthcare delivery systems that serve US populations and have access to US healthcare system data. 

B. Questions on Process

4) Will ACTION II contract awardees be awarded any funds immediately, or do partnership awardees constitute a "pool" from which AHRQ will develop and solicit proposals for contract task orders at future dates? 

Each prime awardee will receive an initial task order for $25,000 to help defray the cost of travel to occasional ACTION II meetings for partnership representatives, and other miscellaneous administrative tasks. Aside from this initial task order, AHRQ will indeed develop Requests for Task Order at future dates and solicit proposals from ACTION II partnerships. 

5)  Are partnerships to include ideas for task orders in their responses to the ACTION II RFP, or are they simply applying for a contract to become an ACTION contract awardee?  

Ideas for task orders are not requested and should not be included in the proposal.

6) Will the ACTION partnerships participate in the development of future potential tasks and requests for task order?

Yes, submission of 1-2 page concepts for Requests for Task Order is anticipated to be encouraged from all sources:  the ACTION partnerships, AHRQ staff, co-funding organizations, HHS, and others.  The Requests for Task Order themselves are generally developed by AHRQ staff.  Staff from co-funding organizations will also be involved in this process if co-funding is obtained. 

C. Questions on Past Performance

7) If past performance of the organizations involved is in terms of research grants (e.g. NIH RO1 type and foundations), rather than contracts, how will this record be evaluated? Are these organizations at a disadvantage if they do not have past contract experience?

Past performance evaluations on relevant contracts are preferred because they show the offerors performance on quality, cost control, timeliness and business relations.  If an offeror does not have relevant past performance evaluations on contracts, past performance evaluations on relevant grants will be considered.

8) Is past performance information required from all individual organizations within the partnership?

Past performance of the partnership as an entity is highly desirable. However, if the partnership is entirely new or includes new collaborators, past performance of individual collaborating organizations should be included. Please note that if an organization has a proposed subcontractor submitting a Past Performance evaluation form on this procurement, the name of the Prime Contractor should be included in order to be evaluated as part of the correct partnership.

9) If collaborators in a partnership have held federal contracts, and their performance on those contracts is relevant to the partnership's ability to demonstrate past performance quality, may these be included in the past performance evaluations?

Yes

10) It is the responsibility of the partnerships to ensure that their past performance evaluations are completed and forwarded on time directly to AHRQ by the contracting organizations listed in the Past Performance submission.  Can partnerships ask the contracting organizations to cc them on their responses to ensure that AHRQ has been sent the evaluations and that they should have been received on time?

Past performance evaluations are to be completed confidentially; offerors may not see the evaluations being submitted. Partnerships should emphasize to their evaluation contract organizations that evaluations must be received on time. Only those evaluations received by the date specified in the solicitation will be considered.  

11) How should relevant projects that have been funded internally by a health care provider as part of its operations or research and development be handled?  Should such projects be included in the organizational and corporate experience section of the technical proposal but not in the past performance section, since there are no external funders/clients to complete the past performance questionnaire and contractor performance form?

Yes, past performance evaluations should only be requested from external customers.
12) How many projects should be evaluated for the partnership as a whole? Does the number of evaluations vary with the size of the partnership?
Five relevant projects total should suffice unless the partnership is very large, in which case a few more examples could be added. 
D. Questions on Labor Categories and Rates

13) Although the RFP states that contractors shall be reimbursed for costs incurred for labor based on hourly rates, no rates are listed.  Is the offeror to provide the Proposed Labor Rates for each of the Years listed?

Yes, the offeror is to propose the Proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Ranges, for each of the Years listed for each of the six labor categories. The cost analysis will consist of establishing a Labor Category Hourly Rate Range for the six Labor Categories (I, II, III, IV, V and VI). 

14)  With regard to the presentation of labor rates by class level and year, would it be sufficient to provide a range, established on the basis of a sample of rates, within which we intend to stay?  Also, is there a specific inflation factor that should be used to show these labor rates in the out years or is the commonly used 3-4% acceptable?
 
A representative sample of positions that could be averaged to propose each Labor Category Hourly Rate Range per class is requested. The negotiations for the proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Range will include the evaluation of the reasonableness of the individual cost components (unburdened rate, indirect rates and fee/ profit, if applicable.)  The recommended labor escalation rate for future Government Fiscal Years should be approximately 3%. 

15) Is certified documentation of an indirect rate agreement approved for federal awards only necessary for the prime organization or for the other participants in the partnership as well?

It is required for the prime organization and each participant in the partnership as well If an indirect rate is not established by the time of contract award, the organization will be provided up to 90 days to establish the indirect cost rate.  

E. Questions on Participant Characteristics and Key Personnel

16) From the table in Appendix 4 it appears that some partner organizations should be providers/insurers.  In the section on partnership eligibility however, the list of organizations eligible to be included is much broader.  Please clarify.  Should Appendix 4 be completed for each partner organization or should it be a summary of all partner organizations including the offeror?

The table in Appendix 4 serves the purpose of very roughly summarizing for reviewers some characteristics of any participating organizations for which the named characteristics apply , particularly those serving patients, residents or health plan enrollees. Offerors are encouraged to present these characteristics either for the partnership as a whole or for individual participants in the partnership. AHRQs preference would be to report by organization, if feasible. Offerors are also encouraged to present, in similar table format, any desired complementary information (e.g., number of employers in a coalition and the employer characteristics.)   

17) Can the key personnel include people from each of the partner organizations?  Can major subcontractors be key personnel?  Should it be assumed that each partner organization has a key person tied to it?

Yes, key personnel may include persons from collaborating organizations as well as the prime organization. It is correct to assume that each collaborating organization should have a designated main contact. 

18) If the chart in Appendix 4 that documents delivery system settings and providers does not fit the offeror partnerships model of health care delivery. may an offeror redesign this table in order to document the types of services provided by its programs in the way which best reflects program reality? 

Feel free to add information in a separate table that may better reflect the components of the partnership in question. 

F. Questions on Small and Disadvantaged Businesses
19) Could AHRQ clarify the similarities and differences between a Small Business Subcontracting Plan and a Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan?   Could AHRQ clarify which of these two Plans should be addressed when an awardee responds to a task order?  
The requirement for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and the Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be required only for task orders in excess of $500,000. The purpose of the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (FAR 19.704  )is to  provide information as to how an offeror plans to meet the DHHS/ AHRQ (departmental) goals for socioeconomic contracting for the instant procurement (particular task order in this case).   The Small Business Subcontract Plan will be negotiated on an as needed basis.   

The Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan (FAR 19.12) is a plan that provides information on how the organization as a whole has subcontracted with disadvantaged businesses in the past and how it plans to do so in the future.

20)  While the offeror realizes that no formal Subcontracting Plan or Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan is required with the initial proposal submission, and is only required at the Request for Task Order level, please clarify the SBA requirements that a prime contractor's small business percentages are derived from the total planned subcontract amount on Task Order proposals, not a percentage of the total Task Order value. 
 
The small business percentages would be derived from the total planned subcontract amount on the Task Order proposal.  Note the Task Order proposal amount may change as a result of negotiation. 

21) The RFP indicates that a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be requested if a future Task Order meets or exceeds the $500,000 threshold.  Could AHRQ clarify whether a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan should be included in the current proposal response to this RFP and if so, is this applicable both to the prime and to major subcontractors (if any of them are not small businesses)?  Is there any added value for including Small Disadvantaged Business Participation plan in the current proposal application?   

The proposal is not required to include either a Small Business Subcontracting Plan or a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan in order to be responsive to the RFP.  The submission of a Small Business Participation Plan with the proposal would add no value to the proposal. 

G. Question on Review Committee

22) Will there be any non-academically affiliated health care provider organizations represented on the ACTION II proposal review committee? 

AHRQs statute requires that all contract proposals are peer reviewed by reviewers who do not have a conflict of interest with any of the offerors participating organizations.  Reviewers names remain confidential and are not be released even through the Freedom of Information Act in order to ensure an impartial evaluation. AHRQ appreciates your suggestion.
 
H. Question on Proposal Delivery to AHRQ 

23) Please indicate whether other express mail services (such as UPS or Federal Express) may be used to deliver the proposal AHRQs Rockville, Maryland address and if there are security restrictions that would delay timely receipt of a proposal using express or other mail services.  

The offeror may use any express mail carrier it chooses. The offeror assumes responsibility for that choice (i.e., an error or delay encountered by the express carrier is the responsibility of the offeror).  Please be cautioned that security restrictions at AHRQ may delay timely receipt of a proposal.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure the proposal arrives on or before the deadline. Also be cautioned that a proposal missing any required components (e.g., insufficient number of copies) will not be accepted.






















APPENDIX 2

AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market ACTION II research products and findings resulting from ACTION II task orders. 

                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makersincluding patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakerswith up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management. 





















APPENDIX 3 

SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ACTION PARTNERSHIPS


NEED TO ADD SOMETHING HERE REFERRING TO THE ININTIAL TASK ORDER FOR +/- $25 K FOR TRAVEL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRIME COORDINATING FUNCTION.

ACTION II Portal

AHRQ will develop and maintain an ACTION II portal to enhance collaborative efforts for all ACTION partnerships. The portal will include tools to support dialogue and collaboration, such as web conferencing capability, provision of collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will serve as an avenue for communication between Task Order Officers or other ACTION II staff, and contractors. The portal may be used to host teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

ACTION II Partnerships will play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository to be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 
, for example: contact information for partnership members, profiles for each of these members, a library of ACTION II-related templates and examples of documents, relevant published literature, and a calendar of events of interest.  

AHRQ will provide technical staff to operate and maintain portal software applications. The portal will maximize security and data privacy. 

Technical Assistance

On a case by case basis, technical assistance will be available to ACTION II Partnerships for:
1.	OMB clearance package development 
2.	Adherence to 508 compliance and web product requirements for all electronic deliverables
3.	Dissemination, communication and marketing for selected deliverables intended for public release


1.	OMB Clearance Package Development  

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance is an outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It was designed to minimize the burden that data collection activities might have on the public and to ensure the quality and utility of the information collected. OMB clearance is used interchangeably with ICR Clearance (Information Collection Request Clearance) or PRA Clearance (Paperwork Reduction Act Clearance). 

OMB Clearance is needed for all federal contract research if any data collection activities involve ten or more respondents for whom the questions are standardized in nature. This includes any instances where an interview schedule composed of a set of core questions will be used for 10 or more subjects, even if it is modified for subgroups of nine or fewer interviewees (e.g. doctors vs. nurses, managers vs. front-line employees). These data collection activities include research project surveys, interviews, questionnaires, epidemiology studies, health risk factor assessments, and evaluations. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Clearance and OMB Clearance are two separate clearances. Having one of the two clearances does not negate the need for the other. 

The normal OMB Clearance process currently takes approximately 7-9 months from beginning to end.  More details about the timeline are available at http://www.os.dhhs.gov/ocio/policy/collection/infocollectiontimeline.html.  An OMB Clearance Package includes a number of documents and processes. These include:

a.  83-I: A Form that provides a listing of the information required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of which copies are submitted with each package to be reviewed by OMB.  
b.  Supporting Statement:  The supporting statement consists of two parts and follows a standard format.  Section A provides the justification for the proposed data collection activity and Section B outlines the statistical methods and design. The supporting statement is generally prepared by the group contracted to conduct the research on behalf of AHRQ.

c. Attachments: Any additional materials supporting the proposed data collection or instruments that will be used as part of the study are included as attachments, such as data collection instrument(s); a copy of the Federal Register Notice; a copy of instructions or letters sent to respondents describing the study; a copy of applicable sections of laws or regulations regarding the data collection (may not be applicable); and a list of consulted individuals (if a focus group or expert panel was consulted during the development of the data collection instrument). 

ACTION II Partnerships must comply with OMB Clearance for task orders whenever applicable (see Requirement #12 in SOW).  Thus, each ACTION II Partnership will be required to identify an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization to be responsible for ensuring that such federal requirements are met and coordinating all activities associated with doing so. 

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to obtain OMB Clearances and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request to subcontract for the expertise, using task order award funds, through a pre-arranged AHRQ contractor. Arrangements to work with the subcontractor to develop the OMB Clearance package shall be included in the technical proposal and the cost of the subcontract shall be included in the cost proposal for the task order in question. That is to say, whether the proposal team requests a subcontractor through AHRQ or supplies the expertise itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs.

2. Adherence to Section 508 Compliance and Web Product Requirements 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 
There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format - including text, audio or video - that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 
All contractors and subcontractors or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards as codified in 36 CFR Part 1194, and where applicable, those set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). Remediation of any materials that do not comply with all necessary accessibility standards shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.  Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to meet these federal requirements for electronic products and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request assistance from AHRQs Section 508 Technical Assistance Center (www.ahrw.gov/508tac/tacover.htm). The Centers web page includes a menu of services and the charges related to each requested service. Services include: conversion and remediation of developed, non-compliant products, training and education, and consulting and expert services.  If a Partnership plans to avail itself of specific Section 508 Technical Assistance Center services, the technical task order proposal shall include information on necessary tasks to be accomplished via a subcontract with Section 508 Technical Assistance Center staff; the cost of the required services shall be included in the cost proposal. 

In addition to assistance with adherence to Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act, the Center can assist with website usability of task order products, and other HHS and federal regulations regarding management, privacy and security of IT systems, and/or designing websites and creating website graphics. Technical assistance will be available for ACTION II contractors that need help to support evolving user needs for electronic products, or improved system administration, performance, search, navigation and usability for such products. In addition, technical assistance may include development of websites and other electronic products that are in full compliance with all relevant sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition to the Section 508 compliance Web resources provided above, information on accessibility can be found at:

4. Dissemination, Communication and Marketing

Simply providing information to potential users is insufficient to generate substantial rates of actual use of the information by specific target audiences. A key to successful implementation in health care delivery is to more closely link researchers, users and other decision makers to ensure both the usefulness of information generated and the actual use of that information in practice. The literature suggests that actual use of research increases when:
	The research findings meet the expressed needs of the target audience
	Short-term and long-term information-sharing relationships and networks are created between researchers and target audiences
	An integrated set of strategies and tactics, specifically designed to support practical use of research, is employed over a substantial period of time. 

For ACTION II project results considered by AHRQ to merit further investment in dissemination, communication and marketing, technical assistance from AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) may include, but is not limited to: 
	creation of varied and appropriate dissemination products and vehicles
	assistance in determining the most appropriate target audiences and the content needs of those audiences
	performing and promoting website marketing and dissemination; and/or convening technical expert panels and meetings
	identifying, conducting, preparing and delivering educational activities, teleconferences and webinars
	identifying opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas, approaches, best practices and lessons learned across AHRQ grantees, contractors and project initiatives, and coordinating and facilitating identified common activities and interests across these efforts where cost-effective
	providing assistance in use of health information exchanges, IT networks, connectivity, hardware, software, interoperability and standards
	designing and offering special, limited technical assistance engagements, to meet the needs of regional AHRQ partners, stakeholders and others in their project efforts.
	Reviewing awardee final reports and findings, providing summaries of key findings, lessons learned and best practices identified while providing technical assistance.
	devising adoption strategies that can be readily accepted and are likely to be sustained. Examples may include issue papers, briefs, implementation stories, podcasts, Webinars, etc. 

The value of task order deliverables for intended audiences it is not always known with certainty in advance. As such, this level of dissemination, communication and marketing activity is not necessarily expected to be included in a task order proposal.  However, if AHRQ deems that additional dissemination, communication and marketing for a specific deliverable is likely to have potential value, the Partners involved will be expected to work collaboratively with OCKT staff to  at a minimum - familiarize them with the features, benefits and limitations of the task order deliverables in question.

<DESC>1. Questions & answers are posted (two attachments - "Q&A 3-4-10 set 3 & 4" and "Q&A 3-8-10 set 5").

2.  CLARIFICATION:  Section 15625 Centrifugal Water Chillers, paragraph  2.02 B, only applies to chiller number 3.

3.  CLARIFICATION:  The synopsis of work (file name Overview of Work at Schwartz) document is intended as a broad overview only, and did not include all subordinate tasks.  In particular, the work described in the Enovity scope of work was summarized only in terms of the controls work.  However the demand control ventilation, motor replacement, and AHU VFD requirements (corresponding to contract price form CLINs 6, 7, 8) still apply to the project.  In order to avoid confusion, the synopsis is revised to itemize this work.

4.  CHANGE:  Chiller project, specification section 15269, VFD, page 15269.5, paragraph 2.02.F.11 - requirement for output filters on chiller VFDs is deleted.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The pool exhaust system has deteriorated due to the chlorine content in the air in the pool space, with the system operating at only 50% efficiency. There are currently no GFI power outlets in the pool area. The facility lacks proper emergency lighting, resulting in patrons being trapped in unlighted spaces in the event of a power outage. Interior finishes and fixtures in the DV locker room require replacement as they have become worn with age. Basketball court ceiling paint is deteriorating and flaking off onto the basketball court below. Basketball court lighting needs replacement. Workout area surfaces are becoming worn and require painting.</p>

<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract for support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) ensuring critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data. Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Network Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Information received will be solely for the purpose of market research and acquisition planning. The Government is under no obligation to pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI. The attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) is a draft and subject to change before issuance of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) at a later date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The North American Industrial Classification System Number (NAICS) is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $27M.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA in support of the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager-Guardian Product Manager-Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) has a need for Increment 2 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System that can automate the verification, authentication, and entry of personnel and vehicles into military installations. The Increment 2 AIE requirement minimizes the guard force requirements while maintaining or increasing personnel and vehicle throughput. It also enables adaptation of increased authentication requirements at increased threat levels. Increment 2 is totally independent of Increment 1 and will likely result in fielding of Increment 2 AIE systems at approximately 40 military installations throughout the United States. The capability primarily consists of integrated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. The Government anticipates releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about May 28, 2009 that will be open for thirty (30) days. It is anticipated that the RFP will result in a single-award, Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract. The scope-of-work under this contract will include design, fielding, testing, training, and interim logistics support. The Government anticipates that the awarded contract will be for a one-year base period with four (4) one year options for a total estimated maximum contract value of $182 million. The estimated award date is August 31, 2009. This procurement is a full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.<BR><BR>Comments related to this synopsis should be submitted via email no later than 03:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, May 15, 2009 to the following Natick Contracting Division contact David.W.Mark@us.army.mil

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis Taconic Farm, Inc., One Hudson City Centre, Hudson, NY 12534.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires Mutant Mice - CSMD1 knockout mice  Minimum of 4, Heterzygous for the selected mutation, including at least one breeding pair to include a validated genotyping protocol and animal health data.  The Molecular Neurobiology Research Branch plans to study the effects of deletion of the CSMD1 gene and several different models of the behavioral and psychological effects of cocaine, such as the acute locomotor effects, the ability of cocaine to induce conditioned locomotion (locomotion in response to an environment previously associated with the drug), and conditioned place preference (approach to a location previously associated with the drug). Taconic Farms, Inc. is the only company that sells CSMD1 knockout mice and since clusters of snps in the CSMD1 gene were found to be positively associated with addiction, we only want CSMD1 knockout mice at this time.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NIHDA2010151, may be submitted by 4:30 p.m. March 23, 2010 to the NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  Carol Lindsay

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   Amendment 1 to RFQ-DC-10-00053
The purpose of this amendment is to provide an estimated value, answer one question, and direct all interested parties to the EPA website. 
1) EPA estimates orders placed under the Basic Ordering Agreements to total approximately $500,000 annually. This estimate is not guaranteed and represents the aggregate value of potential  work ordered from all BOA holders together.
2) Question: May vendors reply to this announcement to analyze only DLM02.2 and the 12 dioxin-like PCBs for CBC01.2? Our laboratory is not interested in performing analysis for all 209 congeners.
Answer: Vendors may be awarded a BOA for DLM02.2 and a subset of PCB congeners, as long as the subset includes the WHO list. However, the laboratory will not be eligible to bid on individual projects that require one lab to perform both the dioxin and full list of PCB congeners.
3) It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/1000053/index.htm for future updates to this procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY-PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO Veolia Water North America Operating Service, Inc. under current contract number:  DAAE30-02-C-1101.  Erroneously this notice was originally reported to be awarded to Chugach, Inc. under Contract Number:  W15QKN-05-C-1023 (solicitation number:  W15QKN-10-T-0603).   This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a modification under an existing contract.  This contract modification was not awarded as a firm fixed price contract type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for commercial supplies and services per FAR 12.207(b).  This award in the amount of $5,000 was for repair parts to replace failing components on the existing Telemetry/SCADA System in the control room of the Water Plant Bldg. 1383, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ under Project 28696.

<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities. This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Shriver Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  For informational purposes only.  This is a within scope modification to a competitively awarded IDIQ contract- New Year Tech, HHSN263200800005I, task order LARC-2008-OLAW-0019, line item #2.   This modification provides ARRA funding in the amount of $26,732.55 to support the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare for Option Year 1.  The DUNS number for New Year Tech, Inc. is 17-994-4574.  Contract HHSN263200800005I and awarded task orders under this contract were subject to a Novation Agreement on December 1, 2009.  The DUNS number for the transferee, JS Technology, Inc. is 832328202.  The work scope being accomplished under the task order modification as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is within the scope of the contract. The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior issuance of the modification.   The work contemplated varies depending on the influx of ARRA funded grants, making it difficult to accurately estimate the extent or duration of work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  (FAR 16.601(c))
