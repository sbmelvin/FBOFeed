This technology development shall yield a real time detection GPR capable of detecting both shallow (less than 12 inches) close-in (down-looking) and deeply buried (up to 36 inches) AT mines and munitions based targets.  The system shall have a real time operator interface which requires little direct operator involvement.  The contractor shall be required to successfully demonstrate the following performance objectives:  detection of IEDs and AT mines on primary and secondary roads with a high probability of detection (greater than 0.90), a low false alarm rate (less than 0.001 per square meter), at detection speeds up to 30 kilometers per hour, and at tactically relevant overburden depths up to 36 inches.  The estimated period of performance is forty-eight (48) months.   The resultant contract will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract.  It has been determined that NIITEK, Inc. is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sesame Workshop, One Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY  10023 for a 1 year base contract with a 12-month option period for the production of multi-media instructional/interactive/training resources that will reach millions of children (ages 2 to 8) and adults in military families to assist them in understanding and handling the multiple issues involving deployments, multiple deployments, and returning family members or friends who may have physical or psychological injuries.  Talk, Listen, Connect: Phase II conducted by Sesame Workshop, will produce 400,000 DVD kits containing 2 DVDs and a Parent manual.  The DVDs will provide educational information utilizingSesame Street characters in a fictional story, and documentary footage of interviews with military families facing multiple deployments and physical/psychological injury.  The parent manual will aid the parents in prompting family discussion and give parents guidance on how to cope with childrens emotional reactions to deployments.  All DVD kits will be available in both English and Spanish.  All materials will also be made available through an internet website which will also contain additional materials.  The Departments requirement is for the vendor to provide a product that utilizes fantasy characters who are (a) extremely well-known to young children and (b) in whom children place implicit trust. The role of character credibility is primary to facilitate the educational process which is the purpose and focus of the DVDs. We have determined through literature search that Sesame Workshop is the only vendor that provides a primarily educational (as opposed to an entertainment) venue for children ages 2-8which is both universally well-known by preschool age children, and which has a high level of trust and credibility as measured empirically through the attitudes of mothers of preschool age children.No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believesit can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within five calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate thefirms ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at: USAMRAA, ATTN: MCMR-AAA-P (Justin Pickett), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract. Note 22 applies.<BR><BR>Sole Souce Justification: <BR>1.  Authority Cited. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) -- Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in:  (a)  substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or (b)  unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.<BR>2.  Reason for Authority Cited.  This is a follow-on project to Phase I completed by Sesame Workshop in 2006.  Phase I was underwritten by a commercial entity, but utilized DoD logistical support, consisting of distribution of materials through the Military OneSource program.  Kits were provided by request to individual families, installation child development centers, andhealth clinics.  Additionally the Military OneSource web site provided a link to the Sesame Workshop web site where families could view the materials via streaming video.  The kits were designed to facilitate communication among deployed service members, their spouses and their preschool children around issues of deployment. The materials were aimed at nurturing family relationships, mitigate the development of emotional problems in children as a result of separation from the service member, instruct parent s on techniques to engage children in discussing the separation anxiety, and how to recognize such in children unable to express themselves. <BR>The results of Phase I undoubtedly showed that children as well as parents who used the materials were at a clear advantage when childrens behavior and emotional responses to separation were examined.  Research showed that children were less likely to suffer from emotional distress because the Sesame Street characters utilized in the DVDs gained the childrens trust and were highly recognizable.  Another study showed that children who watched the DVDs behaved better in school than children who did not watch the DVDs.  As shown in the results of Phase I, the Sesame Workshop DVDs created a positive experience for both the children and parents of deployed service members, and is recognized as a highly specialized service. <BR>The present project, to be underwritten by DoD with O&M funds (DHP dollars aimed at preventing emotional or behavioral disorders), proposes to use similar techniques and materials to look beyond issues related to deployment and separation, to those of dealing emotionally with parental injury on return from deployment, as well as issues surrounding multiple parental deployment.  Thus, this project is essentially a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services. <BR>Seeking a vendor other than Sesame Workshop would cause undue delay (approximately one year to recreate the work completed in Phase I), at a point when operational tempo is high and family separations (and the stresses that go with them) are frequent and difficult for those left at home to manage. It would requirefrom scratch development of new products, that essentially duplicate those developed in Phase I described above in order to maintain consistency in the characters portrayed and message imparted.  Furthermore, seeking another vendor would cause a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.<BR> The Departments requirement is for the vendor to provide a product that utilizes fantasy characters who are (a) extremely well-known to young children and (b) in whom children place implicit trust. The role of character credibility is primary to facilitate the educational process which is the purpose and focus of the DVDs. We have determined through literature search that Sesame Workshop is the only vendor that provides a primarily educational (as opposed to an entertainment) venue for children ages 2-8 which is both universally well-known by preschool age children, and which has a high level of trust and credibility as measured empirically through the attitudes of mothers of preschool age children. Further, Sesame Workshop is the only vendor whose previous work has been scientifically established to have been associated with decreased feelings of depression and hopelessness in wives of deployed service members. <BR>3.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  Discussions and interviews were held with various DoD Subject Matter Experts from the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences Department of Psychology (specifically child psychologists), who were asked to provide recommendations of appropriate potential offerors.   The internet was also searched extensively to find companies that had experience and could compete in this area. None were found that could support the specific requirement of high trust and reconcilability in the target age group while providing materials that are both educational and entertaining. <BR>4.  Actions to Increase Competition.This is a one-time requirement and no future similar acquisitions are anticipated.  However, if a similar requirement arises, every effort will be made to compete it to the maximum extent practicable.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Agency, White Sands Directorate (WSMR DOC), White Sands Missile Range in support of Test Resource Management Center, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), is soliciting white papers and proposals, both technical and costsfor innovative research and development concepts focused in the area of Unmanned and Autonomous System Testing (UAST).  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and or exploratory development of four technology areas in terms of four topic areas.  The BAA is conducted using full and open competition. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, the BAA utilizes a two- step process. The first step will be the submission of a white paper.The white paper must contain as a minimum: Title, Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude Cost, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email, Task Objective, Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.  Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two).  The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award.  White papers submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A white papers technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.

This solicitation is for interpretive panels for Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge located 15 miles from Sherman, Texas as described in the Statement of Work below.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24, Effective 31 Mar 2008. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 201818Q011; this solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This procurement action is a total set aside for small business.  The NAICS Code is 541430 Graphic Design Services and size standard is $6.0.
STATEMENT OF WORK:1.0 Significance of Hagerman National Wildlife RefugeThe Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge encompasses more than 11,000 acres in Grayson County, located in north-central Texas approximately 15 miles from the City of Sherman (population 31,600). Several small towns are within 60 miles of the Refuge. Dallas, with a population of 1,007,000, is within 75 miles of the Refuge. Including Ft. Worth and the Mid-Cities, more than 2,000,000 people live within 100 miles of the Refuge.
The Refuge provides various wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities with wildlife observation and photography being the most popular, followed by fishing. According to traffic counts, the Refuge receives approximately 120,000 visitors a year. The majority of visitors are from nearby locations, though proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex allows for visitors from foreign countries to tour the Refuge.
In cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Refuge was established in 1946 on lands purchased by the U.S. Department of the Army for the Denison Dam Project.
Strategically situated on the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma, the Refuge provides valuable sanctuary for the natural resources of the Great Plains. The Refuge is located on the Big Mineral Arm of Lake Texoma in a transitional zone between two major vegetational areas known as the Blackland Prairies and the Eastern Cross Timbers where the gently rolling prairies meet the south side of Lake Texoma. The Refuge is located at the heart of a culturally diverse community in rural north-central Texas with increasing influences from the nearby urban areas of Dallas and Forth Worth. The distinct landscape, diversity of biological communities, and secluded location are inherent characteristics that contribute to the area's value as a natural preserve. The Refuge provides a variety of protected habitats for wildlife, open space and nature-oriented recreational activities for the public.
The influences of the Blackland Prairies and Eastern Cross Timbers contribute to the diversity of plant species on the Refuge. Stream banks and overflow floodplains support typical bottomland hardwood vegetation. The Blackland Prairies and Eastern Cross Timbers encompass approximately 26,000 square miles in north and central Texas and represent the primary ecological region of northcentral Texas.
The Refuge is located within the Central Flyway, a route traveled annually by numerous species of waterfowl and migratory birds. The Refuge enjoys a reputation as a birding mecca in north-central Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the Refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species regularly occur on the Refuge, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory.
This northcentral area of Texas has always been a historic waterfowl area. Farming of grain crops, and the availability of small lakes and stock tanks, provided the necessary habitats for migrating birds, especially waterfowl. Today, the Refuge continues to offer food and sanctuary to migratory waterfowl in the fall, winter and spring. The value of these lands that were set aside and dedicated to providing waterfowl habitat, benefit other migratory bird species throughout the year. Each spring and fall sees thousands of shorebirds thronging the mudflats on the lakeshore. Hundreds of wading birds flock to the Refuge to feed on food resources left by falling water levels in late summer.
The Refuge's land and water restoration activities are designed and implemented to improve waterfowl habitat, and to benefit more than 270 species of birds, 34 species of mammals, 65 species of reptiles and amphibians and 62 species of fish. While the primary challenges on the Refuge have centered primarily on restoration of habitat for migrating waterfowl, the Refuge also provides habitat for federally listed threatened and endangered species, and several other species of concern, including the least tern (Sterna antillarum), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi), Texas-horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum).
2.0	Interpretive ObjectivesThe majority of visitors to Hagerman NWR will gain an overall understanding of why the refuge was established.
The majority of visitors will be introduced to the major ecosystems and ecological processes that affect Hagerman NWR.
The majority of visitors will learn the importance of the refuge to migrating and resident bird species and be able to identify a few of the more common and intriguing bird species that utilize the refuge.
The majority of visitors will learn the multiple functions of the refuge in managing for wildlife, habitat and public use opportunities.
The majority of visitors will be able to recognize from the refuge map, their current location and the locations of other refuge public use areas, attractions, facilities and major landforms.
The majority of visitors will understand that Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge is one of over 545 NWR's belonging to the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). The NWRS is the largest national network of lands dedicated to the conservation of America's diverse and abundant wildlife resources and the habitats they depend upon.
3.0	Target Audience and ThemesHagerman NWR attracts approximately 250,000 visitors annually from throughout the country. Reasons for visiting the refuge are varied and include; sportsmen and women seeking hunting and fishing opportunities, wildlife observation (particularly bird-watching), wildlife photography, persons seeking the solitude and aesthetic qualities of nature and those wishing to learn more about the natural resources of the refuge.
Most visitors have little or no conservation background, but are interested in a general understanding of the importance of NWR's, specifically Hagerman NWR. Many fail to recognize the difference between NWR's, State wildlife management areas, State parks or National Parks.
Themes:1) Hagerman NWR is a very important area for the conservation of a diverse array of wildlife species and the habitats they depend upon. The refuge's role in conservation will become even more critical as habitat is continually lost, altered and fragmented. The refuge plays an important role in the protection, management and restoration of vital wildlife habitat in the southern Great Plains ecoregion.
2) Hagerman NWR provides the public with opportunities to enjoy and interact with the natural world. As part of its mission, the refuge provides hunting, fishing, bird-watching, wildlife photography and observation, outdoor interpretation and environmental education. Other uses are evaluated individually to determine compatibility with the mission of the refuge and its purpose.
3) Hagerman NWR is also an area with considerable historic significance, steeped in the rich cultural history of pre- and early-statehood Texas and the values and traditions of the Native American tribes inhabiting the area.
