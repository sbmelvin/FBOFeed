STATEMENT OF WORK 
Purchase of new Small fragment Screw Set for the Operating Rooms

Introduction

	The Brooklyn surgical service has a need to purchase a screw and plate set for operating room use. The instrumentation screw and plate and Power set can be utilized by multiple Services in the Operating Room.

Objective

       The Brooklyn Surgical Service must have available a second set of screw and plates when performing certain orthopedic surgeries. Because the pieces must be sterilized, if there is a problem with one set, we must have a backup set available. We already have a set and need to buy another set from the same manufacturer/vendor to be interchangeable. 

The instrumentation power set is mandatory in that it serves as a back-up to facilitate turnover times in the OR. The reusable medical equipment requires that proper protocols are adhered to according to manufacturer's guidelines for reprocessing and sterilization of equipment. Flash sterilization is not permitted and adhering to policy requires additional equipment to provide safe quality patient care in the Operating Room. The equipment Screw and plate also requires that a 48 hour biological be negative to utilize the implants contained in the sets. Having the set always sterilized and ready for use is imperative. It is not feasible when a loaner set is to be procured due to the nature of the Sterilization and biological parameters set forward in the SPS/OR policy for Sterilization


Period of Performance

	These are steel pieces and the life expectancy for the equipment is very long, many years. The company representative will provide any new training on the use. 


Special Material Requirements

There are no special material requirements needed in the performance or providing the equipment.

Other Requirements unique to the solicitation

There are no unique requirements to this solicitation.

<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>Project Title: Development of a Strategy, Goals, Recommendations and Providing Assistance in Managing FDA's Implementation of a Consent Decree, with a Focus on Application Integrity Policy (AIP)</p>
<p><br />Background <br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as amended, May 2001) has the authority to enforce judicial actions to ensure firm's compliance with the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR 210 and 211) for drug manufacturing and distribution of products, after a company has failed to respond to advisory action, such as untitled and warning letters. One such judicial action is an injunction, a civil judicial process initiated to stop or prevent violation of the law, such as to halt the flow of violative products in interstate commerce, and to correct the conditions that caused the violation to occur (11 U.S.C. 332; Rule 65, Rules of Civil Procedure). An injunction may be considered for any significant out-of-compliance circumstance, but particularly when a health hazard has been identified. Proceeding by injunction does not preclude institution of additional or concurrent action such as recall, publicity, seizures, embargo by cooperating officials, or criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>In considering an injunction, the agency must evaluate the seriousness of the offense, the actual or potential impact of the offense on the public, whether other possible actions could be as effective or more effective, the need for prompt judicial action, and whether it will be able to demonstrate the likelihood of the continuance of the violation in the absence of a court order. Injunction will be the action of choice when: <br />a. There is a current and definite health hazard or a gross consumer deception requiring immediate action to stop the violative practice; or <br />b. There are significant amounts of violative products owned by the same person, voluntary recall by the firm was refused or is significantly inadequate to protect the public, and seizures are impractical or uneconomical; or <br />c. There are long-standing (chronic) violative practices that have not produced a health hazard or consumer fraud, but which have not been corrected through use of voluntary or other regulatory approaches.</p>
<p>With respect to a. and b. above, it is helpful, but not mandatory, to show that there has been a history of prior violations, and that previous attempts to correct them through alternative warnings or sanctions have not been effective. A showing of a violative history should be made whenever possible, but especially in those cases where an imminent danger to health cannot be alleged. <br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has an option to file a consent decree of permanent injunction against a company. In drafting a consent decree, Office of Chief Counsel will seek center approval on matters germane to its original review, including reconditioning or reprocessing plans, CGMP requirements, recalls, cessation of product manufacturing or distribution operations, and measures that could affect availability of medically necessary products. OCC will seek the district's approval on matters requiring district follow-up activities, such as reinspection frequency and rates, reviews of defendant's corrective actions, and witnessing destruction and disposition of goods from distributing unapproved and misbranded drugs.</p>
<p>The consent decree often provides a series of measures that, when satisfied, will permit a firm to resume the manufacture and distribution of products marketed by itself and its subsidiaries. Additionally, as part of the consent decree, a firm may agree not to market products it manufactures until it has satisfied certain requirements designed to demonstrate compliance with FDA's current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) regulations. Finally, a drug manufacturing firm may also agree that it will not distribute certain products until the products are approved by FDA's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) or New Drug Application (NDA) processes.</p>
<p>The Agency may also include in the Consent Decree a provision that before resuming manufacturing, a firm will have an independent third party CGMP and/or AIP expert consultant undertake a review of the firm's facilities and certify compliance with FDA's CGMP regulations and verify the reliability of data in drug application submissions. Following that certification, FDA would make a determination as to whether the firm's facilities are in compliance.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to describe the activities associated with adopting the best strategy and management in assisting the FDA staff in understanding the requirements and goals leading to a successful outcome of an AIP consent decree.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The Office of Compliance seeks to procure the services of a contractor to provide guidance to the Office of Compliance staff, especially the Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality and the Division of Scientific Investigations, to determine how best to manage the consent decree involving Application Integrity Policy (AIP). The AIP focuses on the integrity of data and information in applications submitted for Agency review and approval. On September 10, 1991, the FDA published the Notice of this policy formally entitled, "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities; Final Policy" (Federal Register, 56 FR 46191). The AIP describes the Agency's approach regarding the review of applications that may be affected by wrongful acts that raise significant questions regarding data reliability. The FDA published the Federal Register (FR) Notice and a companion document, "Points to Consider for Internal Reviews and Corrective Action Operating Plans," in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7150.09 (see Sec. 120.100 of the Compliance Policy Guides publication).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the period of performance for this contract will be one twelve (12) month award.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p><br />Technical Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>FDA will evaluate quotes against the following technical evaluation factors: Relevant Experience, Technical Approach, Qualifications of Key Personnel, and Management Plan. The FDA will also evaluate the proposed pricing and past performance. This evaluation will be conducted using a best value methodology. Technical merit will be significantly more important than price in evaluating proposals. FDA will evaluate all price proposals to determine whether the pricing is reasonable; however, the lowest-priced offeror will not necessarily be awarded the contract. In the event that two or more offerors technical proposals are deemed to be of similar merit, price will be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors<br />The relative order of importance of the factors is:<br />&#61607; The Relevant Experience and Technical Approach factors are equally rated and of the most importance. <br />Qualifications of Key Personnel and Management Plan/Schedule are of equal importance.</p>
<p>1. Relevant Experience</p>
<p>The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate relevant experience in terms of type, scope, complexity and size on current and previous contracts. The highly rated proposal will also demonstrate the Offeror's ability to produce high quality results on a very tight schedule.</p>
<p>2. Technical Approach <br />This factor considers the Offeror's methodology for accomplishing the work outlined in the SOW. The Offeror's proposal will demonstrate a thorough understanding and clear approach for performance of work resulting from this SOW. FDA will consider:</p>
<p>&bull; The Offeror's understanding of the scope and objectives of the subject areas and tasks outlined in the SOW<br />&bull; The offeror's capabilities with respect to the subject areas and tasks outlined in the SOW<br />&bull; The likelihood of success of the technical approach</p>
<p>3. Key Personnel and Management Plan/Schedule</p>
<p>This factor considers the education, experience, knowledge and necessary skills of key personnel. The offeror shall provide resumes for the key personnel. The offeror shall indicate how the proposed personnel's experience and knowledge meets the needs and expectations identified in the SOW. The offeror's plans for carrying out all phases of the contract work as it pertains to scheduling work assignments and allocating work resources. The evaluation will assess the appropriateness of the offeror's management plan to the work outlined in the SOW, including (as applicable) methodologies, staffing plan that specifically outlines the estimated level of effort by labor category, preparation, performance measures, management tools, cost control, schedule control, quality control, risk mitigation, and communications will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Price Evaluation</p>
<p>FDA will evaluate the Offeror's proposed price. The FDA's evaluation of price realism will consider the extent to which proposed pricing indicates a clear understanding of solicitation requirements, reflects a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and is consistent with the approach described in the offeror's technical volume quote. The price realism assessment will consider technical and management risks identified during evaluation of the quote. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.</p>
<p>The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>
<p>Basis for Award:</p>
<p>Award will be made to the party whose quotation offers the best overall value to the Government, technical and price factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Approach and Relevant Experience, 2) Qualifications of Key Personnel and Management Plan, and 3) Price. The Technical Approach and Relevant Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel and Management Plan factors are of equal importance and, combined, these factors are more important than the price factor. If two or more quotations are determined to be approximately equal technically, price may become the determining factor in selecting the awardee. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>PART 1<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION <br /><br />The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to prevent death, disease, and injury from mining and to promote safe and healthful workplaces for the Nation's miners. MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), the Miner Act of 2006 and enforces compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines. <br />The Office of Employee Safety and Health (OESH) was established within MSHA to help managers furnish a safe and healthful work environment for MSHA employees. The OESH oversees three functions for MSHA employees: (1) Safety and Health programs, (2) The Workers' Compensation Program, and (3) The Medical Review Section, which evaluates physical exam results to make determinations on medical clearance for enforcement and other designated positions. <br />The OESH utilizes medical standards and functional requirements to determine the suitability applicants for and incumbents in enforcement and other designated work positions. Applicants and employees must be physically capable of performing arduous duties efficiently and without hazard to themselves or others. Medical examinations are required for all applicants of positions that involve regular or intermittent performance of inspection, investigation, rescue duties, or duties involving mine site visits. Medical conditions that constitute a hazard to safe and efficient job performance are disqualifying. The presence of medical disorders that would be aggravated by the environmental conditions of these positions and thereby hinder safe and efficient job performance are also disqualifying. MSHA requires employees whose positions fall under medical standards to undergo a complete physical examination at a frequency of once every three years, or more frequently if a fitness-for-duty question arises. MSHA requires Mine Rescue team members to have a physical examination every year.<br /><br />1.1 OBJECTIVES:<br />The objectives of this effort are to:<br />1. Identify and evaluate physical demands and functional requirements of the routine duties of enforcement and other designated work positions;<br />2. Implement appropriate medical standards consistent with physical work demands and functional requirements of enforcement and other designated work positions, in accordance with applicable regulations, guidelines, and best medical practices;<br />3. Evaluate components and scope of Pre-Placement, Periodic, and Mine Rescue physical exams and determine appropriate test requirements and optimal frequency of these medical examinations;<br />4. Strengthen the overall medical evaluation process by establishing comprehensive and standardized procedures; Increase efficiency and communication by implementing electronic transfer and electronic storage of medical records; Encourage enforcement personnel to maintain appropriate physical fitness by developing and utilizing a basic, in-house functional capacity test. <br /><br />1.2 PURPOSE: The purpose of this project is to validate MSHA's medical standards and physical examination requirements, encourage and monitor physical fitness among employees in enforcement and other designated work positions, and utilize technological advancements to store and transfer medical records electronically. <br /><br />1.3 SCOPE: This project affects applicants and employees of enforcement and other designated positions, program areas, management, and the Office of Employee Safety and Health staff. <br /><br />1.4 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance is not to exceed 180 work days from start of contract. <br /><br />1.5 QUALITY CONTROL: The contractor shall ensure only qualified individuals provide the services described in this statement of work (SOW).

<p>&nbsp;<br />PART 6<br />APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS</p>
<p><br />REFERENCES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES</p>
<p>At a minimum, Contractor performance in accordance with the requirements herein shall fully comply with the following laws, regulations, policies and guidelines:</p>
<p>&bull; Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 - Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)<br />&bull; The Privacy Act of 1974, PL 93-579, as amended<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-123 Revised, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, December 2004<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, July 23, 1993<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources<br />&bull; Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policies for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors<br />&bull; Department of Labor, Computer Security Handbook (CSH)</p>
<p><br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:<br />- 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (FEB 2012)<br />- 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition, with the following addendum to paragraph a:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability<br />1. Experience<br />2. Understanding of the Requirement<br />B. Past Performance<br />C. Price</p>
<p>The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor C, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor A, and its associated sub-factors. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br />The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience in relation to current or previous work performed in similar size and scope to this requirement as well as the experience of Key Personnel. <br /><br />Sub-factor 2: UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.</p>
<p><br />PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) previous contracts for current relevancy (within 3 years), with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1. Offeror's shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government.</p>
<p>Performance. Offerors shall provide a specific narrative explanation of each contract listed in Section 1 describing the objectives achieved and detailing how the effort is relevant to the requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(a) For any contracts that did not/do not meet original schedule or technical performance requirements, provide a brief explanation of the reason(s) for the shortcomings and any corrective action(s) taken to avoid recurrence. The offerors shall list each time the delivery schedule was revised and provide an explanation of why the revision was necessary. All Requests for Deviation and Requests for Waiver shall be addressed with respect to causes and corrective actions. The offerors shall also provide a copy of any Cure Notices or Show Cause Letters received on each contract listed and a description of any corrective action implemented by the offeror or proposed subcontractor. The offerors shall indicate if any of the contracts listed were terminated and the type and reasons for the termination.</p>
<p><br />New Corporate Entities. New corporate entities may submit data on prior contracts involving its officers and employees. However, in addition to the other requirements in this section, the offeror shall discuss in detail the role performed by such persons in the prior contracts cited. Information should be included in the files described in the sections above.</p>
<p>Past Performance Questionnaire. The offeror shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to the Government and private sector technical representative responsible for the past/current contract. The POC's shall be instructed to electronically complete Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to the Contract Specialist, Worrells.deborah@dol.gov no later than <strong>May 2, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST.</strong> The offeror shall also e-mail to the Contract Specialist a list of all the POC's who were sent a questionnaire. The Government must receive this list no later than <strong>April 27, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST</strong>. The POC List shall be submitted in Word for Windows Table Format to include the following fields: Solicitation Number; Company Name; Contract Number; Government Agency; POC Last Name, First Name; POC Title; POC Telephone Number; POC E-Mail Address; Date E-Mailed to POC (month/day). Please note, that the Past Performance Questionnaire will not be a part of the resultant contract.</p>
<p>PRICE. The offeror shall complete Schedule B (Cost/Price Schedule), with pricing for the base and each option period. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factors I, Technical (See Table 1), Adjectival ratings for Factor II (See Table 2), Past Performance will be Low Risk, High Risk, and Unknown Risk. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor A- Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL DEFINITION<br /><br />Outstanding -&nbsp;A proposal that exceeds all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses.</p>
<p>Good - A proposal that exceeds some of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses,.</p>
<p>Acceptable -&nbsp;A proposal that meets all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems.</p>
<p>Unacceptable -&nbsp;A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Factor B- Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL DESCRIPTION<br />Low Risk Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />Moderate Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />High Risk Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />Unknown Risk Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.</p>

(VIII) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008), applies to this acquisition. In addition to written price quotes, offerors are instructed to provide past performance references as stated in paragraph (10) of the referenced clause.

(IX) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. Offers will be evaluated based on price and the factors set forth in paragraph (a), of the referenced clause, and award will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Government.  Paragraph (a) is hereby completed as follows:  
(a)  Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated upon the non-price or non-cost factors, which are listed in descending order of importance with Factor A bearing most of the weight and Factor A will be weighted twice that of Factor B.
Factor (A) Experience: Offerors shall include resumes and/or qualifications identified in the Statement of Work, including the following: 1. Short statement (or resume) of relevant work experience, documenting type of work performed, length of service, equipment used, etc. 2. Short statement of training received and experience in performing precise magnetic measurements with delicate theodolite instruments: type of training, frequency of training, last date of training, and source (USGS or other). 3. Short statement of experience in operating and maintaining complex magnetometer and/or specialized geophysical recording systems.
Factor (B) Past Performance (quality, timeliness, and business relations):  The offeror shall submit references from at least one (1) customer that has purchased similar services within the last five years.  Offerors shall provide a point of contact name, phone number, and company address for those reference(s).   Statements by past clients may be used in the evaluation of the vendor's technical quote under any and all applicable evaluation criteria. Any information obtained by the Government from references outside the vendor's quote may be used in a similar manner.
 (b)  Options.  The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.
In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be more important than evaluated price.  Price will become the determining factor between proposals judged to be essentially equal in technical merit.  PPIRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information acquired both inside and outside the government.
Your proposal should be straightforward and free of extraneous information. Technical proposals will be evaluated without reference to proposed prices/costs. Therefore, no references to price or cost may be included in your technical proposal. If helpful, technical proposals should include information on staffing levels and/or estimated levels of effort, but such data should not include dollar rates or costs.  Simply repeating or paraphrasing the specifications or statement of work does not constitute an acceptable technical proposal. Technical proposals must demonstrate how the offeror proposes to meet stated requirements or goals, and that the offeror has the necessary understanding, expertise, facilities, personnel, and experience to successfully accomplish the proposed work.  The technical proposal should contain (1) identifying cover page; (2) table of contents; (3) listing(s) of tables, drawings, and/or exhibits, if any; and (4) a short introduction or summary describing the overall approach, if desired.  The main body of the technical proposal must provide sufficient information and detail to permit the evaluators to score the proposal on each of the factors listed above in Evaluation - Commercial Items.

(X) The offeror shall submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2008), with its quote. An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.
