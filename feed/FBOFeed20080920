Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>CA/CST/DO owns and has in use several Dell servers, Dell PowerEdge 6650, Dell PowerEdge 1750, and Dell PowerEdge 2650.  These Dell servers are used to support projects throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area, located at SA-1, Harry S Truman Building, BIMC, and North Glebe Road.  The warranties already have or are about to expire; however, they are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/DO.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that Dell will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.  Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with Dell servers and the service Dell provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Dell servers.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to procure on a sole source basis pooled shRNA lentiviral libraries in both a viral and plasmid format for both the mouse and human genomes with Systems Biosciences, Inc., 1616 N. Shoreline Blvd. Mountain View, CA 94043.

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification code is 325414 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Period of Performance:  Delivery within sixty (60) days of award.

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain state-of-the-art tools for applying high-throughput, RNAi-mediated gene silencing to study various pathways and processes in mammalian cell systems. Large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) studies have facilitated the search for genes required for diverse biological processes enabling stepwise dissection of specific signaling pathways.  In combination with high-throughput assays, genome-wide RNAi studies have uncovered novel gene functions in various biological processes through loss of function approaches. Several of these studies were aimed at the identification of genes essential for cell division, cell cycle progression, endocytosis, tumor transformation and apoptosis. Through these studies, the power of this approach for the identification of functional modules has been demonstrated.A combination of short hairpin RNA vector libraries in both viral (lentivirus) and plasmid forms are being sought to support these types of loss-of-function assays.  In addition, microRNA precursor pooled libraries are also being sought to assist CCR investigators in the understanding of the role of miRNAs in biological processes, such as in cancer development.  This library will enable the study of phenotypic effects associated with the over-expression of individual microRNAs.

Contractor Requirements:
The contractor shall provide pooled shRNA lentiviral libraries in both a viral and plasmid format for both the mouse and human genomes. The libraries must contain up to 40,000 cloned shRNAs with 3-5 shRNA species per gene target (minimum of 160,000 clones total).  The purchase of the viral library will enable about several investigators to perform experiments immediately while the plasmid library can be processed by one of NCIs core laboratories to produce enough virus for hundreds of additional experiments.  The CCR requires a minimum of 100 x 10^6 IFUs for approximately 12-15 initial experiments for multiple PIs and 1 mg of pooled plasmid library stock, which will be used to produce additional virus stock for further distribution.  The contractor shall also provide a pre-packaged library representing a pool of at least 500 known miRNAs to be used by CCR investigators to enable the study of phenotypic effects associated with the over-expression of individual microRNAs.


This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM ET September 24, 2008.  Faxed and E-mailed capability statements are not authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at Holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive and award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-80235-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Jali Medical Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION*1.  Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:VA Boston Healthcare System:  Mental Health Research DepartmentTransaction number 523-08-4-7821-0147*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:Purchase of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation equipment from Jali Medical Inc.*3.  Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):43,052.00There are no stimulators available, other than the Magstim model 9450-00 with the capacity for low interval paired stimulus delivery. This was confirmed by two expert laboratories performing similar research: Mark George, MD, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Radiology and Neurology, Director, Center for Advanced Imaging Research, Director, Brain Stimulation Laboratory, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC and Sarah Lisanby, MDAssociate Professor of Clinical PsychiatryChief, Brain Stimulation and Therapeutic Modulation Division, Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric InstituteA single magnetic stimulator is not able to deliver repeated pulses fast enough for the paired pulse experimental paradigm essential for estimating GABAergic tone in the CNS. The minimum pulse interval for the Magstim is 2 seconds.  Paired pulses are delivered at 2, 4, 10 15, and 20 millisecond (ms) intervals.

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.</p>
<p>( ) (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>
<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>
<p>(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>
<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).</p>

<p>( ) TIN has been applied for.</p>

<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101<br />OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS<br />WIDE AREA WORK FLOW (WAWF) PROGRAM</p>
<p><br />In March 2003, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS) subpart 232.70 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Payment Requests was issued. In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business. It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form. The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.</p>
<p>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment. WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world. Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office. WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.</p>
<p>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies. They cannot be "lost" or "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site. Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing. Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays. WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.</p>
<p>McGuire AFB began using testing this new system in February 2004 and plans to fully implement it by April 2004. There are no costs involved to get you started. Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way. To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system. This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA. Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions. Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist. Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil. (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.</p>
<p>&bull; If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />&bull; For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>&bull; All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />&bull; Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />&bull; Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).</p>
<p>&bull; The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />&bull; To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />&bull; Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />&bull; Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />&bull; The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />&bull; Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).</p>
<p>&bull; In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />&bull; A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />&bull; The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />&bull; The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />&bull; The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address</p>
<p>&bull; All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />&bull; The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />&bull; Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />&bull; Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />&bull; Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />&bull; Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />&bull; Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />&bull; PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />&bull; If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />&bull; Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).</p>
<p>&bull; If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-800-392-1798, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

The sequencing reagent, Bid Dye terminator Sequencing kit, shall have a narrow bandwidth (less than 40nm width at half height) strong balanced fluorescence peaks that are easily spectrally separated and have minimal overlap of emission bands, uniform electrophoretic mobility, strong resistance against laser-induced bleaching, absorption spectra that match the wavelength of a 520 nm Argon Laser, and peak height uniformity.  In addition, these reagents shall provide long reads for sequencing, 800-1200 nucleotides using the 3130xl or 3730 capillary electrophoresis instrument.  In addition, the reagent must be able to be used at half strength with the additive, dGTP, which has been specifically optimized to work in conjuction with Big Dye version 1.1 Dye terminator sequencing chemistry on the 3130x1 or 3730 Genetic Analyzer.  The DNA Polymerase, Ampli-TaqGold shall be form of Thermus Aquaticus that has the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues chemically modified such that the enzyme is inactive above pH 7.0, has a 5x3 exonuclease activity, does not have a 3  5 exonuclease activity and is forensically validated for carrying out the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for nucleic acid amplification.  The enzyme shall provide an automated Hot Start process (95 degreesC soak for 10 minutes) to lower the pH below 7 when the chemical modifications to the lysine residues are cleaved and the active site of the DNA polymerase becomes active.  The enzyme shall be recombinant rather than native form.  The enzyme shall be made and approved for use in processing forensic casework based on Fry and Dalbert Hearings.  The use of the quantification kit, such as the Quantifiler, and Quantifiler Y requires the vendor to provide a complete quantification system that has been optimized and validated for use in Forensics on the AB-7000 Sequence detection system. The system should be target specific assay components consisting of two primers to amplify the telemerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) gene (a single gene) and a Taqman MGB probe, which contains the FAM reporter dye coupled to the 5 end and a minor groove binder (MGB) and a non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) coupled to the 3 end.  The amplification kit, such as the identifiler, shall contain a primer set that amplifies the following loci in a single PCR amplification:  Amelogenin, CSFIPO, D2S1338, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D19S433, D21S11, FGA, TH01, TPOX, vWA.  The loci shall be consistent with major worldwide database recommendations including CODIS, ENFSI, and Interpol and should range from 100 to 450bp depending on the locus.  The kit shall use 5 dyes, which are easily spectrally separated and have minimal overlap of emission bands.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

GENERAL INFORMATION

INTRODUCTION

The National Labor Relations Board, Division of Administration, Library and Administrative Services Branch is seeking contract support to re-create 258 Agency forms in Adobe Livecyle PDF (compatible with Adobe Livecycle Designer 8.0).

BACKGROUND

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  (1) to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and (2) to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Subregional, and Resident Offices.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this request is to obtain contractor support to re-create 258 Agency forms in Adobe Livecycle PDF (compatible with Adobe Livecycle Designer 8.0).  Most of the  forms (234) are currently in Adobe Accelio Capture Designer and an electronic version of each form will be provided to the contractor on a CD.  The remaining 24 forms are only available in hard copy and a hard copy of each of those forms will be provided to the contractor.  Contractor will be required to re-create each form and provide a hard copy and an electronic version of each form.  The electronic version is to be provided on a CD.

SCOPE

The service provider will provide 1 hard copy and 1 electronic version of each newly created form.  The electronic version is to provided on a CD.

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED

The Government shall furnish 1 hard copy of 24 forms and 1 electronic version of 234 forms to be created.  The electronic version will be provided on CD.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The NLRB has 234 forms in Adobe Accelio Capture Designer and 24 forms in hard copy.  Each of the forms needs to be re-created in Adobe Livecycle PDF (compatible with Adobe Livecycle Designer 8.0).  The forms have been categorized by level of complexity as:

	Simple  forms that contain minimal or no customization, e.g., non-use of calculated fields or validation.  Forms tend to average 1 page in length.
	Moderate  forms that contain minor customization, e.g., field checks, minor field calculation fields.
	Complex  forms that expand multiple pages.  Includes numerous field calculations, edit checks, and custom features (e.g., auto-growth fields).

The categorization of forms is as follows:

	Simple  116 forms (121 estimated pages)
	Moderate  116 forms (173 pages)
	Complex  26 forms (43 estimated pages)

Each form is to be created in Adobe Livecycle PDF (compatible with Adobe Livecycle Designer 8.0) and the contractor must provide 1 hard copy of each form and 1 electronic version of each form.  The electronic version is to be provided on a CD.

The contractor shall perform 100% quality control of the new forms to ensure quality, completeness, and cosmetic appearance similar to the original documents or PDFs that exist.

The contractor shall compare the resulting fillable PDF file with the original forms provided.  The resulting electronic forms should contain the exact layout (e.g., design, pages) as the original document provided.  The end user shall be able to print, route save and edit the resulting electronic forms.  Any of the following PDF deficiencies will require correction by the contractor at no cost to the government:

	missing information, e.g, pages, text, input fields, etc.
	incorrect tab-order within user input fields
	form skewing, e.g., background image skewing, logo misplacements
	incorrect file naming of the resulting PDF file. 
	form not printing correctly.
	not being able to route form.
	not being able to edit or save form.
	
The testing and delivery timetable will be agreed upon, by the contractor and COTR, after contract award.

PROPOSAL EVALUATION

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in this solicitation.  Preference will be given to 8A businesses that are technically capable of performing the requirements outlined in this statement of work.  In addition to price, when determining best value, the NLRB will consider the proposed approach to re-create 258 Agency forms, with the appropriate consideration given to the following three evaluation factors:

	Factor 1.	Technical Approach
	Factor 2.	Past Performance
	Factor 3.	Price


The relative importance of the factors is that the technical approach factor is significantly more important than the past performance factor, which is slightly more important than the cost factor.  The non-price factors combined are significantly more important that the price factor.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than acceptable must be achieved for all factors.  Offerors are to be cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the offeror with the lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct business with one or more offerors and request revised proposals.

FACTOR 1:  Technical Approach This factor will be evaluated based on the extent to which the Offeror concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested.

a.	Technical Excellence  The degree to which the Offeror understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract; the technical approach for accomplishing the work in the SOW; that the Offeror thoroughly understands forms creation and Adobe Livecycle PDF to provide for problem identification, recordation, resolution, escalation, notification, and closeout of issue.

FACTOR 2:  Past Performance  Past performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Governments confidence in the Offerors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Offeror has undertaken within the last 5 years of similar size, scope, and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation.  No more than five (5) past performance references shall be submitted.  The following will be evaluated:

1.	Quality of Product  The degree to which the Offeror can show the ability to meet all requirements.

2.	Timeliness of Performance  The degree to which the Offeror meets established schedules or milestones.

3.	Cost Control  The degree to which the Offeror completes requirements within the established cost estimate.

4.	Business Relations  The degree to which the Offeror has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up-front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively, and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.


In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Offerors with no past performance shall so state.

FACTOR 3:  Price This factor will be evaluated based on competition and information supplied in each proposal.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in the lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical approach.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non-price factors.
