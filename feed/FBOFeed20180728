(8) Description
a.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION / SUMMARY: 
This project will provide Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site (BEOL) with a durable, integral color, cementitious finish for approximately 13,000 SF of exterior wall.  The finish will be applied to three exterior walls (North, East and West) which were replaced with CMU block in the early 1980s.  Currently, the exterior walls are finished with a non-historically accurate stucco finish and numerous instances of non-compatible mud “patches” that are sloughing off.  The proposed stucco finish shall be applied in an “adobe finish” manner giving the three walls a period appropriate adobe look.  

b.	OBJECTIVES: 
The exterior of the Fort has suffered from years of attempted permanent fixes and thus the walls present an unsightly patchwork of mud and adobe mixes in various states of disrepair.  This project will provide the Fort with a long term, low maintenance solution for the exterior walls so that Park personnel can focus on utilizing historic methods on the interior.  The exterior finish is important, especially color-wise, as that will become the standard for matching the actual adobe mix to be used throughout the rest of the Fort.  The Fort currently has test patches installed on the exterior with an appropriate finish and color that shall be used as the basis of design for the project.  

c.	BACKGROUND: 
Originally constructed in the early 1830s,  BEOL was mostly abandoned by the late 1800s and subsequently developed into a ruin.  The Fort was reconstructed utilizing historic methods in 1977 and immediately began experiencing problems with the adobe construction.  In the early 1980s, the exterior walls experienced a partial collapse and a decision was made to reconstruct the exterior course with CMU and stucco finish.  This resulted in an exterior with a variety of dissimilar material intersections and has proven to be a maintenance nightmare.  Attempts at re-mudding the wall have all failed due to a lack of bonding integrity between the applied exterior finish and the stucco surface.  This patchwork of failed stucco and mud finishes has given the Fort the appearance of a molting animal and does not present a pleasant visual experience for visitors to the Park.   The goal of this project is to apply a long lasting, historic looking finish thus freeing up Facility staff to concentrate on the interior of the Fort.  This project will require close coordination with Park Staff in order to achieve the desired results and ensure a long lasting and visually acceptable finish is achieved.  Test patches utilizing Omega ColorTek stucco finish with an acrylic admixture and the addition of fiberglass binders have proven desirable and shall be used as the basis of design. 
d.	SPECIFIC WORK / TASKS:

1.	Inspection of existing exterior stucco.
2.	Cleaning and prepping surface of exterior walls.  This will include removal of numerous instances of adobe and mud material applied in the course of normal maintenance.  
3.	Application of two to three test patches to ensure color and texture are correct.  The BEOL Facility Manager shall approve the test patch which shall be used on the exterior wall.
4.	Stucco the exterior surface (approximately 7,500 SF) with the approved stucco mixture.  The stucco shall be applied in an adobe finish style in order to give the exterior walls an historically accurate representation.
5.	Due to the unique shape of the walls at BEOL and the numerous instances of gun ports and other features unique to the fort, it is imperative that close coordination with the BEOL Facility Manager be maintained.  The stucco application shall lap around corners approximately 1 ½” and into and around gun ports 1 ½”.

(10) Period of Performance:  Estimated Period of performance is 9/18/2018 - 9/17/2019.

GOVERNMENT PCO POC IS JOHN FINLEY; CORRECT EMAIL IS JOHN.FINLEY@DLA.MIL (PLEASE NOTE THAT "JOHN.P.FINLEY@DLA.MIL" IS INCORRECT.) The Navy has mandated that near-term procurement of parts, consumable and repairable, for the P-8A Aircraft Program must be from either the Prime Contractor or from the OEM, or from an "Authorized Distributor" of either. An "Authorized Distributor" shall provide an official letter from either the Prime Contractor/OEM indicating that they are indeed an "Authorized Distributor" for the specific part number being procured. Without this letter, they shall not be considered eligible for this contract award. "Traceability" alone, of the part being proposed, to the Prime Contractor/OEM will be considered insufficient. This contract will only be awarded to the Prime Contractor, OEM, or to "Authorized Distributors" thereof. The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010]<BR><BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<BR><BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil<BR><BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement.<BR><BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas.

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010]<BR><BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-18-R-4448 for the execution of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44), hereinafter referred to collectively as "these CNO Availabilities", are planned for fiscal year 2019 (FY19). Each of these CNO Availabilities is scheduled to start in January 2019. Upon completion of these CNO Availabilities, each ship shall be capable of carrying out its respective mission with a reasonable expectation of maintaining a satisfactory condition of readiness until the next CNO-scheduled depot availability.</p>
<p>These CNO Availabilities will be solicited, competed, and awarded as private sector availabilities, using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The anticipated contracts, like all other CNO-scheduled depot availabilities, are considered supply contracts. The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the Fleet.</p>
<p>USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 8 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in August 2019.<br /><br />USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) depot modernization period (DMP) production period will be approximately 15 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in April 2020.</p>
<p>USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) dry-docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) production period will be approximately 13 months, beginning in January 2019 and completing in February 2020.</p>
<p>The scope of the procurement includes all labor, supervision, facilities, equipment, production, testing and quality assurance necessary to prepare for and accomplish these CNO Availabilities. These CNO Availabilities are expected to require a highly capable contractor, or contractors, with substantial facilities, including dry-dock(s), pier(s) and human resources capable of completing, coordinating and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair and modernization of the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51), USS BULKELEY (DDG 84), and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44).</p>
<p>The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires that full and open competition be used to the maximum extent practicable. 10 USC 7299a allows for the limitation of competition for "short term" availabilities (10 months or less) to the homeport, provided there is adequate competition. As the production periods for two of these CNO Availabilities are greater than 10 months, the USS BULKELEY (DDG 84) FY19 DMP and USS GUNSTON HALL (LSD 44) FY19 DSRA will be competed on a coast-wide basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. As the production period for one of these CNO Availabilities is less than 10 months, the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) FY19 DSRA will be competed only within the Norfolk VA homeport area.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 27 July 2018.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making&nbsp;three (3)&nbsp;single awards on or around 20 November 2018.</p>

<p>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION <br />(1) The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable. This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services. <br />(2) The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems. PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s). <br />(3) Quality: The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC). Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class. The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors: <br />1. Dark Blue: Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* <br />2. Purple: Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* <br />3. Green: Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* <br />4. Yellow: Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* <br />5. Red: Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group* <br />* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green. <br />(4) Delivery: Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries. On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue. (5) PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/. Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications. Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov. The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website. <br />(6) Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <br />The following Provisions and Clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certification Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items, 52.211-6 BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (AUG 1999); FAR 52.232-1 Payments, FAR 52.232-25 Prompt Payments, FAR 52.249-13 Failure to Perform, FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated By Reference and FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference.
