Inaddition, participants will have the opportunity to interact directly withsenior executives, project managers, and procurement personnel working forDOEand NNSA and its prime contractors; and, gain insight into Nuclear QualityAssurance program requirements applicable to both the DOE and commercialnuclear industry sectors.The purpose of this forum is two fold.  First, it will help ensure that allEMand NNSA sites have an adequate number of qualified nuclear and non-nuclearsuppliers for future projects and programs.  Second, it will provideinformation for suppliers regarding the needs of DOE projects and programsfortheir products and services in the years ahead.  Although DOE will belookingat companies that already have experience providing nuclear products andservices, opportunities do exist for new companies to supply DOE with thesetypes of products and services.  Such DOE experience would assist companiesinmarketing similar products and services to the commercial nuclear powerindustry as the commercial nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and overseasevolves.Who should attend?Suppliers who wish to provide their products and services to DOE for itsprojects and programs for both nuclear and non-nuclear applications.Services,for example, would include safety analysis, engineering, design,construction,professional, and administrative support.  Examples of products includeengineered items, piping, valves, pumps, heat exchangers, cables,electricalcomponents, and duct work.Executives and business development, sales, and marketing professional willfind the forum very informative and support potential expansion of theirbusinesses into the DOE and commercial nuclear markets.RegistrationThere is no registration fee for the event but you must register.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations capable of having in-house capability to develop methodologies and to perform in vivo rodent behavioral pharmacology for cocaine and other drug dependence disorders, using drug self-administration reinstatement models. The objectives of this contract are to determine the in vivo efficacy of novel compounds in animal models of relapse. This includes the following tests in animals trained to self-administer cocaine; (1) the ability of a test compound to block footshock- or other stressor-induced reinstatement of responding after a period of experimental extinction, (2) the ability of a test compound to block cocaine-priming-induced reinstatement of responding after a period of extinction, and (3) the ability of a test compound to block the effects of a conditioned cue (previously paired with cocaine) to reinstate responding for cocaine after a period of extinction.</p>
<p><br />This contract will be utilized by the NIDA, for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of potential drug abuse treatment medications in rat models of relapse to cocaine self-administration. Test compounds will be evaluated for potency and efficacy in blocking reinstatement to one or more of these stimuli, in models of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and possibly self-administration of other drugs of abuse. Test compounds will be shipped to the contractor for testing under blinded conditions with information regarding dose, vehicle and pretreatment time supplied by the NIDA project officer. The contractor will then evaluate the effects of the test compound for its effects to block reinstatement using a specific model and using standard protocols to be agreed upon in advance. Standardized, detailed reports with graphs will be prepared and submitted promptly to the program for each compound tested. Approximately 10-30 compounds per year will be evaluated using these protocols as specified by the NIDA project officer.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Data Buoy Center intends to negotiate only with Teledyne RD Instruments, Inc. of Poway, CA for the following:</p>
<p>0001:&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 Each 75 KHz Longranger with pressure sensor (2000m), standard housing, 356 MB memory</p>
<p>0002:&nbsp; 1 Each 1200 KHz ADCP with 2000m pressure sensor, 6000m depth rated housing and 256 MB memory</p>
<p>0003:&nbsp; 2 Each 1200 KHz ADCP with 200M Pressure Sensor, standard depth rated housing and 256 MB memory</p>
<p>0004:&nbsp; 2 Each 300 KHz ADCP with 200M Pressure Sensor, standard depth rated housing and 256 MB memory.</p>
<p>This sole source justification is for the procurement of ADCPs for the use in the Hawaii Munitions Dump Site Monitoring Project.&nbsp; This site is expected to have very low currents and will incorporate sites that are both shallow water and deep water in which the whole water column of data will need to be captured.&nbsp; These two sites are also expected to be deployed in a self deployed mode for an extended period of time 6 months at a time before servicing due to the costs of service vessels.&nbsp; For these reasons it is important for the sensors to be able to produce data with low noise relative to the flow (i.e. a small standard deviation in the returned samples) with a small power requirement to meet the extended deployment time frame.&nbsp; Presently, broadband technology meets these needs by having approximately 50x "clearer" data per single pin than the competing narrowband technology (i.e. a narrowband sensor would need to ping significantly more frequently to meet the same level of confidence in the data as a corresponding broadband sensor thereby consuming significantly more power).&nbsp; Presently, Teledyne RD Instrumnents is the only manufacturer of broadband technology ADCPs.&nbsp; Due to the fact that this data will be incorporated into a model, NDBC would like to ensure that the same technology and level of confidence is present in all of the sensors in the array.</p>

If the proposed concept meets program requirements, and funds are available, the Government will request a full technical and cost proposal.     
FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION - If the Government requests a full proposal, please note the following:  (1) Offerors shall complete the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) before submission of a proposal (http://www.bpn.gov/orca); (2) Offerors shall be current in the Central Contractor Registration (http://www.ccr.gov); (3) Offerors are advised to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7 if applicable with proposals; (4) Offerors shall review technical data rights clauses found under FAR 27 & DFARS 227 and propose technical data restrictions and reference applicable clauses; (5) Cost proposals shall be prepared in accordance with Table 15-2 under FAR 15.408, and remain valid for a period of 120 days; and (6) Work statements shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 35.005. The cost of preparation and response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract.  Offerors shall submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of their full proposal to: DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT (2.5.1.3.2), 21983 BUNDY ROAD, UNIT 7, BLDG 441, PATUXENT RIVER, MD 20670-1127. 
FULL PROPOSAL EVALUATION - Merit shall be determined based on: (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offerors ability to demonstrate feasibility (3) the offerors experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these criteria which are integral for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost.  Contract proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15 and 35.007.
CONTRACT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of procurement vehicles using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement assistance vehicles using DoDGARS, such as Grants/Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 or Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Selecting appropriate contract/agreement type is ultimately determined by the Contracting Officer.  Research may result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of the contract, which resulted from this BAA, and therefore will have met FAR/DFARS requirements and the Competition in Contracting Act. 
AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposal's technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. 
POINTS OF CONTACT - The offerors may e-mail Dr. James Sheehy (james.sheehy@navy.mil) for technical issues, and Ms. Krista Hayden (krista.hayden@navy.mil) for contractual guidance.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Enhanced Weapons Technology Enabling Capability for High Speed Component (HSC) products and Future Naval Capabilities Office solicits new technology demonstration of an enhanced RF radome and compact actuator for future high speed and time sensitive strike weapons.Research activities will involve design studies, analyses, component builds, laboratory tests and ultimately ground tests to evaluate electrical, structural and thermal performance capability.  These may include tests in an anechoic chamber, a structures laboratory, and a facility similar to the "T" range at China Lake.  Technical Readiness Level 6 is the goal for prototype demonstration in a relevant ground test environment at the completion of this effort. 	
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is directed solely to the radome task.   The radome is intended for integration into a future time sensitive strike weapon, to enable engagement of mobile targets at extended ranges.  Another BAA will be published at a later date for the compact actuator task under the same sponsorship.  
It is anticipated that up to $5.0M will be available over the next 4 years for the radome solicitation, but this is subject to appropriation and approval by ONR.  It is possible that multiple contracts will be awarded in late FY09 based on evaluation of the responders' potential to accomplish the program tasks.  It may be that an individual offeror will not have all the skills to execute the entire range of program tasks.  Contracts may be extended to those who have the expertise to tackle selective tasks as part of the overall requirements, but it would be to their advantage to put forth a plan coordinated with other vendors for the completion of the entire effort.  Teaming of industry-to-industry, industry-to-academia, and others along with government involvement may present an advantage in some cases to provide the needed expertise, addressing the wide range of requirements and challenges of this program.   Hereafter, participants are noted as offeror team and government team in this solicitation.  
This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). A formal request for proposal (RFP). Solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.
The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAWCWD reserves the right to select for award and fund all, some, or none of the white papers/proposals submitted in response to this announcement. NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (and any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. 

Awards will be in the form of contracts. Therefore, proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the FAR.

If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate i! n a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and four one-year option years.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the option years to extend the contract term.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $50,000,000.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $25,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $25,000 and $500,000,00! 0.  Estimated date of contract award is June 2009.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for the design of medical and/or dental facilities in tropical environments, similar to Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for the design of medical and/or dental facilities in tropical environments, similar to Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts an! d principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-E's quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this Contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor; and (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A! -E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  For selection criteria (1) and (2), firms and staff with only medical or only dental facility design professional qualifications or specialized recent experience/technical competence will be less favorably considered than firms and staff with both medical and dental facility design qualifications and experience/technical competence.  In addition, the following medical and dental facility projects will be more favorably considered: DoD medical and dental facilities designed in accordance with Medical Military Facilities design criteria, and medical and dental facilities designed for tropical areas similar to Hawaii and Guam.  For selection criterion (3), the Government will also evaluate each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection!  outcome.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project.  The Government will also evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Informati! on on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 5 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB, VOSB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 09 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 77.51% to SB, 16.18% to SDB, 14.53% to!  WOSB, 1.42% to HUBZone SB and 0.14 % to SDVOSB.  If the offeror is unable to meet the minimum targets, an explanation should be provided, stating what actions were taken to satisfy the minimum target and how such actions failed to meet the objective.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract or meet the NAVFAC small business subcontracting goals, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as a HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor!  Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  For Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Certifications, effective October 1, 2008, the offeror may accept a self-certification from its SDB subcontractors as defined in 13 CFR 124.1002.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract, refer to FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008).  Failure to register in the DOD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the DOD CCR Website at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission proce! ss.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.  Refer to FAR 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (JAN 2006).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division(NSWC PCD) intends to issue a firm fixed price sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedure to Themis Computer Incorporated, 3185 Laurelview Court, Fremont, CA 94538 for the acquisition of nine (9) RES-32DCX Rugged Enterprise Servers (PN: 535-L1J262811-5AW0000) to support fleet repair parts.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 was designed around the Themis server. Themis Computer Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of these servers.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PCD has been assigned as the In-Service En! gineering Activity and tasked to procure spares in support of the Naval inventory control point in order to support fleet failures; so, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers. The NAICS code is 334111 with size standard of 1,000 employees.  FSC code 7021.  Expected delivery date on or around 1 April 2009 to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.

Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use.  These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration.  Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command intends to award on a non-competitive basis to Quantum3D Inc., 6330 San Ignacio BLVD, San Jose CA, 95119, a commercial contract for the purchase of five (5), Part# 1090-3500-05 Thermite TVC 2.0 MDL 3500 computers  This acquisition will be procured in accordance FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Subpart 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items).<BR><BR>AATD on a non-competitive basis is procuring Thermite Computers for use in conjunction with the VUIT-2 System on the Kiowa Warrior OH-58D. The Thermite, TVC-2.0 Model 3500 computer is a critical component of the Kiowa VUIT-2 system, and is the only compatible system that has been tested and validated with the VUIT-2 electronics suite and currently substantiated with an air worthiness release for use in the VUIT System on the AH64D aircraft. Quantum3D's Thermite TVC 2.0 MDL 3500 computers compatibility with the existing electronics package makes them the only viable source capable of providing the computers necessary within the agressive schedule and without significant duplication of cost. Procurement of these components on an other than a sole-source basis will jeopardize critical deployment schedules, and further degrade force protection and readiness multiplying already serious risks of personnel casualties and loss or damage to aviation assets. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334111.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that will be considered.  Proposals submitted in response to this notice are due no later than February 13, 2009, 1:00 p.m. EST.

<p>4) Anticipated capital cost range</p>
<p>5) Anticipated waste fuel (feed) stock and anticipated waste fuel tons per day</p>
<p>6) Number of years the WTE plant would need to be in operation to make this endeavor economical and feasible</p>
<p>7) Any other general information or comments offered</p>
<p>All information provided will be treated as procurement sensitive.</p>

<DESC>U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP) LAND BORDER OPERATIONAL AWARENESS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Further, CBP offers no assurance that any solicitation will result from the information provided in response to this RFI.

BACKGROUND

CBP currently has a number of management systems and executive information systems that report on CBPs internal operation and performance and are used to provide CBP management a series of dashboards.  These systems:
 Identify and implement appropriate metrics for a CBP-wide operational awareness capability similar to ComStat system used by many police departments in a phased approach
 Provide a uniform mechanism for timely reporting of a total of 131 different operational measures covering the subject areas of Cargo, Passenger, Enforcement, Antiterrorism, Currency, Border Violence, and Seizures. 
 Cover the entire CBP enterprise including the Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Border Patrol (OBP) and Air & Marine Division(AMD).
These systems are used by CBP to both report the level of congestion at the Ports of Entry (POEs) and to predict at which ports and when congestion will occur.  Severe congestion at POEs, particularly at the land borders, can cause major economic impacts.  CBP is able to accurately predict congestion at the air and sea POEs because both air and sea carriers are required to file passenger manifests prior to their arrival at the POE and thus, CBP knows when and where they will arrive.  There is no such prior notice requirement for persons planning to cross a land border in a vehicle.  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from industry as to effective approaches that CBP might be able to employ that will allow CBP to predict when congestion is likely to occur at a land border crossing.
CBP is conducting market research to gain a greater understanding of the full range of candidate technologies that either individually or collectively could allow CBP to estimate the number of vehicles approaching the US border and their rate speed. 

DESCRIPTION OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):

CBP believes that given information related to the traffic flows  e.g., number of vehicles, speed of vehicles, road conditions, etc., it will be able to reasonably predict when congestion will occur before the lanes at the POE actually begin to back up.  It is the purpose of this RFI to identify technologies and approaches that could be used to acquire information relating to the flow of traffic on the approximately ten (10) miles of roads leading up to the US POE.  CBP is requesting information from industry as to passive approaches to determining the number and speed of vehicles approaching the Northern US land border POEs.   CBP believes that almost any aspect of the moving vehicle may be used to detect its position and speed.  CBP is agnostic as to the technology or technologies that are used to meet this requirement, and just because CBP has identified some technologies that may be able to support this requirement, does not imply that CBP believes that these are the only, or even the best, technologies to meet this requirement.  Technologies that CBP is aware of include, but are not limited to:
 Photographic evidence of the passage of a vehicle (e.g., License Plate Readers [LPRs])
 Radar (e.g., speed sensors)
 Magnetic detectors (e.g., loops installed in the roadway)
 Radio emissions (e.g., Bluetooth or other radio emissions)
CBP will require technologies that can provide the needed information for vehicles traveling at speed up to ten (10) miles from the POE as well as be able to determine the number of vehicles in the lanes at the POE and at points in between.  While CBP is agnostic as to the technology proposed, because of privacy concerns, it is critical that whatever technology is proposed not transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) regarding the occupants of the car.
In addition, to an interest in technologies that might be used to estimate vehicle numbers and speed, CBP is also interested in approaches to:
 Installing one or more of these technologies in Canada
 Operating the technical solution
 Collecting and managing the potentially multiple streams of information that will be collected
 Transmitting the collected information to CBP
 Integrating the collected information into CBP systems for display in CBP management dashboards
It would not necessarily be in CBPs interest to own, install, operate, maintain, or support the system.  Therefore, CBP is also interested in industry input into approaches that might allow CBP use of the required information without CBP involvement in the installation, operation, maintenance, or support of any data collection, analysis, and integration that may be required.

HOW TO RESPOND:
 
Information provided in response to this RFI must be submitted no later than 14 calendar days from the date of posting, in the form of a white paper.  Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the U.S. Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services.  Proprietary information should not be included in the RFI response.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  
Interested parties shall provide the following information when responding to this RFI:
1. Concept  What is the private sectors perception of the viability of this initiative?  Is there interest in providing this capability?
2. Architecture  Please provide an architectural diagram showing the major elements of the solution including all types of sensors that are included as part of the solution as well as all communication and processing elements.
3. Data Protection  What are the best approaches for obtaining data while protecting confidential and proprietary data?  How can CBP be assured that no PII will be transmitted?
4. Technology  What are the projected hardware, software and communications capabilities and capacity needed to support this effort?
5. Time Frame  How long would it take to establish a pilot capability?  What is a reasonable time frame for establishing fully operational capabilities (i.e, solution at all Northern Border ports and lanes)?  
6. Partnerships and Team Make-up  What are the most likely private sector entities to respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP)?
7. Government Involvement  What support or other involvement will be needed from CBP, if any in making arrangements to install this capability in Canada?  How will the cooperation of the appropriate Canadian government entities be obtained?
8. Costs  What would be the estimated cost to implement a pilot for a POE.  What would be the estimated fixed cost for the POE and what would be the variable costs for each lane where the pilot is implemented?
9. Business Model  What type of business model would be most appropriate for this effort?
10. Security Protocols  What security technologies and standards should be applied to private sector entities for participation in BWT?
11. Extensions  Is this a scalable solution (i.e., if CBP deems additional information beneficial at a later date, what other types of information could be captured, would this incur additional cost and what type and magnitude of costs would be incurred?)
12. Other  What other information and ideas does the private sector offer for pursuing this initiative?

<DESC>The US Forest Service is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as part of market research for technical professional services for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data services.
The RFI number is AG-84N8-S-09-0019 and is to determine the industry interest and capabilities. This is a request for information announcement only.  This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.  The US Forest Service reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future activities.

The US Forest Service is seeking/targeting qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, SBA 8(a) Disadvantaged Small Businesses or any other small business that have the capability and capacity to complete the requirements stated below in this RFI.

The performance specification consists of both a classified and unclassified portion which states the requirements to be met with this recovery vehicle.  The procedures to receive both sections of the specification are outlined below. <BR><BR>If the performance requirements create an inconsistency or if two or more requirements cannot be achieved, because some aspects are mutually exclusive, you are asked to identify the issue and recommend how it might best be resolved.  An alternative approach may be that if the indicated performance parameters are not achievable with a single vehicle at a reasonable weight, interested parties may address how the capabilities may be achieved using multiple platforms.  Request that all responders keep in mind the impacts from performing recovery operations in mountainous terrain with poorly developed roadways.<BR><BR>It is important to understand that an acquisition strategy has not yet been developed for this requirement and it has yet to be determined whether the strategy will be a full and open competition or be limited to the five current MRAP original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).    <BR><BR>In order to provide comments to the Government, your firm must request the detailed information on the recovery vehicle, including the classified and unclassified portions of the performance specification, by sending your facility clearance information, and the name of your security officer, along with their security information to:<BR><BR>Ms. P.

The CTA Radar System will be required to include 360 degree azimuth coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for future growth.  It will need to accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage pattern to permit more effective detection and counter-battery.  The CTA Radar System will provide improved operational and physical functionality over the existing AN/TPQ-36(V) 8, with a smaller footprint than the existing AN/TPQ-37 Radar System.  The enhanced capabilities of the CTA Radar System will provide Warfighters with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  It will detect in-flight projectiles and determine and communicate firing point locations of mortars, artillery, rockets and missiles.  Additionally, it will be deployable and capable of operating in various terrain and climatic conditions, in accordance with the performance requirement which can be found in a restricted library located on the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) under the heading Solicitation Number W15P7T-09-R-T005.  <BR><BR>Product Manager, Radars (PM, Radars) has identified current and future needs for CTA Radar Systems, spare and repair parts, and engineering and technical support services.

<DESC>NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION:   MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES AND DIAGNOSTICS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS B

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers and devices for studies of patients with well-characterized chronic hepatitis B.

INTRODUCTION:  Chronic hepatitis B is a result of a persistent infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a major cause of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Chronic infection with HBV affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans and it is the underlying reason for approximately 10 percent of liver transplants done in the United States.  There are currently seven different agents licensed and approved for use as therapeutic agents in patients with chronic hepatitis B.  However, there remain many questions regarding the use of these agents such as:  Which patients with chronic hepatitis B should be treated?  Which agent or agents would be most efficacious?  Should agents be used alone or in combination with other therapies?  For how long should the agents be used?  What viral, biochemical or clinical markers should be used to monitor success or failure of therapy?  Currently available therapies are effective for the treatment of patients with advanced disease due to hepatitis B, however it is not clear whether these therapies effect the long-term natural history of mild and moderate forms of chronic HBV infection.  A large proportion of patients with chronic HBV infection appear to have no symptoms or signs of liver disease and have minimal disease activity as assessed by biochemical and histological features; it is not clear whether these patients would benefit from treatment.  At present, the criteria for treatment of hepatitis B are controversial.  

In response to the challenges surrounding management of chronic hepatitis B, the NIDDK established a Hepatitis B Research Network (Hepatitis B Network) in October 2008.  The overarching goals of this Network are to create a large database of patients of all ages with chronic HBV infection and allow for clinical investigation into the pathogenesis of liver injury, the natural history of infection and long-term antiviral therapy in different categories of patients.  This study will include patients with the full spectrum of clinical severity of disease, from patients with the inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier state, to patients with mild but active HBV infection (immune tolerant), to patients with typical hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic hepatitis B as well as negative chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg), and patients with cirrhosis.  The Hepatitis B Network will be charged with conducting investigational, natural history as well as therapeutic studies and ancillary studies of etiology and pathogenesis. 

BACKGROUND:  The Network is composed of Clinical Centers throughout North America with expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, management, and conduct of clinical trials and will be charged with enrolling aproximately1,000 patients over a 7 year period; an Immunology Center with expertise in the role of the immune system in the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis B and in developing and performing state-of-the-art immunological assays on patients enrolled in protocols; and a Data Coordinating Center will assist in maintaining the database and be responsible for the quality and accuracy of the data and adherence to regulatory requirements.  

The current thirteen Clinical Centers Clinical Center Principal Investigators (or corresponding Principal Investigator for multiple Principle Investigator applications) are (in alphabetical order): Robert Carithers (University of Washington), Adrian Di Bisceglie (Saint Louis University), Michael Fried (University of North Carolina), Marc Ghany (Clinical Center, NIH), Steven Han (University of California Los Angeles), E. Jenny Heathcote (University of Toronto), W. Ray Kim (Mayo Clinic), Daryl Lau (Beth Israel Hospital), William Lee (University of Texas Southwestern), Anna Lok (University of Michigan), Mitchell Shiffman (Virginia Commonwealth University), Kathleen Schwarz (Johns Hopkins University), and Norah Terrault (University of California San Francisco).  The Immunology Center Principal Investigator is Kyong-Mi Chang (University of Pennsylvania) and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) Principal Investigator is Steven Belle (University of Pittsburgh).

A virology testing center will be established in the future and charged with performing routine testing for hepatitis B markers, including HBV DNA levels and HBV genotypes.  In addition to collecting clinical patient data, the Hepatitis B Network will submit liver biopsy, serum, DNA and other samples to a central repository.  These resources will allow for many ancillary studies on the natural history, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of hepatitis B and will provide multiple opportunities for collaboration with industry in areas such as genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, imaging, and biomarkers for disease activity and hepatic fibrosis, the determinants of progression and severity of chronic hepatitis B.  The Hepatitis B Network will also be charged with developing prospective controlled trials to evaluate important issues in treatment, such as (but not limited to) the role of combination versus monotherapy using nucleoside analogues and the role of peginterferon in the management of HBeAg-positive and -negative chronic hepatitis B.  

STUDY GOALS:  In establishing the Hepatitis B Research Network, the NIDDK wishes to consider the potential application of diagnostics and therapeutics for patients of all ages with chronic hepatitis B.  The overall goal of the Hepatitis B Network will be to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with chronic hepatitis B using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of chronic hepatitis B and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database on chronic hepatitis B patients including clinical information as well as liver, serum and DNA samples.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with the Hepatitis B Research Network by providing novel or currently approved therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers or devices for investigational studies as well as randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of approaches to therapy, which could include: (1) assays for HBV DNA levels as well as determination of nucleotide sequence or special tests for genotyping, identification of viral mutants; (2) assays for hepatitis B markers including levels of HBsAg, HBeAg, and titers of antibodies to hepatitis B; (3) non-invasive markers, devices, or imaging tests that might reflect state of viral replication, disease activity and degree of hepatic fibrosis that is currently only assessable by liver biopsy; (4) biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in these high risk patients, using approaches such as proteomics, serum tumor markers and imaging tests, (5) antiviral agents for hepatitis B including nucleoside analogues, combinations of nucleoside analogues and peginterferon; (6) novel antiviral agents that might have yet to be proven effective in chronic hepatitis B and might be used in pilot clinical trials such as small molecule inhibitors of other steps in the HBV replicative cycle, molecular therapies aimed at HBV DNA such as siRNAs, and immunological therapies such as therapeutic vaccines or cytokines/anticytokines; (7) novel hepatoprotective therapies that might ameliorate the disease or enlist natural antiviral activity such as anti-oxidants, immune stimulants and cytokines; (8) complementary therapies such as herbal medicines that might have direct antiviral activity; (9) genetic markers or genetic or genomic analyses that might allow insights into factors that determine the course and outcome of HBV infection or responses to therapy, and (10) any other tests, assays, diagnostics, devices, instruments, or therapeutics that are consistent with the research objectives of the Hepatitis B Research Network.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.

<DESC>THIS SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER FOR PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME. THERE IS A DRAFT SOLICITATION AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE. The Government may consider comments and inquiries while preparing the final plans and specs; however, the Government is not seeking comments and may not provide responses to inquiries. A solicitation will be issued on or about 27 April 2009 with proposals due on or about 11 June 2009.<BR><BR>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit on a Sole Source basis, The Central Control System Components including: security cameras and alarm panel {Mobotix IP cameras and Ademeco alarm provide constant monitoring of pumps and control building security against unauthorized access), web-browser based remote telemetry unit (RTU) {Semaphore's T-BOX modular RTU system is an IP-based telemetry product that completely integrates SCADA, control, and communications functionality into a single package}, RTU enclosure and components, monitoring well water level sensors (InSitu) and groundwater dataloggers (Campbell Scientific), and installation oversight of instrumentation (monitoring well groundwater specialized flowmeters capable of measuring groundwater velocity and direction) for the L-30 Seepage Management Pilot Project. This project is currently being designed and cost shared with the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD).  The duration of the pilot project will be for two years. <BR><BR>The components listed above have been specifically selected due to their performance interoperability as a part of the central control system.  Substitution of similar components would be considered a financial risk to the government as the components may not function as reliably or effectively as the standardized components which have been specifically selected for their capabilities, thoroughly tested, and have proven themselves in years of service.<BR><BR>The purpose of the L-31 North (L-30) Seepage Management Pilot Project (SMPP) is to identify, test, and determine the relative effectiveness of seepage management technologies in order to recommend features to control groundwater flow and levee seepage from Everglades National Park. Work will include the installation and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with an injection/extraction well system, located near the barrier, adjacent to a sheet pile window.  The barrier will have dimensions of approximately 60-80 feet in depth and approximately 1,000 feet in length. The magnitude of construction is $5-10M. The work is in Miami-Dade County, Florida.  The anticipated dollar amount of sole source components is $350K.<BR><BR>Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Claurice Dingle at 904-232-3736 or email at claurice.m.dingle@usace.army.mil.

<p><strong>THIS ACQUISITION IS SET ASIDE AS 100% TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS.</strong></p>
<p>See attached solicitation notice FA8125-09-Q-0033 for item details, shipping, delivery, and quantities.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for brand name items per Justification and Approval:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: normal; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">V.</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: windowtext; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Items must be the manufacturer and part numbers that have been requested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's critical to have uniform lighting throughout the production shops to eliminate dark shadows and create safety hazards to equipment operators. The existing lighting system was designed to work with the above part numbers and will not require re-wiring the building. Some of the parts above will be used to repair the existing fixtures. This Ballast, fixture, and lamp combination above will deliver the most combined light output and energy savings. This is a brand name request and not a sole source, therefore this is available in the commercial market place and available to any vendor. Building 9001 is engineered to use the Hubbel lighting system, part number CH-40E5-M-EUCFB-C4HL5-LRI-TR16.&nbsp;Bldg <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>9001 was pre-wired to add additional light fixtures (on the existing circuits) as identified above and will not require extensive re-wiring. However to use a different brand and achieve uniform light distribution the electricians would have to remove all the existing fixtures, conduit, and wiring and start over, in lieu of just supplementing the existing lighting by adding additional fixtures.</span></p>

<DESC>***THIS NOTICE IS BEING POSTED AS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION 5.203(2)***

The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a series of on-line market research surveys.  The requirement will be a 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code for the requirement is 541910 with a size standard of 7.0 million dollars.  Competition for this requirement is hereby limited to those firms that meet this restriction.

Synopsis of Requirement:  The Scope of Work of the solicitation is hereby provided verbatim: quote, the contractor shall provide online market research survey services so that the government can receive feedback on public and citizen attitudes, opinions, preferences, and service expectations regarding government programs and services.  The survey services will include assistance with development of questions, dissemination of online surveys, analysis of survey response and reports that provide detail explanation of the results.   The Contractor shall provide all information technology infrastructure necessary to conduct the surveys and analyze the resulting data. In order to ensure statistically valid sampling from those segments of population that are not connected to the internet, the contractor shall provide alternative means of collecting surveys via telephone, provision of computer to households or other means.   While GSA will be surveying citizens on a variety of topics and issues that will affect all government agencies it is anticipated that other Federal agencies will utilize the contract as well.  However, all task orders will be placed directly by GSA.  The Government may require demographic weighting different from that specified under task 5.1 based on survey needs.  In such a case, task order pricing and technical proposals would be negotiated on an ad-hoc basis, end quote.

The list of objectives of the solicitation is hereby provided verbatim: quote, the objective of this requirement is to provide for a series of online market research surveys that: (i) understand citizen communication channel preferences and service level expectations for receiving information and services from the government; (ii) determine attitudes regarding trust in government, privacy and security of citizen information, and other relevant policy and program information that will enhance customer service e.g., do citizens really want to use Facebook and/or YouTube to get government information?  Do citizens expect the government to use Facebook and/or YouTube to disseminate information?; (iii) Improve the service that the federal government provides to citizens online and through other service delivery channels such as phone, email, print, and emerging technologies; (iv) reduce costs and duplication of efforts by consolidating the collection of citizen research across government; (v) bring additional awareness throughout the federal community regarding the importance of customer service. (vi) Improve public opinion on governments responsiveness to citizen needs; and (vii) enhance awareness of government services and programs.

This solicitation will result in the award of a single indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract.  he Government will guarantee that each awardee will receive a minimum order amount of $60,000.00 in aggregate task orders. The maximum value of all task orders placed shall not exceed $2,500,000.00. 

Award(s) will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal provides the best-value solution to the Government. The Government will combine the results of the technical evaluation for each offerors proposal with the results of the corresponding price evaluation to identify offer that provides the Government with the best-value solution. The resultant contract will have a base period of one year, with four (4), one-year option periods.

Procedure for submitting questions: Interested parties should submit a complete list of questions concerning this solicitation to the Contracting Officer, via e-mail, no later than 4:00 p.m. (EST) on Friday, February 13, 2009. The e-mail address to use is: bob.corey@gsa.gov. All questions will be analyzed and the appropriate answers will be prepared. Once this process is complete, an amendment to the solicitation will be issued listing all questions received from all interested parties with their corresponding answers. Questions with answers from each interested party will be grouped together, but the identity of the questioners will not be revealed. Instead, the format that will be used is as follows: the first set of questions will be shown as Q.1.1, Q.1.2 etc., the next set of questions will be shown as Q.2.1, Q.2.2 etc.

Proposals in response to this solicitation are due by 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on Thursday, February 26, 2009.

Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing electronically via e-mail to both of the individuals listed above no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Wednesday, February 11, 2009.

For this full and open competition, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) License B and/or Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Offerors facilities is required.

In order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a closed herd without having come from auction or having co-mingled with other cattle after January 1, 2009. Furthermore, the cattle shall be accumulated together for at least seven (7) calendar days prior to departure for Plum Island. 

The Offeror shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary. The veterinary examination also will verify that each head of cattle has been given the appropriate antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Offeror, each animal must be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Offeror shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum:

 general information identifying the animal by number/ID;
 the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island;
 breed;
 gender;
 age or birth date range;
 date (de)horned, weaned, and castrated (if applicable);
 the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic (Ivermectin), anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs;
 any other tests and corresponding results; and
 any other interesting and important information.

The Offeror must send these health papers, reports, and certificates via e-mail to the DHS PIADC points of contact listed above no later than seven (7) calendar days PRIOR to departure for Orient Point.

Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

 Holsteins;
 castrated males;
 healthy with no overt signs of disease;
 free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
 polled or dehorned;
 tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
 free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last 90 calendar days (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

 the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e. pink) tongues;
 the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
 the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

Following notification of award, the Offeror (referred to after award as the Supplier) shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle and signed/official hardcopies of all corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 26, 2009. 

The Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals are not overly stressed and fatigued, namely as a result of prolonged transportation (for instance, not greater than 450 miles), which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Transportation of these animals includes, but is not limited to the primary enclosures to be used during the transportation of live animals, food and water requirements, care in transit, terminal facilities, and handling  in particular, shelter from cold weather, and shall be in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations (see http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm) with an emphasis on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9, Chapter 1, Subchapter A - Animal Welfare: Part 3 Standards.

(50F.) and such live animals shall not be subjected to surrounding air temperatures which fall below 7.2C. (45F.), and which shall be measured and read in the manner prescribed in  3.141 of this part, for a period of more than 45 minutes unless such animals are accompanied by a certificate of acclimation to lower temperatures as prescribed in  3.136(c).

Upon arrival on February 26, 2009, utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle. In the event that more that one vehicle is needed for the transportation of these 50 head of cattle, the Supplier must inform the DHS PIADC points of contact listed above in advance.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle or the monetary amount of cattle including a prorated monetary amount of health papers and transportation for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

All proposals shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal referencing number W912EQ-09-Q-0009 and e-mailed for sent to the Point of Contact below no  later than 12 February 2009 @ 11:00 am Central Standard Time (CST).  In addition, all technical questions concerning this requirement must be should be emailed to the point of contact no later than COB 10 February 2009.  <BR><BR><BR>Statement of Work<BR><BR>The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment required to perform work that may include, but not be limited to, the following work items in accordance with specific task orders issued by the Contracting officer:<BR><BR>1. The Contractor shall, within 30 days after date of award, conduct surveys (qualitative and/or quantitative) in a manner agreed upon in each task order to determine the presence/absence of endangered mussels, provide density estimates of endangered mussels, translocate populations of endangered mussels, and provide other services that may be required by the Memphis District relating to endangered mussel populations.  Variables such as weather, flood events or other unforeseen circumstances may delay implementation of work without penalty to the contractor.  <BR><BR>Task 1.<BR><BR>a.  Quantitative sampling of approximately 5.2 miles of Rivervale Outlet Ditch, located north of Marked Tree, Arkansas.  The average width of this ditch is 80 feet.  The Memphis District has proposed to cleanout portions of this ditch.  The federally endangered freshwater mussel Potamilus capax was recently collected in this ditch during a preliminary reconnaissance survey. Quantitative sampling will include a sufficient number of replicate samples to adequately estimate population densities of both T&E species and non-endangered mussels. The report shall include number and location (GPS data) of all P. capax collected during the survey and a population estimate for P. capax for the area surveyed.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Task 2.<BR><BR>The Memphis District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to build a 1,640 cfs pump station to divert water from the White River near DeValls Bluff in Monroe County Arkansas for agricultural irrigation purposes.  An Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Assessment have previously been completed on the overall Grand Prairie Area Demonstration Project (GPADP), and a previous study conducted in 2001 by Miller et al., found no endangered freshwater mussels within the survey reach.  However, due to the length of time since that survey, and additional concerns regarding alterations to current velocities, changes in water elevations, and other potential hydrologic impacts, an additional study is needed.   <BR><BR>Study Area:  The study area for this survey will encompass two mussel beds in the vicinity of DeValls Bluff, Arkansas.  Figure 1 shows the location of the survey reach. <BR>The two mussel beds in the White River are approximately 625 M2 (upstream bed) and 1500 M2 (downstream bed).<BR><BR>Objective:  The objective of this study will be to conduct quantitative and qualitative surveys on two mussel beds in the vicinity of the proposed GPADP pump station. Information gathered in this effort will be used during the project monitoring process to determine whether project operations are impacting the mussel community in the survey area.  A previous study (Harris 1989) found the endangered Lampsilis abrupta present in the downstream mussel bed.  The initial monitoring effort (2005) found evidence of Potamilus capax (shells) but encountered no live specimens.  <BR><BR>Methodology and Sites:  An inter-agency team made up of Bill Posey (AGFC), Joe Krystofik and Chris Davidson (USFWS), Corps personnel, and a private industry malacologist met at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas and determined the sampling methods and areal extent of the survey.  Both quantitative and qualitative sampling will be conducted on the known mussel beds (Figure1). <BR><BR>Quantitative surveys will be conducted using a 0.25 meter quadrant.  At least 1% of the total area of each bed will be quantitatively sampled.  Each sample will consist of all material within the quadrant to a depth of 15 centimeters.  This material will be transported to the surface, processed through a sieve, and all unionids will be collected.   Mussels will be identified, enumerated, and returned to the approximate point of collection.  The lengths of the beds will be measured and the upstream and downstream limits of the beds will be delineated in decimal degrees using a GPS unit.  Spot dives will be conducted on the beds in order to estimate species richness.  At least fifteen, 15-minute dives will be conducted on each mussel bed.<BR><BR><BR><BR>		<BR> <BR>Figure 1.  Location of the mussel beds near DeValls Bluff, Arkansas. <BR>(IMAGE CAN BE VIEWED AT MEMPHIS DISTRICT HOMEPAGE--WWW.MVM.USACE.ARMY.MIL)<BR><BR>General Contractor Requirements.<BR><BR>1.Coordination:  To the maximum extent possible, coordination will be done by telephone.   When in the field, the Contractor will submit a daily status report and dive schedule for the next day.  A safety meeting will be conducted prior to the start of work.

<a href="mailto:ashley.taylor@amedd.army.mil">European Regional Contracting Office</a>
<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Europe Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the countries Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Supplies-Splints in all sizes as detailed in the technical criteria below.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. <BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Health Center Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health and Birthing Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, and U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process: vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II; where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and/or samples.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PV for the Europe Region (Owens and Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program.  This RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding the DSCP PV program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR><BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products and Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Casting Supplies-Splints, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $263,758.62.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final selection recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.  <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative MUST E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your e-mail will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain their best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the best tiered-pricing discounts off of the company DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process: Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendor responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendor information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The following eight (8) equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative and vendors MUST provide a response to the following criteria by the closing date of the FBO:<BR>1.	Vendors must be able to provide a full product line of Casting Supplies-Splints to include but not limited to fiberglass and plaster splinting systems (ready made); pre-cut and cut-to-fit in a variety of sizes that are used in all patient care settings in the Europe Region military treatment facilities (MTF).  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>	a. Usage items:<BR>		1) Splint Fiberglass Roll Sizes: 2, 3, & 4inW x 15ftL.<BR>		2) Splint Fiberglass Pre-Cut Sizes: 4 or 5inW x 30inL.<BR>		3) Splint Plaster Roll 15ply Sizes: 2, 3, & 4inW x 20ft.<BR>	b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied and product literature in 	response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and 	styles. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be 	disqualified in Phase I. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Casting Supplies-Splints product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: _______.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (PV), Owens and Minor, for Casting Supplies-Splints distribution in the Europe Region.  Vendor must provide the four digit Owens and Minor code with initial submittal. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format within 14 days of request by the TRBO.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for their Casting Supplies-Splints product lines including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ.  Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendors must identify the types of educational tools, materials or staff training that the company provides for Casting Supplies-Splints in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.	Vendors must indicate that they agree to ship samples necessary for evaluation to the TRBO by close of business (COB) within 14 calendar days of request via United States Postal Service (USPS) eliminating delays that occur with Custom Offices in Europe.  Proof of vendor shipment (copy of the PS Form 2976-A with stamped date) via USPS prior to the established deadline must be scanned and sent via digitally signed e-mail to the TRBO.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical Evaluation Process<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO via USPS to the following APO address: Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization, Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108), CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship samples for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO Point of Contact (POC) verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>The non-sterile samples: Splints for the eight (8) MTFs and the TRBO to be provided as follows:<BR>1.	Splints: Fiberglass, Pre-Cut size 4inW x 15ftL, one (1) box per each MTF and TRBO.<BR>2.	Splints: Plaster, 15 ply, size 4inW x 20ftL, one (1) roll per each MTF and TRBO.<BR>NOTE:  Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  The TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>3.  To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>4. The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The CPT will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are:  one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.00 depending on the location of any break in vendor average scores (i.e., a gap between vendor average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  The criteria below will be evaluated one (1) time by each participating MTF.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR>1.	Product Performance  The pre-formed (plaster or fiberglass) splint is moldable for precise fit providing the necessary support.<BR>a.	The pre-formed (plaster or fiberglass) splint must be moldable to allow for exact fit and smooth finish immobilizing the body part.<BR>b.	During and after application, the evaluator will assess the pre-cut (plaster or fiberglass) splint visualizing the precise fit and firm support for the affected body part.<BR>2.	Patient Safety  The application of the splinting system can be done with a wrinkle-free finish eliminating pressure points.<BR>a.	The splinting system must be wrinkle-free.  Wrinkles in materials cause pressure points which can cause skin break down and/or injury to the supported limb.<BR>b.	The evaluator, during and after the splint application, will visually inspect the splint for any presence of wrinkles.<BR>	The two product items, fiberglass and plaster splints, will be evaluated by using the approved clinical/performance criteria as above.  The two product item evaluation forms will use the following clinical/performance criteria.<BR>	 		a. Fiberglass cast pre-formed (ready made or cut-to-fit) splint  Criteria 1 and 2<BR>			b. Plaster cast pre-formed (ready made or cut-to-fit) splint  Criteria 1 and 2<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.) The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain their best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  <BR><BR>Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the CPT.  The CPT will then make a recommendation to the TPRB with the selected vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Region. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more clinically equal, price will become more important. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: 1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. 2) Impact of Unmatched Lines; i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor? 3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR>Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code (541611) is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total 100% small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that discussions after initial offer(s) is/are provided are not necessary. 

This announcement is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for expert consultant services to assist the Food and Drug Administrations Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in meeting Paperwork Reduction Act compliance requirements.  This requirement identified as FDA-SOL-09-1052493, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13 for the following statement of work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Purpose   

The purpose of this project is to ensure that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) complies with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).  The PRA requires that federal agencies estimate and justify the time and economic burden placed on those entities asked to supply information to the government and applies to CDRH documents that involve a collection of information by those outside the Federal government.  PRA is implicated in many CDRH documents, which may include guidance documents, regulations and letters to device manufacturers.  The PRA process is complex and involves numerous steps.  Steps include drafting and submission of an information collection request (ICR), which includes a Supporting Statement that addresses between 18 and 23 specific issues and a worksheet that certifies that the ICR complies with the PRA; drafting and publishing two Federal Register notices requesting public comment on the agencys intent to collect the information, and working with the Office of Management and Budget to resolve any questions or concerns about the collection.  CDRH has developed a list of 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, and a general list of guidance documents to be revised, many of which may involve the collection of information.  The list of guidances that the agency is considering publishing in FY2009 can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/agenda/fy09.html.  CDRH also frequently develops documents in response to emerging public health concerns that involve information collections.  Under the PRA, persons do not need to respond to a collection of information unless the collection displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.  CDRH needs to ensure that it is able to expeditiously identify information collections in its documents and, if necessary, obtain approval from OMB. 

Background

CDRH issues numerous documents related to device and radiological product issues each year.  Many of these documents include recommendations or requirements related to the collection of information.  For example, CDRH may request reports and recordkeeping from device manufacturers; these generally constitute collections of information.  CDRH must ensure that its documents that include any information collection comply with the PRA.  

Complying with the PRA involves identifying and analyzing the extent of information collected in the document; researching whether existing paperwork approval covers the information collection; drafting/editing documents necessary to comply with the PRA which includes Federal Register notices and supporting documents submitted to OMB; determining whether emergency clearance for information collection is necessary and undertaking any steps necessary to obtain that emergency clearance from OMB; discussing and responding to questions from OMB and the public; and updating existing approvals to ensure they do not expire. 
 
To meet the demand for expert knowledge of the Paper Reduction Act the Agency relies on knowledgeable staff.  The Office and Staffs in-house resources, though proficient, are often exceeded by the demand for this kind of expertise. The approval of this contract will greatly enhance the ability to address and respond to the often complex issues that arise with these compliance requirements; as establishing a professional services contract is a cost effective method, designed to allow us to provide the required expertise of an individual with the needed knowledge and skills. 

Scope of Work

A) Objective: 

To analyze CDRH documents that might implicate the PRA and determine whether any approval under the PRA is necessary.  In addition, if approval is necessary, the objective is to ensure that CDRH obtains that approval in a timely way by developing the necessary documents and working with the appropriate parties within CDRH, FDA, and OMB to obtain approval for the information collection.  

B) Scope of Work: 

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the consultant shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work described below: 
 
The consultant will work with CDRH in identifying documents that involve information collection.   
	
The consultant will analyze documents to determine what information is necessary to comply with PRA, including documents necessary to obtain new approvals and documents necessary to update existing approvals.   
	
The consultant may assist CDRH in developing training materials related to the PRA for CDRH staff.

The consultant will provide expertise to CDRH staff on the application of various statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders, on regulatory issues concerning medical devices and radiological health within the Paperwork Reduction Act, as well as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Administrative Procedures Act as needed. 
	
The consultant will also provide assistance on other projects, such as drafting standard operating procedures for the CDRH Regulations Staff which includes identifying issues that need to be resolved before the process can proceed and who the decision making authority should be on those issues, as directed by the CDRH Center and/or Office Directors. 

Tasks:

The contractor shall attend all meetings (in person or by phone) as requested by the liaison, Director of Regulations Staff or CDRH Deputy Director.  The contractor may assist CDRH in the development of a PRA training and other PRA training materials. The contractor shall assist with the development of Regulations Staff standard operating procedures. The contractor shall provide additional counsel or services related to PRA as directed by the liaison, Regulations Staff Director or CDRH Deputy Director. The contractor will be required to commit to scheduled and ad hoc telephone interaction with Regulations and/or Senior Office Staff.  The contractor will participate telephonically at meetings, and conferences as necessary, as a representative of FDA. 

Deliverables:

The contractor shall: 

1) Analyze documents identified as 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, as assigned, to determine if they implicate the PRA, and develop the documents required under the PRA (or requested by OMB) necessary to obtain approval.  Initial comments are due within 2 weeks of assignment, final comment within 1 week of receiving comments and concurrence from the Regulations Staff Director.  Deadlines for preparation of approval documents, where determined necessary, will be determined as assignments are made and based on the individual complexity and implications identified.  

2) Assist in development of training materials related to PRA.   Initial comments are due within 2 weeks of assignment, final comment within 1 week of receiving comments and concurrence from the Regulations Staff Director.  Deadlines for preparation of training documents will be determined as assignments are made.

3) Assist in development of Standard Operating Procedures related to PRA.   Initial comments are due within 2 weeks of assignment, final comment within 1 week of receiving comments and concurrence from the Regulations Staff Director.  Deadlines for preparation of procedures will be determined as assignments are made.  

4) Will provide counsel and services related to PRA as directed by the liaison, Regulations Staff Director or CDRH Deputy Director.

Level of Effort

It is estimated that a Senior Policy Analyst/Reviewer will be required on an average of 15 to 25 hours per week.  The number of actual hours expended each week will be determined by project need.  There could be periods of lesser or greater demand.

The Government anticipates that a Senior Policy Analyst/Reviewer is equivalent to a federal employee grade GS-15 with an hourly pay rate ranging from $57.90 to $73.41 per hour.  This is provided for information only, should not be considered restrictive, and is not a wage determination.

Payment Schedule:     Offers should include a breakout of the total number of hours proposed and the applicable hourly rate.  Payment will be made in monthly installments based on level of effort (hours worked).

Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be for one (1) year.  The anticipated period of performance is from March 1, 2009 through February 28, 2010.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.
Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>{This modification changes the type of agreement anticipated from an indefinite delivery requirements contract to a blanket purchase agreement.]

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Livestock & Seed Program (L&S), Seed and Regulatory Testing Branch (SRTB) in Gastonia, NC, intends to issue a sole source blanket purchase agreement with Anchor Paper Company located in St. Paul, MN for Anchor brand germination paper under the authority of FAR 6.302-2 and 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).  

Seed testing is performed to meet the requirements of the Federal Seed Act ( 7CFR Part  201) and in support of the voluntary seed testing and certification program (7CFR Part 75). This testing is conducted using Anchor brand germination paper as stated in the SRTB laboratory protocols in accordance with internal quality control standards as well as the international standards required for seed testing.  Anchor brand germination paper is the only product that will meet needs of the SRTB for the following reasons: a) Anchor Paper Company developed germination paper and holds the patent to their germination paper, b) Anchor brand germination paper meets both the internal and international quality requirements to support the enforcement of the Federal Seed Act requirements and the testing requirements to verify seed labeling claims and in support of the voluntary seed testing and certification program, and c) no other germination paper has been found to meet the requirements of the SRTB seed testing program.  

The agreement will be a blanket purchase agreement with an estimated value of $6,000 per year.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  Any questions or inquiries must be mailed, e-mailed, or faxed to the attention of the point of contact listed in this notice.  No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Grouse Survey:

The contractor will conduct lek surveys in the contract area in spring 2009.  The contract area is defined as that portion of the Little Missouri National Grassland that is in western Slope County, North Dakota.  

Lek surveys will entail finding new leks as well as determining whether or not previously located leks are still active.  A final report will be written as requested in Report Requirements.  Work is to begin by March 15, 2009 and finish by August 31, 2009. 

There are approximately 90,000 acres of National Grasslands in the contract area.

CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS:
B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in zoology, biology, or related field experience. 
One or more field seasons of experience in grouse surveying.
One or more field seasons experience as principle investigator on a grouse survey project. 

This surveys purpose is to locate and map most or all of the occupied sharp-tailed leks in the study area.  The Forest Service recognizes that locating every single lek might require intensive field work.  It is more important that the entire study area be covered rather than every lek be located.   Although the number of birds at each lek is of interest, it is the lek location that is of primary importance.  Therefore, this survey should be considered extensive, rather than intensive, in nature.   The data collected will be used by the USDA Forest Service for future management and planning decisions

A complete Solicitation Package will be uploaded into FedBizOpps by close of business February 10, 2009.  Final bids will be due March 2, 2009.

********************************************************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and four one-year option years.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the option years to extend the contract term.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $50,000,000.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $25,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $25,000 and $500,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is June 2009.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for the design of medical and/or dental facilities in tropical environments, similar to Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for the design of medical and/or dental facilities in tropical environments, similar to Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-E's quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this Contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor; and (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  For selection criteria (1) and (2), firms and staff with only medical or only dental facility design professional qualifications or specialized recent experience/technical competence will be less favorably considered than firms and staff with both medical and dental facility design qualifications and experience/technical competence.  In addition, the following medical and dental facility projects will be more favorably considered: DoD medical and dental facilities designed in accordance with Medical Military Facilities design criteria, and medical and dental facilities designed for tropical areas similar to Hawaii and Guam.  For selection criterion (3), the Government will also evaluate each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection  outcome.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project.  The Government will also evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 5 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB, VOSB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 09 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 77.51% to SB, 16.18% to SDB, 14.53% to  WOSB, 1.42% to HUBZone SB and 0.14 % to SDVOSB.  If the offeror is unable to meet the minimum targets, an explanation should be provided, stating what actions were taken to satisfy the minimum target and how such actions failed to meet the objective.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract or meet the NAVFAC small business subcontracting goals, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as a HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  For Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Certifications, effective October 1, 2008, the offeror may accept a self-certification from its SDB subcontractors as defined in 13 CFR 124.1002.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract, refer to FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008).  Failure to register in the DOD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the DOD CCR Website at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.  Refer to FAR 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (JAN 2006).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.  The submittal/delivery address is Commander, Code NAVFAC PAC ACQ13 (A-E Solicitation No. N62742-09-R-0004), Attn:  Mailroom (MS2), NAVFAC PACIFIC, 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860-3134.  This address is for all deliveries, including US Mail, courier service and/or personal delivery services; no other address is acceptable.  The delivery address is inside a military installation, therefore, strict securities measures are in force; anticipate delays.  Interested firms must allow sufficient time for receipt of submission.  Consultants to the prime A-E firm are required to submit only Part II of the SF 330.  This solicitation requires all interested firms to have an email address.  Notifications will be via email, therefore, email address must be shown on the SF 330, Part 1, Section B8.

<DESC>** This synopsis was last updated on Monday, February 9, 2009.  Updates are listed at the end of this Description. **

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a competitive IDIQ contract for technical expertise support services in the following three program areas:

Program Area 1: Creating and Disseminating Integrity Management Knowledge
The Contractor must provide necessary technical, management, and administrative services to support PHMSA in generating and promoting knowledge to IM decision makers.  This initiative is intended to increase PHMSAs and pipeline stakeholders awareness of new technology, effectiveness of consensus standards incorporated into Parts 192-195 of PHMSAs regulatory program, and to organize and conduct selected PHMSA public events and growing need in assessing quality from multiple program outputs.

Program Area 2: Cross Border and International issues and Frontier Region Assessments
PHMSAs cross border coordination is growing through a recent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Arrangement with the Canadian National Energy Board. Understanding and quantifying differences between North American pipeline operations is important before an implementation strategy for harmonizing IM inspections and audits and consistent application of consensus standards is created.  Challenges also exist in frontier regions (i.e., Arctic) where identification and quantification of information to PHMSA decision makers is greatly desired. 

Program Area 3: Technical Support during Pipeline Emergencies
Major pipeline failures and natural disasters can occur.  Immediately after these events, PHMSA emphasizes significant attention to technical and regulatory detail so appropriate corrective action orders are generated rapidly.  In some cases, on-site collection of technical and photo details is required so mission critical actions are not delayed.

This is a competitive small business set-aside under the NAICS Code 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.  The period of performance will be for one base year with four possible option years.
  
** UPDATED AS OF FRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 2009 **
(1) Total estimated value of the requirement is $2.4 million (over a possible five-year period of performance).  
(2) Estimated issue date of the solicitation package will be on or around January 23, 2009, with an estimated closing response date on or around February 25, 2009.

Edits include:
-- Changed title of Program Area 1.
-- Removed reference to contract award date. 

** UPDATED AS OF MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2009 **
(1) The solicitation package was uploaded on Monday, February 9, 2009.  Please download and review the solicitation package for all pertinent details related to this procurement, including closing response due date and time.  
(2) Offerors are responsible for downloading all issued amendments, if any.
(3) No additional updates will be made to this synopsis, except for updating the Response Date, if necessary.

<DESC><p>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Administrative Facilities Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV ). Small Business Set-Aside<br /><br />The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David L. Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail to David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<br /><br />FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative. The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities. The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WIT) barracks and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK &amp; TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK: <br /><br />Administrative Facilities - The scope consists of but is not limited to the following administrative facilities as separate or combined tasks:<br /><br />The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities. The BN HQ is where visitors can be received and entry into the complex controlled and has a clear and convenient pedestrian access to the Barracks/Company Operations Facility (BCOFs) and Dining Facility (DFAC). BN HQ facilities shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for Buildings and Facilities. BN HQs will have private offices. The BN HQ facility will provide a staff duty station at the building entrance/reception area. Every HQ BN will provide a Secure Communications Room with a Secret Internet Protocol Router network (SIPRNET) connectivity in accordance with latest criteria.<br /><br />The administrative building function is to provide soldier mission direction and operational needs requirements. This facility will operate in a similar manner as the Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building.<br /><br />The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments. Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries. Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility. <br /><br />It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<br /><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This solicitation will be evaluated under a Single Phase Design Build Process. Interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) will submit certain specified performance capability information, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability information in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation. <br /><br />Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the proposals, in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror(s), whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering past performance, technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost. To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee. <br /><br />The following technical evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation: Volume 1 Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach; Volume II - Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements. Volume III - Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns. All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Solicitation W9126G-09-R-0012 is estimated to issue on or about 30 Jan 2009. Phase 1 proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 9 Mar 2009. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million. <br /><br />The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation. In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude. The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition. Each contract will remain active: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government. It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation. Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type. Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior. The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination. <br /><br />The total estimated contract capacity is $100,000,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. The minimum task order limitation is $10,000. The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $6,000,000. The maximum combination of orders is $12,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price. <br /><br />The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for Small Businesses. Plans and specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy. For security reasons, all technical and engineering data related to this solicitation will be distributed using the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) system.

Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.) Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 32% to small business concerns; 18% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 5.8% to women-owned small business concerns; 10% for HUBZONE concerns; 3% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and 13.0% to HBCU/MI. The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,500,000. Responses to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged.

Visitors requiring access must present a drivers license, current passport, or similar positive identification. Facsimile copies are not acceptable. Security personnel are neither Government employees nor Government contractor employees. For purposes of determining whether an offer is late, delivery into the hands of security personnel will not constitute delivery to the Government. In order to ensure delivery to the Government, persons hand-delivering offers should call the contract specialist whose name appears in the procurement and ask the specialist to send someone to the security desk to take possession of the offer. This is not a request for proposal. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.

<DESC>Amended Notice for Performance Period (Construction Duration):<BR><BR>The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990.  An Invitation For Bids (IFB) will be issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 14.2 and FAR Subpart 36.213-3.  The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000.00 to $100,000,000.00.  This announcement is UNRESTRICTED and open to all businesses regardless of size.  <BR><BR>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hurricane Protection Office has a firm fixed-price construction services requirement for the Rehabilitation of Hurricane Gustav and Ike Damage, Grand Isle and Vicinity, Jefferson, Parish, LA. . Award will be made to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the IFB, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the invitation.  <BR><BR>Project Information. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, vehicles, equipment, tools, insurance, supervision, and transportation, and incidental services to perform the rehabilitation repairs at Grand Isle. The majority of the dune at Grand Isle is to be reconstructed with a geotextile tube core and sand cap.  The geotextile tube core will be 30,100 feet or about 5.7 miles long (see attached drawings).  The tubes will be filled with material from excavation of the existing dune with limited fine content. The Corps has installed ~7620 ft of geotextile wrapped clay to an elevation near 9 ft NAVD88.  The geotextile tube will overlap the ends of this clay structure on the gulf side by approximately 50 ft.  The tubes are to be coated on the top 50% of its surface area with a synthetic polyurea spray-on coating applied at the factory for UV resistance as well as abrasion resistance.  Twenty locations have been designated for pedestrian crossings along with six emergency vehicle access locations.  The pedestrian crossings will be constructed similar to highway on-ramps that run up the side of the dune slope, over the top of the dune, and then back down the opposite side.  The tubes and existing clay structure will be capped with sand and parts of the beach will be nourished.  This material will come from the designated offshore site.  The type of dredge is restricted to any dredge method other than a hopper dredge.    The total volume of material to be dredged is approximately 1 Million cubic yards (CY) of sandy material. Geo textile tubes and anchor tubes will be filled with a slurry. Typical earthwork construction equipment will be used for establishing the required sand cover depth (minimum of 3 ft) and width (approx. 80 ft) over the geotextile tube dune core. The beach sand will be spread out in the same manner. The contractor will use a dredge pipeline to transfer material to the beach. . The wearing surface of the pedestrian crossings will be a roll-out mat system.  The emergency vehicle crossings will be constructed of Articulated Concrete Block (ACB) mats. Sand Fencing will be constructed along the dune.  .All dune construction will be planted.  <BR><BR>Construction completion is 170 days after notice to proceed.  First order of work is excavating the existing dune and installing the geotextile tube core. The time stated for completion of all work does not include demobilization, final cleanup of the work area, or dune planting.  Dune planting may commence February 1st of 2010 and must be complete 60 days after February 1st.to take advantage of proper growing season.  <BR><BR>IFB is anticipated to be issued on or about February 23, 2009.  The closing date and time for submission of bids will be contained in the subsequent IFB solicitation package.  Bid Opening Date will also be provided in solicitation.  The solicitation documents for this procurement will be posted via Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) to the following website: www.fedbizopps.gov in Portable Document Format (*.pdf).

Description
The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as Challenge Proposals proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that challenge an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equipment, combined equipment, longer missions, better batteries). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level); surveillance, tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training). 4.) Other proposals that support our national strategy.  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under Reference Materials on the website. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and all required Federal Acquisiton Regulation (FAR) criteria for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2010 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2009. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil. Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 1500 hours EST, 27 February 2009. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.
