Volume III, the PDS, consists only of the PDS item with no supporting requirement.<br><br><br>Question: In order to determine a price we need to view patterns and a spec description. We also need to know exactly what fabric is needed and the preferred source of that fabric.<br><br>Answer: This requirement is for a commercial Army Combat Pant that meets the required salient characteristics of the request for proposals. There is no pattern or spec description, other than the salient characteristics.<br><br><br>Question: We would like to know what the Army paid per unit last time these items were purchased?<br><br>Answer: There is no pricing history as this is the first time this item is being procured. <br><br><br>Question: Has the Army selected a fabric for these? We manufacture so we usually sew what we are told to sew and we are told what fabric you want and we get a pattern so we can cost? How would a manufacturer know how many yards to use in putting a proposal together?

We are looking for Contractors to propose a developed item that meets the salient characteristics that are listed in the FBO posting.<br><br><br>Question:  I would like to see if I can respectfully ask for an extension so we may submit a finished product with the new FR material? If not, can we submit the finished pant without our FR fabric in order to show form and function? We would later submit the finished product with the new FR fabric. We can submit a fabric spec sheet to supplement non-FR sample.<br><br>Answer: The Government cannot provide an extension at this time. All proposals must be complete to be considered, including a finished PDS that is representative of the commercial item being proposed to meet the salient characteristics. <br><br><br>Question: Do we have to include a past performance section? If so, in what volume should we include it?<br><br>Answer: A Past Performance proposal is not required for this request for proposals. <br><br><br>Question: Can we use a font size similar or equivalent to Times New Roman 12?<br><br>Answer: No. Proposals shall be in Times New Roman size 12. <br><br><br>Question: Can the test data and COC letters be on an appendix?<br><br>Answer: No.<br><br><br>Question: Is the 15 pages limit for the technical proposal single page or double page?<br><br>Answer:  Single page. <br><br><br>Question: We would normally provide all the CoCs, Berry Compliance letters, and Letters of Commitment for the materials and components in the proposal for the PDM. Can these be provided in Vol 3?<br><br>Answer: No.<br><br><br>Question: Is there a page limitation for Vol 3, the section for the PDM?<br><br>Answer: There is no written proposal component of Vol 3, only the PDS garment.<br><br><br>Question: We respectfully request the lead time for the first delivery to be in 150 days in lieu of 90 days.<br><br>Answer: The Government cannot extend the delivery schedule due to schedule requirements, etc.<br><br><br>Question:  We understand that we only need to provide one Technical proposal for each Volume (1 thru 4), no additional copies, correct?<br><br>Answer: Contractor proposal submissions shall be submitted in Contractor's format in Adobe PDF with two CDs for each Volume consisting of the information required in the request for proposals.

<DESC>Infomation on the asbestos: One sample of chinking was collected and analyzed. It contained 5% asbestos. The reason only on sample was collected was because not much of the chinking was easily removed. We do not want the chinking to be intentionally removed. However, should it come off, the contractor knows that it contains asbestos and needs to be handled properly.
<p>For the specifications of preparing the logs follow specification section 02905 Part 3. Except disregard reference to treating inside spaces that specifications has been removed.</p>
<p>All other specifications ands requirements will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>We need reagents and supplies to support running a Genome Sequencer FLX system housed at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center. The Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (GS FLX) is a DNA sequencer designed and built by 454 Life Sciences and distributed by Roche Applied Science. The technology for this system is based on enrichment of fragmented DNA followed by clonal amplification and pyrosequencing. The sequencer can generate up to 500 million bases per 7.5 hour run, achieve reads averaging 350 to 450 bases, attain over 1,000,000 reads per run, generate single-read accuracy that is greater than 99%, and achieve consensus accuracy greater than 99.99%. Reagents required to run this system include GS Titanium compatible library preparation kits for linker modified single stranded DNA, SV emulsion based PCR kits for titration of the library fragments for the sequencing reaction, LV emulsion based PCR kits for preparative reactions of bead-linked DNA fragments for sequencing, Titanium chemistry sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits which provide the surface for sequencing of the DNA fragments.<br />Roche is the sole supplier and distributor of the GS FLX instrument. The GS titanium library preparation reagents, emulsion based PCR kits, sequencing kits, and PicoTiter Plate Kits are only available through Roche. The GS FLX warranty is conditional that customers agree to use the instrument in strict accordance with Roche operating instructions, including Roche sole source specifications regarding reagent kits. The FLX sequencer makes use of very specialized reagents only available from Roche at the present time in a form suitable for use on the instrument.</p>
