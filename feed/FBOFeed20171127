<RESPDATE>102717
<CONTACT>Maureen Myrthel, Phone 5706159535, Email Maureen.Myrthel.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This is published as a brand name sole source announcement under the statutory authority at 10 USC 2304(c) (1), and regulatory authority at FAR 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, Application for Brand Name Description. The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Division E, Tobyhanna Branch, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), Tobyhanna, PA 18466 intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed priced contract for Brand Name only; EMCORE OPTIVA Fiber Optic equipment manufactured by EMCORE Corporation (EMCORE), 2015 Chestnut Street, Alhambra, CA 91803.<br />EMCORE is the sole designer and developer of the OPTIVA Fiber Optic equipment.
<p>The Brand Name EMCORE OPTIVA Fiber Optic equipment is required for use in the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) Prototype Integration Test &amp; Training (PITT) facility modification/upgrade project. The brand Name EMCOR OPTIVE fiber optic equipment is required to facilitate the proper integration with EMCORE OPTIVA fiber optic equipment already utilized in the field by Air Force Wideband Enterprise Terminals (AFWET) agency personnel. AFWET Fiber Optic equipment is located inside the Strategic Site's Electronic Enclosure Buildings (EEB). The required integration is in support of the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal Installations.</p>
<p>The EMCORE OPTIVA fiber optics equipment  under went approval and certification processes for use through Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), as well as Program Management  Wideband Enterprise SATCOM Systems (PMWESS), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) who must also approve the use of the fiber optic equipment. Based on the previous costs and time incurred to obtain the approvals and certification of the EMCORE OPTIVA fiber optic equipment, it is estimated that approval and certification of fiber optic equipment from any other manufacturer would cause an unacceptable delay of 6-8 months and cost the Government an amount exceeding the estimated cost of this acquisition.</p>
<p>It is critical that commonality of fiber optic equipment be maintained between TYAD PITT facility, TYAD designed Satellite Communications Terminals such as the AN/TSC-86F(V)2 and fiber optic equipment currently utilized by AFWET to ensure consistency and the ability to properly integrate communications equipment located in both the terminal and EEB.</p>
<p>TYAD Technical experts have determined if any equipment, other than EMCORE OPTIVA fiber optic equipment were to be utilized, integration with the Air Force Wideband Enterprise Terminal System (AFWET) fiber optic equipment would be costly and require a lengthy approval and certification process.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals for other than the Brand Name EMCORE OPTIVA Fiber Optic Equipment. Any responsible firms believing they can provide a product that is certified and approved for integration in the TYAD PITT facility, should within ten (10) days of this notice, contact in writing the Contract Specialist identified below, and submit a capability statement describing the product's capability to meet the Government's requirements, which will be reviewed for consideration. Used, refurbished, gray or aftermarket items will not be considered.</p>
<p>The following is the list of brand name EMCORE OPTIVA fiber optic equipment configurations and quantities required. Equipment shall be new. Used or refurbished equipment will not be considered. Delivery is required within 10 weeks from date of award.</p>
<p>3 each Ethernet Transceiver EMCORE part Number OTP-1ETR-A2/A2-LC</p>
<p>40 each Fiber Optic Receiver, EMCORE part Number OTS-1LR/S5-SA-IC</p>

<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is a joint, integrated DoD Combat Support Agency that enables the US Army, US Navy, and US Air Force medical services to provide a medically ready force and ready medical force to Combatant Commands in both peacetime and wartime. The DHA supports the delivery of integrated, affordable, and high quality health services to Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries and is responsible for driving greater integration of clinical and business processes across the MHS by:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Implementing shared services with common measurement of outcomes;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Enabling rapid adoption of proven practices, helping reduce unwanted variation, and improving the coordination of care across time and treatment venues;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Exercising management responsibility for joint shared services and the TRICARE Health Plan; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Acting as the market manager for the National Capital Region (NCR) enhanced Multi-Service Market, which includes Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH).<br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is contemplating a new indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) dental services contract with fixed unit prices for the TRICARE Dental Readiness and Wellness (TDRAW) procurement. DHA anticipates the TDRAW will consolidate the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP), the dental requirements of the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP), the dental requirements of the Reserve Health Readiness Program (RHRP) contracts with the Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP). DHA anticipates the TDRAW contract will provide worldwide dental coverage to Active Duty Service Members and their family members, members of the Selected Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve and their family members.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to provide potential offerors with the 2nd DRAFT TDRAW Request for Proposal (RFP). This Notice follows the previous DRAFT TDRAW RFP and two earlier Requests for Information (RFIs) postings (HT9402-DHA-RFI-1 and HT9402-DHA-TDRAW-RFI-2) and is part of ongoing market research. It is intended solely for information and planning purposes only and is NOT a solicitation. Offerors are invited to review the attached DRAFT solicitation documents and submit questions or comments about the 2nd DRAFT RFP (see "TDRAW 2nd Draft RFP Questions Template") via email to Ms. Margaret Zancanella, Contracting Officer, Margaret.a.zancanella.civ@mail.mil not later than 4:00 pm MT, December 15, 2017. Please include the following in the subject line: "TDRAW 2nd DRAFT HT9402-17-R-0001."</p>
<p>DHA is seeking industry feedback and recommendations on DHA's description of the TDRAW requirements and DHA's approach in the 2nd draft RFP sections attached to this draft solicitation. DHA will consider industry's comments to its approach for the TDRAW program to ensure the Government has realistic requirements and incorporates industry best practices, new technologies, innovative alternatives and potential capabilities as they relate to the TDRAW specifications and performance work statement.</p>
<p>DHA may also incorporate industry expertise, best practices and incentives to ensure the delivery of high quality dental support services to TRICARE beneficiaries within the statutory and regulatory limitations governing this entitlement program.</p>
<p>DHA requests that responders identify the specific solicitation document and cite specific paragraphs where appropriate, using the "TDRAW 2nd Draft RFP Questions" file included as an attachment to this DRAFT solicitation.</p>
<p>DHA is not issuing a solicitation at this time, and this Notice shall not be construed as DHA's commitment to issue a solicitation nor does it restrict DHA to a particular acquisition approach. Interested firms shall not send proposals in response to this Notice, nor shall they contact any other individuals about this Notice or the TDRAW requirement. Any information provided to DHA is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation, and is clearly provided at no cost to the Government.</p>
<p>If DHA issues a solicitation, DHA will conduct any source selection in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15, as supplemented, at Contracting Office-Aurora (CO-A), in Aurora, Colorado. DHA estimates it may issue a formal solicitation&nbsp;in early 2018 on the Federal Business Opportunities (fbo.gov) website.</p>
<p>Any future information on this acquisition will be posted on www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the prospective offeror to review this site regularly for updates and/or changes.</p>

This is a pre-solicitation public announcement a solicitation for proposals will follow this with due dates for proposals.  
Background:  Runway Status Lights System Description
Concept of Operations:  Runway Status Lights is an essential FAA system which uses Airport Surface Surveillance data to determine vehicle and aircraft locations. Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.
System:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.

The current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and
35.106.	A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.

Abstracts may be submitted at any time prior to the response date.

FAR Part 35 restricts the use of Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advance technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.

This announcement seeks out to improve the overall integrity of the Department of the Navyâ€™s fuel tanks, reduce maintenance and all associated costs, and decreases the out of service periods for the Department of the Navyâ€™s fuel infrastructure.
 This effort will design and develop a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can provide both inspection and cleaning capabilities for a wide-range of fuel based storage tanks. The capability to provide intrinsically safe, real-time remote monitoring would significantly reduce labor and out-of-service costs and vulnerability, and increase available bulk fuel storage capacity. In pursuit of these goals, the Department of the Navy seeks innovations with potential for use at multiple locations that improve tank in sections, as described in the topic below.

The integrity of the Navyâ€™s fuel storage infrastructure is of paramount importance to ensure mission readiness and avoid environmental consequences.
  Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) costs are heavy. The Navy currently possesses a wide-range of small fuel based storage tanks, 101 of which are identified as Steel Tank Institute (STI) fabricated tanks subject to the API internal/out-of-service inspection cycle.  There are many costs and risks associated with taking a tank out of service for inspection, including fuel removal and storage, manual cleaning, and downtime.  The hazards associated with the cleaning, entry, inspection, testing, maintenance or other aspects are significant. Safety considerations and controls have to be established prior to undertaking these activities associated with tanks.  Due to the complexities of construction contracting, the contracting effort for an internal Clean  and  Inspect (CI) project starts at least a year in advance.
 When ready, fuel is transferred from one tank to another for storage. The tank is then opened and ventilated until such time that it is safe for the entry of a cleaning team.  Out of service time can have a significant effect on mission readiness and strategic application due to the negative effect on petroleum reserves and availability.  An average CI project renders a tank out of service for two years. These costs and risks can be significantly mitigated by using and developing robotic inspection technologies to automate the process and deliver real time data on tank condition without taking a tank out of service.  DoD financial imperatives dictate identifying and employing as many efficiencies as possible.

The technologies or methodology shall address the following topic area.

NEED TOPIC NO 1: STI Internal Inspections (WET-SIDE)

RDTE of technologies to design and produce a small ROV that would be used to inspect and clean the inside of small fuel storage tanks (i.e.
 STI tanks).  Examples of ROV capabilities could include:

ABSTRACT SUBMITTALS TO THIS BAA CAN BE MADE USING THE ABSTRACT FORM.
 Submissions should be made via the NAVFAC EXWC BAA e-mail: maria.z.smith@navy.mil.

Submission process: This announcement is for abstracts/white papers only. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to the topic area. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on the stated criteria. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications.

The abstracts will be evaluated by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement.
 When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal.  Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission.

Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR part 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years. The government may choose to fund a base period with options.

The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA, of approximately equal weight.

1).
 TECHNICAL APPROACH: Describe the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, in terms of Naval relevance. All proposals must demonstrate an approach that will achieve a DOD technology readiness level (TRL) of 6/7 as the end state, and successfully manage risk while achieving technological advance. Provide an explicit, detailed description of the approach.  If options are required describe appropriate research activities and milestones for subsequent options. The abstract should indicate what tasks are planned, how and where the work will be conducted, a schedule of major events, and the final product(s) to be delivered.
Offerorâ€™s effort should demonstrate the approach to prove the technical feasibility of the concept, including the risk reduction strategies.
  The planned methods to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail.  This section should be a substantial portion of the abstract.

2). PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORâ€™S and KEY MEMBERâ€™S RELATED EXPERIENCE: The
qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract.

3). SAFETY:  NAVFAC requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important part of NAVFAC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale.

4). PAST PERFORMANCE:  The offerors corporate capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the offerors proposed objectives.
  Experience will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence.

5). COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. Describe here a high level estimate of the cost/price, relative to the proposed technical approach. If work in the technical approach is presented in tasks/milestones/technical phases, cost estimates for each are desired.  This can be a single dollar figure for each task/phase at the abstract phase.  At a minimum the offeror shall provide a high level estimated cost, and the narrative basis for this estimate.

6). NAVY BENEFIT AND IMPACT: Expected benefits in terms of reduced total facility ownership cost, projections of the number of Navy sites or facilities where the proposed technology could be deployed, and life cycle cost advantages over current approaches used by Naval facilities.

CRITICAL NOTE: An Offeror is required to be registered with the system for award management (SAM) before any contract award can be made.
 Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov.

This is being sole sourced because This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement N00383-14-G-005D with Raytheon Company, McKinney, TX (Cage Code 96214). This synopsis serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by NAVSUP WSS in the time period from December 1, 2017 to November 30, 2018 against the subject BOA.

Individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under the Navy Weapon System covered by this BOA. A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact. 

Pursuant to this synopsis, orders issued against the subject BOA will be issued in accordance with 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award as the items are flight critical and/or the available technical data has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production/repair of the same or similar item.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Received offers that failed to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under any order issued against the subject BOA. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on the Fleet support needs.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">SUBJECT: Request for Information - Snap on Tools</span></p>
<p>1. This will be an official Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR Part 52.215-3. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated will be solely at the interested party's expense. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities (FedbizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2. The 7th Contracting Squadron (7 CONS) intends to procure snap on tools to meet the specifications provided in the exceel spreadsheet attached to this fbo post. These tools must also include a lifetime warranty, along with on base pick up and replacement. For example, on a bi-weekly basis a representative stops by to pick up and drop off tools. The customer already possesses the foam inserts and boxes, so the tools must meet the exact requirements to fit in the pre-made inserts. The NAICS Code for this requirement is, 332216 - Saw Blade and Handtool Manufacturing. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB).</p>
<p>3. The aforementioned information along with interest and capability statements are requested to be provided no later than 01 December 2017. Please answer all of the questions in as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>4. The requests for information are as follows:</p>
<p>a. What would be the cost for the amount of tools following the exact specifications provided?</p>
<p>b. What companies can provide and delivery the above mentioned tools?</p>
<p>c. Will these items come with a lifetime warranty, as requested, and on base pick up and delivery of tools?</p>
<p>5. The information that is received from this RFI will be used to make the best decision on how to proceed with this acquisition. All information will be kept within the 7th Contracting Squadron, and will not be shared with any other potential offerors. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact A1C Lydia Simpkins at lydia.simpkins@us.af.mil (Phone: 325-696-3605) or Lt Teresa Elsbree at teresa.elsbree.2@us.af.mil (Phone: 325-696-3551)</p>

<DESC><strong>Duke Family of Systems Production and Sustainment</strong><br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: Army Contracting Command<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />This Sources Sought is not a request for competitive proposals and no formal solicitation package is available. Solicitation Number W56KGY17RF079 has been assigned to this Market Research for reference purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement.
<p>Interested parties may identify their capability to meet all or portions of the requirements by submitting: a white paper, technical data, qualification and certification test data, logistics documentation and past performance data. This data must be provided to this office not later than 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 20 April 2017. Only responses received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Full Description of the requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Product Director Electronic Attack (PD EA) are conducting market research. The purpose of this market survey is to identify parties qualified and interested in becoming the prime contractor for this effort.</p>
<p>PD EA anticipates a requirement for production and sustainment, hardware and services, of the following Duke systems and their assorted variants: Duke V4 AN/VLQ-12(V)4 RT-2040, Duke V5 (AN/VLQ-12 (V)5) RT-2040/RT-1950, Duke V5 Saber Fury variant (to include the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Mobile Integrated Capability (CMIC) Electronic Warfare (EW) vehicle, Sabre Fury on tactical vehicles, and EW Tactical Vehicle (EWTV) variations), and Ground Auto Targeting Observation Reactive (GATOR) Jammer V3 (AN/FLQ-15(V)3). The Sabre Fury, Duke V4, and Duke V5 are programmable software defined ground EW systems that will provide sensing and electronic negation of systems of interest. The GATOR V3 system is a fixed site that provides EW capabilities in a trailer mounted configuration. The Duke FoS provides Offensive and Defensive Electronic Attack, as well as, EW support to protect vehicles, convoys, and fixed sites from EW threats. These systems will operate both individually and in networked, mixed fleet configurations for a variety of ground EW missions to include counter-command and control (C2) operations against near-peer systems.</p>
<p>Efforts under this requirement will support the above systems and any future variants and ancillaries and include: Hardware; Product Support Management; Procurement; System Repair; Engineering and Software Support; Maintenance Planning and Management; Materiel Maintenance; Logistics; Field Service Support; Supply Support; Repair Parts ; Support Equipment Procurement; Technical Data, Training and Training Support; Platform Integration, and Depot Facilitation if required. The Government will define specific requirements in individual Task Orders (TOs) for services or Delivery Orders (DOs) for materials.</p>
<p>The Government envisions a hybrid IDIQ five-year contract, with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and Cost Reimbursement (CR) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Task Orders or Delivery Orders issued under this IDIQ contract will specifically identify contract CLIN type by task. The Government shall utilize FFP CLINs to purchase materials (e.g., spare parts, etc.) and FFP on select well defined/limited scope service tasks. The Government will utilize Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs to purchase Services and CR CLINs for travel, and other direct costs (ODCs) in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.302, "Cost Contract". <br />The Sabre Fury System: The Sabre Fury mounted system is based off the Counter Radio-Controlled EW (CREW) AN/VLQ-12(V)4/(V)5 Countermeasures System, referred to as the "Duke V4/V5 (DV4/V5)." As a result of emerging needs, the U.S. Army is seeking to adapt the Duke V4/V5 system hardware and software to provide increased capabilities in the areas of EW, to include signal detection, status and event reporting, and electronic response. The Sabre Fury consists of the receivers, transmitters, antennas, remote control unit, direction-finding (DF) sensors, and cabling. <br />The Sabre Fury system differs in mission employment from the CREW Duke system in that the primary objective is to detect signals of interest and report them to a user. Additionally, by leveraging the transmission capabilities of the Duke V4/V5 hardware, the Sabre Fury possesses the capacity to perform EW missions at a user's request. While the existing Duke V4/V5 inherently supports some aspects of this mission, several modifications and developments are required to bring this capability to bear as part of an integrated EW networked system. Examples of these include changes to the system's configuration, integration with a DF sensor, and development of the mechanisms to provide user monitoring and management of the Sabre Fury from a U.S. Army external tactical EW system.</p>
<p>The Stryker-based CMIC EW vehicle focuses on the C-UAS mission through the use of firmware, software and loadsets specifically designed to optimize performance against emerging threats. CMIC is also enabled to conduct operations against other emerging tactical threats. The system includes v5 electronics tactical antennas, omni-directional antennas, and the SRC Directional Finding (DF) subsystem all under the control of the MAFIA C2 software for autonomous or man-in-the-loop operation. The CMIC Sabre Fury is readily reprogrammed and optimized for ground EW missions.</p>
<p>The Sabre Fury system will also be installed in tactical vehicles to provide distributed, networked EW operations. Sabre Fury EW systems may be installed on any tactical platform by leveraging the CREW Duke A-kit with minor modifications. Remote networked operation can be accomplished with an existing EW Command and Control system and Planning Suites networked via standard tactical radio.</p>
<p>The EWTV variant is a Sabre Fury-based EW system hosted on a MaxxPro Dash MRAP and is based on the fixed-site GATOR's server-based architecture. It can be operated as a mobile EW command and control node for the networked EW assets. In addition to the standard Sabre Fury ES and EA functions, the EWTV will also be capable of executing the specialized GATOR missions. <br /><br />GATOR V3: The GATOR V3 system is a fixed site, trailer mounted jamming capability. It provides easy set-up/tear-down in approximately 3 hours with 3 people; only one individual requires training to operate. It is a self-contained, turn-key system that is equipped with its own power, shelter, and self-erecting tower on-board. Intuitive design provides pertinent information to the user on one screen while map overlays provide useful common operational picture. The GATOR V3 system architecture design supports networking; enabling the user to update the server, software defined radio, firmware, maps, shape files, and graphical user interface. Finally the GATOR V3 provides active monitoring capabilities through Electromagnetic Energy sensing, real-time indications and warnings capability, Battle Damage Assessment and Measure of Effectiveness/Measure of Performance validation.</p>
<p>Limitations: The Government does not own complete detailed design/fabrication documentation, software source code, or the technical data package for the Duke FoS listed above to provide to a third party. Technical data is the property of the original equipment manufacturer, SRC Inc., North Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p>Major Milestones: Anticipated RFP Release Date: 4QFY17</p>
<p>The security requirements for this effort will be as follows: Facility Clearance required shall be TOP SECRET SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS/SCI) with TS/SCI safeguarding capability.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no formal solicitation package is available. Solicitation Number W56KGY17RF079 has been assigned to this market survey for reference purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Interested parties may identify their capability to meet all or portions of the requirements by submitting an unclassified white paper, technical data and past performance data. Respondents must also address the following items:<br />1. Company Name, Contact Name, Position, Telephone, Email, and Company URL.<br />2. Corporate capability to include available facilities to execute sustainment requirements, Facility Clearance and safeguarding levels, Cage code, and DUNs number.</p>
<p>White paper and additional data must be provided to this office no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 20 April 2017. Only responses received by this date will be considered. Respondents must identify, in writing, their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting one (1) electronic copy via email to Ms. Adrianne L. Paolercio (Adrianne.L.Paolercio.civ@mail.mil) and Mr. Ricardo Riviera (Ricardo.A.Rivera50.civ@mail.mil).</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking contractors capable of providing spectrometer(s) for High-Resolution X-Ray Emission Spectrometry and X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure.
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP/RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. The information contained in this notice is a DRAFT only and, as such, is subject to change prior to issuance of a solicitation. No solicitation is available at this time. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive or non-competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small business sources are identified during this market research stage, this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUB Zone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees. <br /><br />Interested business organizations that believe they may be capable of meeting NIST's requirements detailed below should respond to this notice with a narrative demonstrating their ability to meet NIST's requirements. Contractors may provide supplemental information at their discretion. Responses should be submitted to Grace.Parker@nist.gov no later than 10:00 AM Eastern Time on 12/18/2017.<br /><br />DRAFT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p><br />A.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The NIST Chemical Sciences Division develops test methods and reference materials in support of the U.S. Measurement System.  The Division is responsible for establishing traceability of measured values to the International System of Units in the area of chemical metrology.  The Division requires capabilities for high-resolution X-ray emission and fluorescence spectrometry and for X-ray absorption fine structure measurement in a normal laboratory setting in Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>X-ray emission Spectrometry (XES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) are tools for determination of the oxidation states of elements in materials and for determination of the atomic bonding spatial arrangements in materials.  The Division intends to use these capabilities to study chemical processes and to characterize reference materials for chemical properties.  One example application is the determination of the amount of hexavalent chromium atoms in polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  This information is required to demonstrate regulatory compliance of products made with PVC.  Numerous additional applications are planned.</p>
<p>Establishment of these X-ray spectrometric capabilities in laboratories in Gaithersburg will facilitate experimental design and preparation for conducting more powerful experiments at synchrotron facilities maintained and used by NIST.  The synergy between lab-based and synchrotron-based measurement capabilities will enable more efficient use of the synchrotron facilities, including travel resources, and will enable NIST Gaithersburg scientists to design and conduct measurements for process monitoring and control.</p>
<p>B.	OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The NIST Chemical Sciences Division requires one or more spectrometers for high-resolution X ray emission spectrometry (XES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrometry.  The spectrometers shall be laboratory-based design(s), as exemplified by the designs of Seidler, et al. (1).  The system(s) shall be composed of a spectrometer, sample positioning equipment, computer for control and data acquisition, water chiller (depending on the X-ray source design), and other ancillary equipment and accessories.  The system(s) shall perform unattended, automated, X-ray measurements with high resolution, sensitivity, and precision, and accuracy of energy calibration.  The system(s) shall be capable of high-resolution measurements of X ray fluorescence and absorption spectra across the X-ray energy range of 2 keV to 13 keV, using spherically bent crystals and high-sensitivity X-ray detector(s) in a wavelength dispersive design.  An energy dispersive design providing the required performance would also be of interest.  The required X-ray energy resolution is of the order of 1 eV to 3 eV, depending on the line or absorption edge being measured.  The spectrometers shall be configurable for both fluorescence mode and transmission mode measurements.  The computer(s) used to control measurements shall be capable of running state-of-the-art software for evaluation of the measured data, as exemplified by the Athena software (2).</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Medical Equipment Repair Parts (multiple award BPA)
<p>This is a request for information for market survey to be used for preliminary planning purposes and to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses under the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code 339112 for the proposed acquisition. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and no contract will be awarded from this request for information. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this request for information or any follow up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USMRAA) on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Activity (USAMMA) has reoccurring requirements for medical equipment repair parts. Medical equipment used by deployed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan is returned to one of four facilities for repair, refurbishment or replacement when the repair exceeds a deployed unit's maintenance capability. These four CONUS facilities locations include (Tobyhanna, PA; Tracy, CA; Hill AFB, UT; and Sierra, CA).However, the Government may add additional receiving points to include OCONUS locations. In order to meet this requirement, the Government intends to award multiple BPAs, for a five (5) year ordering period, to furnish medical equipment repair parts if and when ordered by the contracting officer or a designated ordering officer.</p>
<p>Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts. The Government will analyze all responses and determine the acquisition strategy for this requirement. The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: With very few exceptions, medical equipment repair parts are available only from the manufacturer of the equipment or from a firm that has been licensed by the manufacturer to produce authorized parts. Army Regulation (AR) 40-61, Medical Logistics Policies, prohibits modifications or alterations of Army medical equipment without the manufacturer's consent. Therefore brand name only parts are needed so as not to negate the manufacturer's product liability or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification for medical devices. As such, interested source must state which manufacturer(s) they are authorized dealers for and the repair parts that they are able to provide from the attached equipment list. Only brand name parts may be shipped to USAMMA's four CONUS facilities</p>
<p>3. Contractor Requirements: The contractor shall furnish medical equipment repair parts within 30 days after receipt of order when ordered by the Contracting Officer or a designated ordering officer during the five year ordering period. See Attachment 1 for a representative list of anticipated medical equipment repair parts required as of June 2017. While the Government anticipates adding additional items to this list, the spreadsheet provides a good indication of the Government's need.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: This request for information is open to both large and small businesses. The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112, Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing (size standard: 1,000 employees).</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a document describing relevant demonstrated experience and qualifications via email to rebecca.c.wisner.civ@mail.mil no later than 04 January 2018. Submissions should not exceed ten single sided pages - 8.5 inches x 11 inches pages. The submission should address all questions in the questionnaire below and your firm's ability to perform the requirement. All interested firms must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award of Government contracts.<br />No hard copy or facsimile submissions will be accepted. Cover letters and extraneous materials (brochures, etc) will not be considered. Questions concerning submissions should be directed to Ms. Rebecca Wisner, Contract Specialist at rebecca.c.wisner.civ@mail.mil. The Government will not entertain questions regarding this RFI/Market Research. Personal visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled. Emails or phone calls requesting personal visits will not receive a reply. <br />5. Each response should address the following Questionnaire:</p>
<p>a. What is your company's name?</p>
<p>b. What is your business address?</p>
<p>c. Please provide your DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM, at www.sam.gov) to be considered as potential sources.<br />d. Identify a point of contact regarding your response; his/her phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>e. Has your firm performed on projects of similar scope or complexity in the last five years? If so, provide a brief summary of each project to include the customer point of contact, services provided, dollar value, and location.</p>
<p>f. Please describe the size of your facility (approximate area in square feet) for storage and packaging.</p>
<p>g. Please list all manufacturer names from Attachment 1 for which your firm is an authorized dealer, and include a parts list of items that you can provide.</p>
<p>h. Please describe your commercial delivery timeframes (days after order) for the types of equipment items specified in Attachment 1. Please identify any manufacturer's with known lead times longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>i. Please provide feedback on the Statement of Need to include novel ideas, best practices, or industry capabilities to meet the Government need.</p>

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: J066 - Maintenance Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Maintenance, repair, and calibration of Rees Scientific freezer temperature  monitoring equipment</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB640000-18-00251</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: 12/08/2017</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Rees Scientific, located in Trenton, NJ to provide maintenance services covering the NIST owned Rees freezer monitoring system and associated equipment.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) Office of Reference Material (ORM) purpose is to provide customers with the means to obtain NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs)&reg;.  NIST supports accurate and compatible measurements by certifying and providing over 1,300 of the highest quality and metrological value Standard Reference Materials to industry, academia, and government. These materials are used to perform instrument calibrations in units as part of overall quality assurance programs, to verify the accuracy of specific measurements, and to support the development of new measurement methods.</p>
<p>Some SRMs are required to be stored in refrigerators and freezers. The NIST-owned Rees systems, which currently includes 78 freezers/refrigerators, monitors the temperature range in these refrigerators and freezers. In the event of failure, the system alarms/sends notifications by email and telephone when the temperature is out of range.</p>
<p>NIST intends to utilize a Blanket Purchase Agreement (per FAR 13.303)  to provide comprehensive maintenance service covering the Rees Monitoring System and associated equipment for a period of five years from the date of award, to include: <br />-	Existing Rees Scientific software on ORM provided computers (primary and back-up server) running MS Windows 7.<br />-	Database(wssql01) that contains existing freezers/refrigerators data<br />-	78 freezers/refrigerators probes (one probe/freezer) <br />-	Buffering transceivers, repeaters, and the battery backup for these items.<br />-	24/7 Technical Support via phone<br />-	On-site service to repair or replace, as requested within 24 hours<br />-	All required hardware, labor <br />-	Annual preventative maintenance services, including an annual comprehensive system test to include validation, calibration, and documentation of all system functions including readings, database, alarms, dial-outs, outputs, reports, and user programming to include:<br />-	Server Software upgrades when the most recent version is released</p>
<p>Sole Source justification is based on the following:<br />The manufacturer, Rees Scientific, has verified that only Rees Scientific is authorized to install, service, or maintain their instruments due to the proprietary nature of these instruments and the associated hardware/software required for operation.  Rees Scientific is the sole provider and distributor of the monitoring software which is proprietary.  Rees Scientific is the only company authorized to provide validation, calibration, and support for the NIST-owned Rees Scientific systems.</p>
<p>The resulting order will be a Blanket Purchase Agreement with fixed unit pricing and a total ceiling of $147,500.</p>
<p>NAICS code for this requirement will be 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Repair and Maintenance with a small business size of 20.5M</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 12/08/2017 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million). This market survey is being posted for Project: Construct a Tactical Equipment Maintenance Complex at Fort Hood, Texas. This will be a solicitation for a Construction contract for a single C- Type awarded contract for Fiscal Year 18.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Government plans to construct a Tactical Equipment Maintenance Complex at Fort Hood, Texas.</p>
<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>Project includes a Large Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, tactical organizational equipment parking with power/data connections, organizational storage, petroleum and hazardous material storage, an unmanned aerial vehicle storage building, Distribution Company storage building, special foundations, communications and cyber security measures. Intrusion Detection System (IDS), building information systems, fire protection and connection to Energy Management Control System (EMCS) is included. Supporting facilities include site development, utilities and connections-(electric, water, waste water, gas), storm drain system, paving, parking lots, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, site improvements, and landscaping. Measures in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Minimum Antiterrorism for Buildings standards will be provided. Comprehensive interior and furnishings related design services are required. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided. Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 50 years in accordance with DoD's Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 1-200-02) including energy efficiencies, building envelope and integrated building systems performance.</p>
<p>Magnitude: $25,000,000 - $100,000,000</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 540 Days from Notice to Proceed</p>
<p>Project Labor Agreement:</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Kristi Likes, at kristi.l.likes@usace.army.mil and courtesy copy (cc) the Contracting Officer, Mr. John H. Rodgers, at john.h.rodgers@usace.army.mil no later than 11:00 a.m., 12 December 2017.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Performance Based Work Statement for Open Market Contract
Storage of old Veteran/patient hard copy records.
February 2017

GENERAL:  The Contractor shall provide labor, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to provide storage of old Veteran/patient hard copy records for the William Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Administration Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina.

BACKGROUND:  The WJBD VAMC and satellite outpatient clinics (CBOCS) located in Anderson, Greenville, Florence, Orangeburg, Rock Hill, Sumter, and Spartanburg encompasses primary, secondary, some tertiary care, acute medical, surgical, psychiatric, and long-term care.  The main medical center is located in Columbia, South Carolina.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Base plus four option years.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Both the selected contractor s facility and the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center (WJBD VAMC), 6439 Garners Ferry Road, Columbia, SC 29209. 

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  

Currently we have 7,642 cubic feet of old Veteran/patient medical and administrative record stored by a contractor at a fully approved NARA facility.  These records are from the VA Medical Center in Columbia and the Greenville Outpatient Center. We also have approximately 200 boxes (200 cubic feet) of records on site at the VA Medical Center that will also need to be stored. The current contract will expire and a new contract will be needed to store these records.  The contractor s facility must be a fully certified NARA facility.
The currently stored records will need to be retrieved from the current storage facility and the 200 boxes that are on site at the Medical Center will need to be picked up.  All records will be logged into some type of data system (preferable system would be Bar Coding) for easy retrieval by Dorn employees and the contractor.  That data system should be able to show what types of records are being stored (Medical, Administrative, Fee, Dental, etc.) and how many volumes of each (Medical 1, 2, 3 etc.) The contractor will have a secure web site that we can use to request records for needs of the Veteran/patient, Release of Information, and Veterans Benefits Administration.  The contractor will provide secure mailing of the records, per our request, of records as listed in VA Directive 6609. The contractor will also furnish a CD of these listing the records in their data system.



Dorn VAMC will provide the following:  The area for the approximately 200 boxes of records to be loaded for pickup.  

Contractor will provide:  

A NARA certified storage facility for retired records;
Shipment of records from the current contractor s facility to the new facility;
Shipment of the records still at the VAMC Columbia to the contractor s facility;
A secure web site to order records, a data system to log in/out these records and the type/volume of records, and secure mailing of requested records.  
After all records are logged into contractor s facility a CD shall be provided of all records stored.

The following paragraphs are from VA Directive 6609 and define the  securely mailed  under 5b and 7.

Mail containing information under VA control must be shipped via the most secure, economical, and effective means practicable. VA requires the protection of SPI during the mailing process. As such, special procedures must be used for its protection. Mail, including both hardcopy and electronic media, that is lost, sent to the wrong recipient, or stolen can result in identity theft. Identity theft may result in personal hardship to individuals, including Veterans, dependents, and VA personnel. In order to ensure the adequate protection of mailing both within and from VA, the following procedures will be implemented Department-wide: 

a. Risk Analysis: Pursuant to the results of a risk analysis, a sender may provide additional security protections for categories of mail based upon its format and content. The risk analysis should be performed in consultation with the appropriate Privacy Officer, and if the mailing is in electronic form, the appropriate Information Security Officer should be included. If the risk analysis dictates, the media may be shipped via a delivery service that exceeds the minimum security requirements set forth in this Directive. The cost of any associated and additional services and will be the responsibility of the sender. If the purchase of containers is identified as a necessary security solution, all responsibilities associated with the custody of these containers will be the sender s responsibility.
 
d. Use of Secure Delivery and Package Tracking: Original documents, as defined in Paragraph 5b of this policy, must be sent via a secure delivery service that tracks mail from pick-up to delivery. Examples of services that provide this type of online tracking system are FedEx InSight, UPS Ground, and United States Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail. 

b. Original Document   The best evidence of the contents of a document is the original of that document. For purposes of this directive, the term refers to the originals of documents used for evidentiary purposes which, if lost or destroyed, would be difficult or impossible to replace. Examples include service, medical or personnel records, marriage certificates, birth certificates, passports, and diplomas. A VA claims folder is an original document, even if it only contains copies. 

CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MONITORING:  The government reserves the right to monitor services in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

7.  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS (EMSD):

Destruction of media is the ultimate form of sanitization. After media are destroyed, they cannot be reused as originally intended. Physical destruction can be accomplished using a variety of methods including disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and melting.

If destruction is decided upon, due to the high security categorization of the information or due to environmental factors, any residual medium must be able to withstand a laboratory attack. The following are destruction methods:


Shredding: Paper shredders may be used to destroy flexible media, such as diskettes, once the media are physically removed from their outer containers. The shred size of the refuse must be small enough so there is reasonable assurance, in proportion to the data confidentiality level, that the information cannot be reconstructed. Refer to VA Directive 6371 for shredding requirements. 

Optical mass storage media, including compact disks (CD, CD_R, CD-RW, and CD-ROM), DVDs, and magneto-optic (MO) disks to be destroyed by crosscut shredding.  When material is shredded, all residues must be reduced to nominal edge dimensions of five millimeters (5mm) and surface area of twenty-five square millimeters (25mm2).

The following electronic media that have reached the end of its life cycle for use within VA must be sanitized by degaussing and destruction: magnetic tape, reels, cassettes, cartridges, magnetic disks, and optical disks. Destruction of electronic media will be performed in accordance with the National Security Agency (NSA)/Central Security Service (CSS) Storage Device Declassification Manual, and NSA Evaluated Destruction Devices, available at www.nsa.gov. Destruction of media can only be conducted by trained and authorized personnel. Safety, hazmat, and special disposition needs should be identified and addressed prior to conducting any media destruction. The handling of hazardous materials, if any, must be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

The following procedures will be followed to destroy Electro Magnetic Sensitive Devices (EMSD)

Contractor will perform complete destruction of hard disc drives, and other hand held type devices such as Blackberry, iPhones, Personal Data Assistants (PDA s) and similar devices presented by OI&T personnel.  All Hard drives, and hand held devices will be destroyed on-site at 6439 Garners Ferry Road Columbia, SC 29209 and must be witnessed by staff from the medical center s OI&T service.  The medical center may require multiple destructions dates per year, based on needs.  Destruction dates will be coordinated between the contractor and the medical center point of contact.

 On the designated destruction date, the Electro Magnetic Sensitive Devices (EMSD) will be delivered to the shredding vehicle and they must be destroyed immediately while OI&T service personnel are present to witness the destruction of all the Electro Magnetic Sensitive Devices (EMSD).  

Upon completion, the contractor will send a Certificate of Destruction certifying the media was rendered un-recoverable to the following address:

 Dorn VA Medical Center
 6439 Garners Ferry Road
 Columbia, SC 29209
 Attention OI&T FCIO Stephen Chalfant

 The certificate of destruction must contain the serial numbers of each sensitive  device destroyed.  Residual pieces will be removed and recycled in full  compliance with all local, state and federal regulations.

Point of contact at the medical center is Stephen Chalfant, 803-776-4000 ext 6797.

 Estimated quantities of EMSDs to be destroyed are as follows:

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ.  The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.


VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as  Systems ), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods.  This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware.  The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.

The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system).  Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than 30 days.

When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days.  When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within 30 days.

All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure.  Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE


VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA s network.  If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract.  All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment.  All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration.  Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches.  Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon:  (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements.  This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes.  The options are:

  Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
  VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
  VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
  Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

 Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation.  Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools.  Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract

  A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.Â  The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information.  Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above.  Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach.  The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data.   Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis.  Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

  NATURE OF THE EVENT (LOSS, THEFT, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS);

  DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING:

     (A)  DATE OF OCCURRENCE;

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for these items are used in the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 system, which performs early detection, signal analysis, threat warning and protection from anti-ship missiles. The three (3) CRX800-1XM 6U Vita41.2 Serial RapidIO switch card provides control over the multiple processors within the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 system. The three (3) VR12A1F2K30AW17 VME with Core i7 processors are single board computers used to manage the Electronic Surveillance (ES) subsystem, High Gain/High Sensitivity (HGHS) subsystem, and decoy launchers. The combination of these items provides the core of the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 signal processing and are essential to the systems effectiveness. In order to utilize another vendor's solution to any one (and all of these), it would take three (3) years and $1M to modify software and firmware, perform regression testing and achieve Combat System certification. The risk of unsuccessful performance risk is too great to quantify. This procurement is required to maintain installation readiness for the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 aboard DDG-51 and DDG-1000 class ships.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:</p>
<p>Basic Services. The contractor shall provide services for an Emergency Notification System to accommodate 4,715 users. The service must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year with no interferences of service. The system must be a user friendly web-based interface to work with all applicable devices (computer desktop, laptops, cellphones, desk phones, tablets, etc.) and operating systems (Microsoft, IOS, and Android). The system must have the capability to send text and voice alert messages over multiple communications devices. The system must give the government ability to receive responses of alert notification with full report capability and full archival access capability. Scheduled maintenance must be performed without any interference of service.</p>
<p>Essential Services. The Department of Labor has identified certain services under this requirement as being essential to the Department's missions and operations. Such essential services must continue to be performed, even if an event occurs (or is threatened to occur) that would disrupt or interfere with operations at, or access to, facilities where services ordinarily take place. Such an event may include, but is not limited to, emergencies that may be natural (e.g., earthquake, flood, hurricane, tornado, public health emergencies including pandemic influenza), man-made (e.g., civil unrest, chemical spill, cyber or terrorist threats or attacks), or technological (e.g., building fire, utility outage), and which may affect one or more facilities or locations, including federal facilities, where the Contractor normally performs services hereunder.</p>
<p>a) Contingency Plans. Unless already included in the requirement, within 30 days of the commencement of performance (or the bi-lateral incorporation of this clause), the Contractor shall submit the following contingency plans to the Contracting Officer (CO) and the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR):</p>
<p>1) A contingency plan to continue performance for a period of between one and thirty days; and<br />2) A contingency plan to continue performance for more than thirty days, until the event described above is resolved.<br />Such contingency plans will become an obligation of the Contractor under the requirement.</p>
<p>b) Contents of the Contingency Plans. The contingency plans referenced in paragraph (b) above shall, at a minimum, address:</p>
<p>1) How the Contractor plans to continue performance of essential services for the duration of an event, including identifying and securing suitable off-site workplaces, personnel, and resources;</p>
<p>2) Alert and notification procedures for mobilizing and communicating with the Department and with essential personnel, and for communicating expectations to its personnel regarding their roles and responsibilities during the event;</p>
<p>3) A list of telephone numbers and email addresses (with alternates if available) for all managers currently performing under the requirement; and</p>
<p>4) Processes and requirements for the identification, training, and preparedness of essential personnel who would be capable of relocating to alternate facilities or performing work from home.</p>
<p>c) Approval of the Contingency Plans. The CO, in consultation as appropriate with the COR, shall review both contingency plans within 14 days of receipt, or as agreed, and shall either accept them or advise the Contractor of any reason for disapproval. If either plan is not accepted by the CO, the Contractor shall resubmit a revised plan within 7 days, or as agreed.</p>
<p>d) Activation of a Contingency Plan. The Agency Head, CO, COR, or other authorized agency official, may activate the Contractor's Contingency Plan by notifying the Contractor either orally or in writing. In the event of an oral instruction, a written confirmation of the activation will follow shortly after the resumption of normal activities. Once a contingency plan has been activated, services hereunder shall continue without delay or interruption, notwithstanding the "Excusable Delay" Clause, or any other provision of the contract (or requirement if this contract vehicle is BPA, BOA, or similar vehicle).</p>
<p>e) Failure to Execute a Plan. In the event the Contractor is unable or unwilling to perform the essential services identified under the requirement, as determined by the Department in its sole discretion, the Department reserves the right, in addition to any other right it may have, to use federal employees or other contract support, either from existing contracts or new contracts, to continue those critical services. The Department may view the Contractor's failure to implement the Contingency Plan as not performing a contractual requirement and reserves all rights to seek remedies associated with any such nonperformance. Any new contracting efforts would be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, OFPP's January 14, 2011 Emergency Acquisition Guide, or any other subsequent emergency guidance that may be issued.</p>
<p>f) Business Impact Analysis (BIA) Report. Contractor provides within 30 days of receipt, a report that demonstrates the process by analyzing mission-critical business functions, and identifies and quantifies the impact a loss of those functions (e.g., operational, financial) may have on the organization.</p>
<p>i. The BIA report should document the potential impacts resulting from disruption of business functions and processes. Scenarios resulting in significant business interruption should be assessed in terms of financial impact, if possible. These costs should be compared with the costs for possible recovery strategies.<br />ii. The BIA report should prioritize the order of events for restoration of the business.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS:<br />November 27, 2017<br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />January 5, 2018
<p><br />ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on China's Internet of Things.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, "The Commission ... shall investigate and report ... on..."</p>
<p>"(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(F) The strategic economic and security implications of the cyber capabilities and operations of the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(H) The drivers, nature, and implications of the growing economic, technological, political, cultural, people-to-people, and security relations of the People's Republic of China's with other countries, regions, and international and regional entities (including multilateral organizations)...."</p>
<p>This report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1. Describe China's development of the Internet of Things. Assess the success of Chinese central and local government (including research institutes and other entities connected to or controlled by the government) efforts to develop an Internet of Things ecosystem, particularly 5G, big data, integrated platforms, and semantic technologies. Evaluate China's efforts to reach the targets (including localization targets) or desired goals for Internet of Things as laid out in its industrial plans, including the Made in China 2025, Internet Plus, and any other relevant plans. What are the remaining challenges to reaching those targets or objectives? How is China's state-directed approach impacting U.S. firms' ability to access China's market and compete against Chinese firms? How is China's emergence as a leader in the Internet of Things impacting U.S. economic and national security interests in the short, medium, and long-term?</p>
<p>2. Describe the efforts of U.S. and Chinese players in setting international technical standards of Internet of Things and how these technologies and systems communicate. What is the importance of technical standards for technologies such as 5G and integrated platform technologies to the proliferation of Internet of Things? Compare and contrast U.S. and Chinese government and private sector efforts to set international standards. Assess the level of engagement between China and the United States in standards setting and design, development, and deployment. What differences, if any, are there between Chinese and U.S. technical standards for Internet of Things technologies? How will China's role in setting international standards impact U.S. businesses and U.S. competitiveness? How have Western firms and/or governments partnered with Chinese entities on developing standards and production capabilities for the Internet of Things?</p>
<p>3. Assess China's access to U.S. data. What are the types and volume of data Chinese firms are collecting or are capable of collecting on U.S. citizens and firms through Internet of Things technologies? How are Chinese firms expanding their access to U.S. data? What do these data reveal? How, if at all, does the social, legal, and regulatory environment in China affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored or transmitted by Chinese firms through Internet of Things technologies? How much access does the Chinese government have to data collected by Chinese firms? What are the U.S. legal protections for data collected by Chinese firms in the United States? Assess the effectiveness of these protections for preventing misuse and ensuring data privacy.</p>
<p>4. Assess the security and privacy of the Internet of Things. To what extent are the devices, how they are used, and how they transmit information susceptible to theft or exploitation? How are these vulnerabilities likely to evolve in the next 5-10 years? What are the potential vulnerabilities from U.S. usage of Chinese Internet of Things technologies, standards, and/or equipment? How, if at all, has the Chinese government leveraged Internet of Things technologies for the purposes of intelligence collection, censorship, or to launch or enable cyber attacks? What steps should the U.S. government take to mitigate the security and economic risks and improve U.S. competitiveness in Internet of Things technologies?</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this may be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 90 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($45.34 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall, within a year after publication of the report, agree to participate in up for two (2) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key research requirements").</p>
<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report. It is understood that the designation of the researchers is a critical element of the proposal, and any changes regarding which individuals will be involved in the report's preparation must be approved by the Commission in advance and in writing.</p>
<p>3. A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ. In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used.</p>
<p>4. A list of any entities for whom you have conducted research or provided consulting services in the past. The Commission understands you may be limited in providing such information by confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p>5. An estimate of the time the applicant will need to complete the required work.</p>
<p>6. The price the applicant will charge to the Commission to complete the work set forth in this RFP.</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals wishing to submit a proposal in response to this RFP must ensure that the response arrives at the location noted below by 5:30PM (EST) on January 5, 2018, or it will not be accepted or considered.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions are acceptable.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03818QB2000038 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-96 effective 06 November 2017.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or an OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, genuine OEM parts, and is the only OEM authorized distributor for F0210 parts required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607; "Requirements - 70Z03818QB2000038" and<br />&#61607; "Terms and Conditions - 70Z03818QB2000038".</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 04 December 2017 at 2:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 05 December 2017. Quotes and questions shall be submitted by email to james.r.callison@uscg.mil. Please indicate solicitation 70Z03818QB2000038 in the subject line. Phone calls WILL NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />_X__52.204-7 -- System for Award Management (Oct 2016)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent Federal agency which manages the U.S. Government's foreign assistance program, providing assistance for developing countries around the world in the areas of economic growth and trade, agriculture and the environment, education and training, democracy and governance, reconstruction and stabilization, global health, global partnerships and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Within USAID, the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) oversees the solicitation, selection, award and administration of contracts, grants and cooperative agreements in support of the agency's development assistance objectives.  Procurement actions may involve the private or the public sectors, international organizations, non-government and private voluntary organizations, educational institutions, and host country organizations (both private and public sector). Because of the unique aspect of implementing procurement actions in an overseas context, USAID has implemented a supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the AID Acquisition Regulations (AIDAR).  In the course of a year, total procurement actions (both acquisition and assistance) may exceed $11 billion.</p>
<p>The Washington headquarters Office of Acquisition and Assistance deals with both domestic and non-domestic (foreign and international) procurement actions, requiring the ability to recognize and understand a broad spectrum of very different cultures, and to accommodate contractual requirements to very different implementing environments, reconciling Federal procurement policies and procedures with host country policies and procedures, usually in highly visible and complex countries, and often involving coordination among numerous donor countries and organizations.</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as a Contract Specialist working on actions for the Office of Transition Initiatives, Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA/OTI), working in the in the Management Bureau, Office of Acquisition Assistance (M/OAA).

This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations.  For M/OAA to support DCHA/OTI in implementing its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA prompt procurement support is provided.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC><p>***THE FOLLOWING CHANGES AND UPDATES ARE APPLIED TO THIS AMENDMENT***<br /><br />1. This amendment withdraws the unrestricted status and changes the solicitation to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business set aside. The NAICS is also changed from 621493 to 621512.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Period of Performance: The intended start date is December 2017. This can be&nbsp;coordinated with project officer, Jerry Smith&nbsp;after award is made.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Mobilization/Demoblization: Mobilization periods will be conducted within a 2-week timeframe.<br /><br />4. Evaluation Factors: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in the order of importance:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) - Technical Capability. Offeror must submit a detailed response to the information covered in the Statement of Work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) - Past Performance. The Contractor must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or Commercial. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must include at least three references.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) - Cost/Price. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers. Price is not assigned an adjectival rating or scored; it will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable and if it reflects the offeror's understanding of the work. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD<br />Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria. The quotations will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach to permit tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors. This will allow the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror who meets or exceeds the technical acceptability standards established in the factors referenced above.</p>
<p>This amendment extends the closing date to&nbsp;December 04, 2017 at 4pm MST. <br /><br />**Be sure to make note of changes made from the original posting when submitting proposals**</p>

***TYPE OF MOBILE CT SCANNER***<br /><br />The Billings Area Indian Health Service's requirement is for a 64-slice Mobile CT. The make and models of CT's that the IHS CT Technologists are qualified on currently are Phillips Brilliance Six and GE VCT 64 slice, but all models will be considered.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>PD EA anticipates a requirement for production and sustainment, hardware and services, of the following Duke systems and their assorted variants: Duke V4 (AN/VLQ-12(V)4) Primary Unit (PU) RT-2040, Duke V5 (AN/VLQ-12 (V)5) PU RT-2040 and Secondary Unit (SU) RT-1950, Duke V5 Sabre Fury variant (to include the Fire Support Team Cross Domain Expansion (FIST X) (formerly CMIC EW Vehicle), Sabre Fury on tactical vehicles, and EW Tactical Vehicle (EWTV) variations), and Ground Auto Targeting Observation Reactive (GATOR) Jammer V3 (AN/FLQ-15(V)3). The Sabre Fury, Duke V4, and Duke V5 are programmable software defined ground EW systems that will provide sensing and electronic negation of Signals of Interest (SoIs). The GATOR V3 system is a fixed site that provides EW capabilities in a fixed site configuration. The Duke FoS provides Offensive and Defensive Electronic Attack (OEA/DEA), as well as, EW support to protect vehicles, convoys, and fixed sites from EW threats. These systems will operate both individually and in networked, mixed fleet, configurations for a variety of ground EW missions to include counter-command and control (C2) operations against near-peer systems.</p>
<p>Efforts under this requirement will support the above systems and any future variants, ancillary items, Components of End Item (CoEIs), Associated Support Items of Equipment (ASIOE), etc., and include: Hardware; Product Support Management; Procurement; System Troubleshooting and Repair; Engineering and Software Support Services; Maintenance Planning and Management; Materiel Maintenance; Logistics; Worldwide Field Service Support; Supply Support; Spares and Repair Parts; Support Equipment Procurement; Hardware and Software Technical Data Maintenance and Procurement; Training and Training Support; Platform Integration and Installation, and Depot Facilitation if required. The Government will define specific requirements in individual Task Orders (TOs) for services or Delivery Orders (DOs) for materials. Material orders may include hardware such as spare repair parts (i.e. Line Replaceable Units and Shop Replaceable Units (LRUs/SRUs)) and/or whole Duke and/or Sabre Fury end item systems.</p>
<p>The Government envisions a hybrid IDIQ five-year contract, with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Cost Reimbursement (CR) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Task Orders and Delivery Orders issued under this IDIQ contract will specifically identify contract CLIN type by task. The Government shall utilize FFP CLINs to purchase materials (e.g., spare parts) and FFP on select well defined/limited scope service tasks. The Government will utilize Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs to purchase Services and CR CLINs for travel, and other direct costs (ODCs) in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.302, "Cost Contract".</p>
<p>The Sabre Fury System: The Sabre Fury mounted system is based off the Counter Radio-Controlled EW (CREW) AN/VLQ-12(V)4/(V)5 Countermeasures System, referred to as the "Duke V4/V5 (DV4/V5)." As a result of emerging needs, the U.S. Army is seeking to adapt the Duke V4/V5 system hardware and software to provide increased capabilities in the areas of EW, to include signal detection, status and event reporting, and electronic response. The Sabre Fury consists of the receivers, transmitters, antennas, remote control unit, direction-finding (DF) sensors, and cabling.<br />The Sabre Fury system differs in mission employment from the CREW Duke system in that the primary objective is to detect SoIs and report them to a user. Additionally, by leveraging the transmission capabilities of the Duke V4/V5 hardware, the Sabre Fury possesses the capacity to perform EW missions at a user's request. While the existing Duke V4/V5 inherently supports some aspects of this mission, several modifications and developments are required to bring this capability to bear as part of an integrated EW networked system. Examples of these include changes to the system's configuration, integration with a DF sensor, and development of the mechanisms to provide user monitoring and management of the Sabre Fury from a U.S. Army external tactical EW system.</p>
<p>The Stryker-based FIST X or CMIC EW vehicle focuses on the Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) mission through the use of firmware, software and loadsets or threat loads specifically designed to optimize performance against emerging threats. FIST X is also enabled to conduct operations against other emerging tactical threats. The system includes Duke V5 electronics, tactical antennas, omni-directional antennas, and the SRC Inc. DF subsystem all under the control of the Maneuver Aviation Fires Integrated Application (MAFIA) C2 software for autonomous or man-in-the-loop operation. The FIST X Sabre Fury is readily reprogrammed and optimized for ground EW missions.</p>
<p>The Sabre Fury system will also be installed in tactical vehicles to provide distributed, networked EW operations. Sabre Fury EW systems may be installed on any tactical platform by leveraging the Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) Duke A-kit with minor modifications. Remote networked operation can be accomplished with an existing EW Command and Control system and Planning Suites networked via standard tactical radio.</p>
<p>The EWTV variant is a Sabre Fury-based EW system hosted on a MaxxPro Dash MRAP and is based on the fixed-site GATOR's server-based architecture. It can be operated as a mobile EW command and control node for the networked EW assets. In addition to the standard Sabre Fury Electronic Support (ES) and Electronic Attack (EA) functions, the EWTV will also be capable of executing the specialized GATOR missions.<br /><br />GATOR V3: The GATOR V3 system is a fixed site jamming capability. It provides easy set up/tear-down in approximately three hours. It is a self-contained, turn-key system that is equipped with its own power, shelter, and self-erecting tower on-board. Intuitive design provides pertinent information to the user on one screen while map overlays provide useful common operational picture. The GATOR V3 system architecture design supports networking; enabling the user to update the server, software defined radio, firmware, maps, shape files, and graphical user interface. Finally the GATOR V3 provides active monitoring capabilities through Electromagnetic Energy sensing, real-time indications and warnings capability, Battle Damage Assessment and Measure of Effectiveness/Measure of Performance validation.</p>
<p>Limitations: The Government does not own complete detailed design/fabrication documentation, software source code, or the technical data package for the Duke FoS listed above to provide to a third party. Technical data is the property of the original equipment manufacturer, SRC Inc., North Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p>Major Milestones: Anticipated RFP Release Date: 3QFY18</p>
<p>The security requirements for this effort will be as follows: Facility Clearance required shall be TOP SECRET SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS/SCI) with TS/SCI safeguarding capability.</p>

11/08/2017: The purpose of this revision is to provide Amendment #1 to SIR No. DTFAWA-18-R-00001. Redline and clean versions are attached. Changes to the SIR consist of including specific dates in paragraph 7 Milestone Schedules (Table 1) and clarifying information in paragraphs 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.

11/07/2017: The purpose of this revision is to make publicly available the first iteration (V1) of the UASIPP Interested Parties List. The list has been added as an attachment.

11/02/2017: On October 25, 2017 the President directed the establishment of the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP) to test further integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions (this includes U.S. Territories and holdings).

This new pilot program encourages State, local, and tribal governments, in partnership with UAS operators and other private sector stakeholders, to conduct advanced operations safely and with public support in affected communities.  The Department Of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is announcing in a Federal Register Notice establishment of the UAS Integration Pilot Program, and identifies this site (https://faaco.faa.gov) to obtain the specific instructions for requesting access to a designated portal for submitting an application (in form of a proposal) to be considered for participation in the program. 

The first formal step for considering participants is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR). The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request For Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request prospective applicants to submit specific information for evaluation.  Applicants must be State, local or tribal Governments to be considered for award. Government applicants may team with industry.
The specific instructions for requesting access to the application portal are contained in the attached SIR. Applicants are required to provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number with their request for portal access. This SIR (and any future changes) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (https://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (SIR Table 1) should be reviewed immediately. The schedule within the SIR will be updated with hard dates when the Federal Register Notice (FRN) is formally published. The FRN publish date is expected to be on or about November 8, 2017.

The FAAâ€™s common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating, and selecting Applicants is contained in the agencyâ€™s Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate selection for the UASIPP Lead Participants will be at the discretion, and order, of the Secretary of Transportation.

Applicants who have been selected by the Secretary will enter, under Other Transaction Authority, into Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with the FAA.  Each MOA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective participant conducts the pilot program. A sample MOA is provided as an attachment.

The FAA anticipates awards of five or more MOAs resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR). The period of performance is anticipated to be for three (3) years.
The Government will not provide any funding for project performance.
Each applicant must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in the attached SIR. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the SIR.
To be considered for award, applicants must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and not listed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Prospective applicants are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.   It is the prospective applicants' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the respondents expense.

This solicitation is due back 12/11/2017.

Background:  Runway Status Lights System Description
Concept of Operations:  Runway Status Lights is an essential FAA system which uses Airport Surface Surveillance data to determine vehicle and aircraft locations. Runway Status Lights processes this data using complex software algorithms with adjustable parameters to control airfield lights in accordance with Air Traffic operations, including anticipated separation. Red airfield lights (Runway Entrance Lights and Takeoff Hold Lights) illuminate and extinguish as vehicles and aircraft traverse the airfield.
System:  Runway Status Lights integrates airport lighting equipment with approach and surface surveillance systems to provide a visual signal to pilots and vehicle operators indicating that it is unsafe to enter/cross or begin takeoff on runway. The system is fully automated based on inputs from surface and terminal surveillance systems. Airport surveillance sensor inputs are processed through light control logic that commands in-pavement lights to illuminate red when there is traffic on or approaching the runway.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), with a size standard of $38.5M.

The current qualified source(s) are ADB Safegate (CAGE 5ED70) and Saab Sensis (CAGE 6ZQN9). The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Sikorsky S-76D Simulator 

REVISION #1 POSTED 11/27/2017:
THIS REVISON PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CLARIFICATION TO THE RFI. PLEASE SEE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN ATTACHMENT B POSTED BELOW.

1.0 Purpose and Introduction: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking industry capability statements and technical approaches to determine the most viable solutions in the current marketplace for the installation of a Wide Angle Collimation (WAC) with a collimating mirror, beam splitter, and light source. 

** IMPORTANT -- This is a Request for Information (RFI) being issued for â€œMarket Research Purposesâ€ only. This is neither a Request for Quote (RFQ) nor a Request for Proposal (RFP). **

This RFI is for information only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this notice, and is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant task order or any other contract. Responses to this request are informational in nature and will not be considered offers, nor will they be accepted by the Government to form a binding agreement. Actual pricing of this requirement is not requested, nor will any be reviewed under this request.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a need to develop a state of the art simulator using the front half of a Sikorsky S-76D. Due to the current space constraints, the FAA seeks the best installation method (i.e. free-standing with mount points, or fitted to current frame, etc.) for WAC visual systems for the two downward-facing â€œchin windowsâ€ on the front of the helicopter. The information submitted in response to this RFI is for the FAAâ€™s informational, market research, and planning purposes only. The information obtained from this RFI may be used to support the installation requirements. Therefore, submissions should be high level in nature and not contain any proprietary information. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFI(s) and/or Screening Information Requests (SIRs) related to this simulator; if any are issued.

2.0 Background: 

The FAA seeks to understand its options to install the WAC window comprised of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items such as the Barco FS750 projector, collimating mirror, beam splitter, and light source. The system must be installed to support the functional requirements identified in the Sikorsky S-76D Simulator dimensions and space limitations outlined in Attachment A. The FAA anticipates the Sikorsky S-76D Simulator to be a multiphase project, with incremental enhancements to be determined at a later time. As such, the installation must be modular with the capability for further integration with components as determined.

3.0 Submittal Requirements and Instructions: 

The FAA requests interested vendors provide a (1) Capability Statement and (2) Technical Approach. The submission must follow the suggested outline below.
Additionally, the FAA encourages vendor comments and suggestions regarding this effort, including alternative approaches to meeting the FAA requirements. Comments and suggestions must be provided separately from the Capability Statement and Technical Approach. Comments and suggestions do not have a page limit.

3.1 Capability Statement: 

Please provide a brief description of your companyâ€™s ability to execute the performance objectives below. This description should include examples demonstrating your experience. Please limit discussion to relevant current or previous experience within the last five (5) years. The capability statement should address the following:

a. Developing simulators comprised of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)/modified COTS, and developmental components that are open, configurable, and customizable to address the evolving needs of the Global Aviation Community.
b. Previous experience installing a Wide Angle Collimation (WAC) window with a collimating mirror, and beam splitters.

3.2 Technical Approach: 

Please describe your technical approach (at a high level) including methodology for addressing the Installation and Alignment Questions and Specifications in Attachment A. Also, if your proposed solution includes features that are not part of the current FAA specifications/requirements, and might be beneficial to the FAA, please describe these features and how incorporation might improve the simulator. Additionally, please cite examples of successful solutions provided during past performance for similar efforts, noting any tools, techniques, and innovation used.  

4.0 Delivery of Submission: 

RFI responses must be submitted via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Anthony Doran at Anthony.Doran@faa.gov no later than November 30, 2017 by 5 pm EST. The FAA welcomes any general comments regarding the content of the RFI. Questions or comments must be submitted in writing via email prior to the closing date and directed to email Anthony.Doran@faa.gov.
 
5.0 Other: 

It is highly recommended that interested vendors check the FAAâ€™s Contracting Opportunities website frequently for any updates to this RFI. Also, if this announcement is being viewed from other than the FAAâ€™s Contracting Opportunities website, some information and/or attachments may not transfer correctly. Therefore, only the information and attachments provided at http://faaco.faa.gov are considered the â€œofficialâ€ source of information on this requirement.

<DESC>Request for Proposals #140P8318R0001 is to replace windows, skylights, and exterior doors at the North Cascade Visitor Center.  This building was built in 1991 and is 11,930 square feet. The glass elements to be replaced are original. The building will be closed to the public during construction although NPS employees may work on-site intermittently. Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals, which will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately October 23, 2017.
PROJECT LOCATION: The North Cascades Visitor Center is located in Newhalem, WA, approximately 65 miles east of Sedro-Woolley WA within Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Maps and information are posted at www.nps.gov/NOCA.
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held at 11:00 am on November 1, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation. Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory). Requests for individual hosted site visits will not be honored; however, contractors may view the building's exterior and site individually any time. The visitor center is open to the public October 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 28, 2017, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, and then closes until early May, 2018. 
TARGET WORK DATES: The period of performance will be 60 days after commencing on-site work and substantial completion must occur by May 4, 2018. The Notice to Proceed will likely be issued in January and the Contractor may select their on-site starting date. We anticipate that the work will occur in March and April, 2018, due to winter weather conditions at the site.
DETAILS: This is a best value negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 238150, Glass and Glazing Contractors, and the small business size standard is $15 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years. All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act. In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $150,000 and $250,000.
The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.  The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not established and/or maintained an active registration at www.SAM.gov prior to the offer due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering. The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List where you can add your company's interest. Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Prospective offerors will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no other notifications will be sent.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.   
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Small Business AdministrationÂ¿s (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<p>Objective 1: Expand volume of quality, high-impact RMNCH services delivered by private sector providers</p>
<p>Objective 2: Increase availability of affordable and quality and health products through private sector channels</p>
<p>Objective 3: Strengthen public-private engagement to promote universal RMNCH outcomes</p>
<p>Objective 4: Innovative, successful, private sector models are identified, tested, and applied</p>
<p>This activity will play a vital role in supporting the USG's and Agency's goal of achieving of expanding access to high impact interventions and ultimately reducing preventable deaths by expanding delivery of high impact reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services and products through the private sector . Working with private sector health associations, providers, pharmacists, wholesalers, NGO's, market research companies and the government, USAID aims to strengthen the quality of high impact RMNCH health services and products nationwide. A key approach to this effort is improving regulatory environment to enable a stronger private health sector as well as expand public-private partnerships.</p>

If there are no available options containing Census' unique requirements as outlined in the RLP and below, the Government reserves the right to identify an acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government is using the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) to satisfy the above Census space requirement. The AAAP application, located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, enables interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP Package 17-CENSUS.</p>
<p>Offered space must comply with RLP Package 17-CENSUS, posted on https://aaap.gsa.gov,  and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) intends to solicit information from multiple sources through a Request for Information (RFI).  The RFI is not a solicitation for a contract or grant award and is for informational purposes only.
Through the RFI, the Government intends to seek information from companies about a potential future High Performance Computing (HPC) system activity.  The Government intends to request information on current industry capabilities and performance on several areas of scope relating to the system hardware and software as well as training and support services, which is being considered for a future contract. Areas of scope may include HPC System Development, Technical Support for the developed system, Training and other materials. The government will also be soliciting feedback on Burst Buffer, Compute partition, and Storage System upgrade options. 
Furthermore, in the RFI, the government intends to seek feedback regarding the acquisition approach for a potential HPC system contract, and solicit alternative approaches that may reduce cost and risk.

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 03   Page 1 of 1
Revision 03 Date: 10/27/2014
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
512-18-1-098-0025
1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER

1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$46,920
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Full service coverage of 2 Medivators Advantage endoscope reprocessors at the Baltimore VA Medical Center including remote support and annual preventive maintenance with detailed service reports to be retained by the Baltimore VAMC Biomedical Engineering department. 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

These medical systems are proprietary technology and maintenance must be performed by a Medivators trained and certified field engineer. Medivators is also the only vendor with an agreement with the VA to provide remote support for these systems. 
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Medivators is the equipment manufacturer and is the only vendor that can provide remote support. 

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Verified that only Medivators can provide remote support for these systems

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
