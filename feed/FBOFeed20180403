New drainage improvements will consist of grading, installing area inlets and drainage pipe. Further guidance will be posted on FedBizOps prior to the Pre-Bid conference/Site Visit. There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government or ASRC should funding not be provided. In the absence of funding no contract will result. Should funds be provided, to be considered for award of this project a contractor must have satisfactory previous experience in the types of work contained in this solicitation and have a successful track record performing the types of work contained in the project?

<CONTACT>Jamie Hoff, Technical Advisor, Phone (937) 255-9863, Email Jamie.Hoff@us.af.mil - Tom Dalrymple, Technical Advisor, Phone (937)713-8750, Email Thomas.Dalrymple@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate, Materials &amp; Manufacturing Directorate (AF ManTech), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) are seeking to transition technology developed under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales program to a third-party supplier in order to facilitate access across the DoD industrial base and continued upgrading of the technology. To this end, AFRL and DARPA are requesting information on means by which this transition can be structured to best serve the needs of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ACT program is to reduce the time and cost of phased array development through the development of a common hardware module containing the subcomponents of a phased array system that provide the most opportunity for reducing non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs. Such a module, called a "Common Module (CM)," serves as a high-performance, programmable, digital-based solution that can transition to a broad range of array and RF systems with minimal NRE costs. The CM leverages existing commercial technology investments in digital systems while incorporating advanced technology components funded through the DoD. Thus, the CM can be readily upgraded as commercial technology advances while still retaining its state-of-the-art, DoD-specific performance.</p>
<p>The prime contractor under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program has developed a CM solution that serves as a broadband, 32-channel digital receiver/exciter and beamforming module capable of replacing large sections of analog array and other RF front-end electronics. This CM is adaptable to a range of frequency bands and is programmable to fit a wide variety of DoD applications. In order to make the CM available to a wide industry base, the DoD wishes to explore transition of the CM to a third party for commercialization and production manufacturing. While tailored for phased array applications, the CM may also be adapted to industry standard form factors for broader application use cases. In this manner, the CM will become an "off the shelf" solution that can be incorporated by U.S government contractors to serve a variety of DoD purposes.</p>
<p>Detailed technical information on the CM will be provided on a case-by-case basis to those organizations interested and capable of responding to this RFI. These organizations must be able to receive and maintain export-controlled information.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The solicitation will be available for review on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). Potential offerors are encouraged to submit offers via email to the address listed on the solicitation. Therefore IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception: (i)	Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized. Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically. The solicitation number for this requirement will be: SPRTA1-18-Q-0310.

<DESC><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine  (PPQ), Facility Located in Edinburg, TX  is in need of a Firm Fixed Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement to supply Brown Tree Bands - ( pre-coated sticky bands) 164'ft  x 8.5" wide for a period not to exceed five years.
<p>Quantities to be ordered on delivery orders is pursuant to the demand for the product at the time the delivery orders are to be issued.   It is possible that these supplies may not be required in any fiscal year.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>Certain insect traps have been shown to be an effective monitoring tool for non-indigenous insects.  Various trap combinations have enabled the USDA to better contain and monitor potential infestations of these insects. Spotted Lanternfly and other flying insects are some of the most serious exotic plant pests threatening forest and environmental resources.  The USDA APHIS PPQ has been tasked by congress with detecting, monitoring and managing these insects. The impact of these insects, should they become established, would have irreversible impacts on natural resources, hinder trade and increase costs of productions. Ultimately, an eradication and/or control would likely be in the millions of dollars if these insects were to go undetected in our environment.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The requested traps are needed to equip program personnel to detect and monitor many existing and potential exotic pest infestations.  Without these traps, defining infestations might not be possible and the ultimate cost to the USDA and cooperators of an eradication program could exceed millions of dollars should these lures not be available.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award a sole source fixed price contract to the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), Tucson, AZ 85718 for outreach and educational activities to MDA's patient base and ALS community partners to support the National ALS Registry. The period of performance for this procurement is sixty (60) months, including one base period of 12 months and four 12-month option periods. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a size standard of $15M.
<p><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to promote the National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Registry to increase enrollment numbers through the Muscular Dystrophy Association's (MDA) extensive nationwide network of offices, clinics, and Centers of Excellence so that the agency can fulfill the congressional mandate under the ALS Registry Act, Public Law No. 110-373.</p>
<p>The most direct way to reach the critical majority of ALS patients is to conduct outreach in the clinics, centers, and offices where ALS patients are being treated and supported. As a leading healthcare provider of ALS treatment, support, advocacy and education in the United States supporting almost forty percent of the ALS-identified patients, MDA's nationwide network of clinics, offices, and Centers of Excellence offers assistance to a large number of ALS patients and their families, along with supporting the local ALS clinical community. MDA's very large and unique ALS patient cohort located throughout the United States provides MDA with sole and exclusive proprietary access to these patients, their medical records and their contact information. This information is protected by medical privilege, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and not commercially available in the marketplace, so only MDA has access to its specific nationwide client base of ALS patients. MDA's established relationship of trust and confidence with its ALS patients and their families places MDA in a unique position to provide ATSDR with substantial assistance in promoting the National ALS Registry to MDA's ALS constituents (e.g., ALS patients, their family members and caregivers, and ALSA clinical staff). MDA is the sole source to access the MDA-ALS patient/family cohort and no other contractor can provide this service to meet the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>MDA's stellar work and efforts in the treatment, cure, advocacy and education related to ALS have earned it tremendous respect and credibility in the field of ALS throughout the entire ALS Community. MDA has thus cultivated, fostered and developed an extensive network of professional relationships and partnerships with others in the general ALS community over the years, regularly engaging ALS physicians and other ALS health professionals and MDA clinics throughout the country. These relationships provide outreach, education, support, and assistance to people with ALS patients, their families, and the local ALS clinical community beyond the MDA ALS-patient cohort.</p>
<p>ATSDR needs MDA's relationships, links, knowledge, experience, patients and community support to fulfill ATSDR's congressional mandate to build the National ALS Registry as provided for in the ALS Registry Act, Public Law No. 110-373. With access to its ALS patients and community network, MDA will help CDC/ATSDR narrow a significant data gap in the National ALS Registry, thus ensuring the objectives of this national public health ALS initiative are fully met.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. CDC will issue only one solicitation to the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Betty Vannoy via email ONLY at bbv9@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2018-N-67818 referenced in the subject line NO LAER THAN April 19, 2018, 10AM EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>
<p>Special Note: The CDC previously posted a sources sought synopsis (HHS-CDC-ATSDR-SS-18-001-BV) for this requirement on March 1, 2018.</p>

<DESC>Forest Road 2160, MP 0.3, Culvert Replacement
<p>The project consists of removing an existing culvert and replacing it with 72-inch diameter culvert and installing a new 72-inch diameter, 86-foot, 0.138 thickness culvert. The government will provide final design drawings of the culvert with the solicitation.</p>
<p>Work will include working within an approved work window under the guidelines of a hydraulic permit, a limited road closure and include fish and wildlife provisions. Work on the ground is expected to begin as early as July 1, 2018 with the entire project completion by September 30, 2018.</p>

The road closure to complete all the work onsite is limited to 7 days or less.</p>
<p>An esitmated 90 cubic yards of material has eroded from the fill slope and is actively eroding. A estimated 150 cubic yards of fill will be unsuitable as there are continual holes up to 16" in diameter in the bottom of the culvert. There are no weed free fill sources locally and nearest weed free pit is in Amanda Park 17 miles away. The Park Pit is located 2.4 miles away is the best waste site in the area. There is 420 cubic yards of material that needs to be removed not including the pipe volume. There are a borrow sources 10 miles away on the 2170 and 2140 ridge top roads but these are not weed free pits. No design drawing are included and culvert construction will use Type I.</p>

The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The NIST Radiation Physics Division (RPD) maintain an active research programs in terahertz spectroscopy, neutron physics, radiation dosimetry, and radionuclide metrology. In support of this mission the Neutron Physics Group is building a double monochromator assembly to image strain in large metallic specimens and for energy resolved tomography to nondestructively determine mineralogy in high value, bulk geological specimens (fossils, meteors, moon rocks, etc.). To achieve the resolution required for strain, and to fully image large objects requires monolithic large area, low mosaic spread crystals. Specifically, these crystals must be highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).</p>
<p>Panasonic is the sole source Contractor for this product. The reason is the HOPG crystal is a rarely used size and type of monochromator crystal. Based on market research to include a sources sought, no other suppliers were found that could provide commercial ZYA grade Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals and ZYB crystals. Panasonic is the only manufacturer and distributor of the required products in the world.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Continuously Tunable Laser and Wavelength Meter
<SOLNBR>SB1341-18-RQ-0319
<RESPDATE>041718
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Toptica Photonics, 5847 County Rd. 41, Farmington, NY 14425 for the purchase of a continuously tunable laser and wavelength meter system for NIST's Quantum Measurement Division (QMD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>NIST requires a continuously tunable laser and wavelength meter system for use in quantum optomechanics and optomechanical sensor projects. The Quantum Optics Group of the Quantum Measurement Division is developing and characterizing measurement methods that take advantage of the quantum nature of light so as to achieve better performance, uncertainties, or to enable new applications that are not possible with classical methods. To meet this mission a laser capable of probing a variety of quantum optics and quantum cavity optomechanics experiments, as well as to probe silicon nanophotonic sensors is needed and a wavelength meter that is compatible will be used to determine and set the laser wavelength.</p>
<p>Toptica Photonics is the sole source Contractor for this product. The reason is they are the only company capable of providing laser with high output power to supply both a probe to interrogate devices with low overall coupling efficiency and a strong optical local osclllator for homodyne or heterodyne detection. To facilitate long integration time and low noise measurements, the laser wavelength must be able to be actively stabilized to one of these narrow resonances with a high speed actuator provided as part of the system. The laser must also have low intensity and frequency noise at high frequencies to deliver quantum-limited performance and low sensor readout noise floor. The laser must be automatically and reproducibly tunable over a wide wavelength range to locate and characterize spectral features of on-chip optomechanical devices produced with wide fabrication tolerances. The system must include a wavelength meter capable of fast measurements and high accuracy to ensure long term reproducibility of the laser system, and allow active stabilization of the laser wavelength to the wavelength meter. In addition to these requirements the system must also include hardware and software control platform into their tunable laser systems that allows for turnkey laser stabilization and automatic reoptimizatlon of the laser cavity parameters to ensure long-term stable, mode-hop free laser operation over a wide tuning range, making them the sole vendor capable of satisfy requirements. Toptica Photonics does not provide these lasers through any of their resellers, so there is only one responsible vendor.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<SUBJECT>Anti-Fraud Hotline Activity
<SOLNBR>RFI-391-18-AFHA

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a preliminary call for expressions of interest to provide services for the activity titled, "Anti-Fraud Hotline."
<p>USAID's new Anti-Fraud Hotline activity will improve accountability and transparency in USAID-funded programs in Pakistan through greater local involvement and ownership, helping to ensure responsible management of USG investments.  This activity will develop, manage, and advertise a fraud reporting program that enables individuals to report allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in USAID-funded programs in Pakistan.  USAID anticipates accomplishment of this purpose through public outreach, including potentially a hotline, electronic media, e-mail, and conventional mail.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of this activity is expected to reduce the risk and incentives for fraud, waste, and abuse as well as mitigate and prevent corruption related to USAID-funded activities.  It also expects to foster greater citizen engagement in the oversight process, and encourage the public to report allegations of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>USAID/Pakistan intends to issue one award (Acquisition / Assistance) for the provision of these services.  USAID/Pakistan may set aside this procurement for U.S. Small business entities.  The period of performance under this award is estimated to be a five year period with an estimated award range between $3-4 million USD.</p>
<p>Please see attached RFI package for more details.</p>

The project site development will include, but not limited to, site layout and grading, pavements for vehicle and fire apparatus access, site drainage system, reinforced cast-in-place concrete foundation, and relocation of existing groundwater monitoring wells.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated in Phase-one to determine which offerors (maximum of five) will be down-selected to submit proposals for Phase-two. An amendment will be issued to those selected offerors providing the detailed project performance requirements package (Phase-two).

Evaluation Factors for Phase-two consist of Technical Solution, Key Personnel and Small Business Participation Plan. A Price Proposal is required in Phase-two.

Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness. In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. Please note: the Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns will be applied to this procurement in accordance with FAR 19.1307(b) and FAR 52.219-4.</p>

<SUBJECT>Middle Wall Crack Stabilization, Montgomery Locks and Dam
<SOLNBR>W911WN18B8001
<CONTACT>Janie L. Roney, Contract Specialist, Phone 4123957474, Email janie.l.roney@usace.army.mil - Carole M. Householder, Contracting Officer, Phone 412-395-7274, Email carole.householder@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a project that involves stabilization of two critical sections of the middle wall at Montgomery Locks and Dams, Ohio River, Pennsylvania. Montgomery Locks and Dam is located on the Ohio River near Monaca PA, at river mile 31.7 below the "Point" in Pittsburgh, PA. The locks are open to commercial navigation and recreation traffic, which are staffed and operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The facility has two lock chambers with the locks located on the left descending bank. The land lock chamber has a size of 110'x600' and the river lock chamber has a size of 56'x360'. The existing middle lock wall supports the continual operation of the two lock chambers at the facility. The lock walls are constructed of concrete walls bearing directly on the rock for foundation support.
<p>Existing cracks are located with many areas of the lock walls. The cracks are orientated vertically and horizontally within the lock walls with water leakage occurring from the cracks.</p>
<p>Required work requirements as part of the crack stabilization will include:</p>
<p>1. Installation of steel stressing high capacity rock/concrete anchors within the lock wall with the following specifications,</p>
<p>a. The anchors will be around 20 to 22 feet long to prevent the anchor hole from penetrating past the back side of the lock wall which will be of upmost importance that the penetration does not occur. The nominal lock wall concrete width is 24 feet.</p>
<p>b. The anchors will be required to be installed horizontally through the width of the lock wall at multiple horizontal planes within the lock walls. Approximately 45 ASTM A722 galvanized 1.25-inch diameter high capacity anchors are required with an expandable mechanical wedge on one end of the anchor and a bearing plate for seating the anchor stressing loads onto the concrete lock wall.</p>
<p>c. Holes for the high capacity anchors will be required to be core drilled on a near horizontal arrangement from the vertical lock wall face within the land lock chamber. It is the Contractor's responsibility to determine the equipment, means and methods to best drill holes. It is anticipated the holes will be drilled off a temporary floating barge platform with floating plant, fixed or elevated platform or other methods that will achieve the approximate 2.5-inch hole diameter and horizontal alignment for the anchor.</p>
<p>d. The anchor heads with the bearing plate will be required to be recessed within in a larger sized hole or recess opening at a nominal depth within the vertical lock wall. This recess will be filled with grout to protect and encapsulate anchor head.</p>
<p>e. The anchors will be stressed at two different intervals and each of the anchor groups will be stressed according to a specified sequence pattern to provide to an initial stress and final lock off stress for each anchor. Stressing and grouting of the high capacity anchor could be done using a floating plant or another means for the Contractor to determine.</p>
<p>2. Scheduling of the anchor installation.</p>
<p>a. The anchor installation must occur during specified multiple temporary lock closures in order to minimize the time the land lock chamber is closed. The Contractor must develop a detailed schedule to perform the work in a timely manner during these multiple temporary closures. It is anticipated the work must occur within a maximum 12-hour temporary daily lock closure period and within the planned Government maintenance 16-hour daily shutdown period scheduled to occur simultaneously over a part of the contract period of performance. Daily equipment set-ups and removals will be required as part of the contract work. A floating plant mooring area will be provided to the Contractor for performance of the contract work.</p>
<p>3. After the completion of the anchor installations, the existing cracks will be required to be pressure grouted to seal the water leakage. This pressure grouting will be performed from inside the existing gallery opening containing the lock service utilities and from vertical wall recesses opening using specialized grouting equipment. This will require the Contractor to select the appropriate grouting methods, pressures and techniques to successfully seal the cracks. The required pressure grouting will need to seal vertical and horizontal cracks within the concrete. Depending on the results of the initial grouting program, a secondary grouting of the cracks may be required.</p>
<p>4. The contract will require the installation of an instrumentation program to monitor, record and track the existing cracks within the lock wall during all period of the construction period. A qualified instrumentation monitoring individual shall be required as part of the contract.</p>
<p>Construction work will occur in close proximity to commercial navigation and recreation traffic which will require close coordination of the construction activities with the Lockmaster at the facility. The locks are staffed and operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also, although the Government efforts will not directly impact the Contractor's work, the work will require close coordination with other Government Contractors and the Government repair fleet that will be working on other features at the facility and utilization of the land chamber for temporary closures.</p>
<p>Disposal of excavated materials, concrete rubble and other construction waste material will be at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br /><br />This procurement will be advertised on an Unrestricted basis. The resulting award will be for one (1) Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. All responsible offerors are encouraged to participate. The work shall be completed 540 calendar days after written Notice to Proceed.

<SOLNBR>W912EF18B0019
<CONTACT>Julie Morris, Phone 5095277227, Email Julie.M.Morris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Construction project entitled: Waitsburg Levee Rehabilitation.  The construction will occur on the Waitsburg Levee in Waitsburg, WA.  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $36,500,000.  Solicitation is open to women-owned small business concerns.
<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The Waitsburg Levee system is on the left-bank of the Touchet River in Waitsburg, Washington.  The rehabilitation site is at the upstream end of the levee system, where it ties into high ground.</p>
<p>The work will require traffic control on Highway 12.  It is anticipated that dump trucks will need to turn onto the levee on the downstream side of the highway, and back across both lanes of the highway to back up along the levee to the worksite, which is approximately 800 feet upstream from the Highway 12 Bridge.  The needed traffic control requires permits from both the State and the City.</p>
<p>Excavations will be needed where the levee ties to high ground.  Approximately 30% of the levee cross section will be excavated in a localized area to make room for a riprap buttress fill.  After excavations are complete, large riprap stone can be imported and placed to construct the buttress fill, reconstruct a new riverside levee slope at the end of the levee, and repair the slope armor along the levee extending downstream.</p>
<p>Limited levee crown repairs will be completed to repair the expected rutting and shoving that will be caused by the construction equipment traffic.  The estimated period of performance is July 2018 - September 2018.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance.  In addition, the contractor will be required to develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>
<p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) employed by the prime contractor shall be required for each shift of the contractor's on-site operations.  The SSHO shall possess a minimum of 5-years' experience in construction safety on similar projects, shall have completed the 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety training within the last 5-years, and shall have completed at least 24-hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5-years.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period.  QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network.  The Government will make the QCS software available to the contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of contractor furnished submittals for items such as pre-construction plans, product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous work within the project includes the delivery of As-Built Drawings and Operations &amp; Maintenance manuals to the customer.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number W912EF-18-B-0019 will be posted to the FBO.gov in approximately 2-3 weeks. The solicitation is an Invitation for Bid.  Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.  Important Note: The FedBizOpps Response Date listed elsewhere in this synopsis is for FedBizOpps archive purposes only.  It does not necessarily reflect the actual proposal closing date.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)<br />Solicitation #FA8601-18-Q-0086-SS
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contacting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including other than small business, small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone) small businesses that are capable of providing a Bomb Calorimeter as defined in the attached Statement of Work - Bomb Calorimeter Purchase. Firms that respond shall specify their product(s) and requirements meet the specifications provided in the attachment below and provide detailed information to show clear technical compliance. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Note that the NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM.</p>
<p>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</p>
<p>1. Statement of Work - Bomb Calorimeter Purchase</p>
<p><br />All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334519 (Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing) with a small business size limit of 500 employees; the FSC for this acquisition is 6685. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and indicate socio-economic status (SB, SDB, WOSB, EDWOSB, 8(a), SDVOSB, VOSB, or HUBZONE SB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Please provide rationale as to how compliance with these limitations would be achieved, including details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or other than small businesses will be used. Also note that the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size under the Limitations of Subcontracting, as does the Non-Manufacturer Rule if a supply NAICS code is chosen. Respondents should consider how the primary tasks will be broken out between prime and subcontractors to avoid ostensible subcontracting, and address in the response if necessary.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition, a small business set aside (or other socio-economic set aside), or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the required commodities. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: stephen.ritter.5@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Bomb Calorimeter Purchase" If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xsls or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted. Responses may also be mailed to:</p>
<p>AFLCMC/PZIBB, <br />ATTN: POC- Stephen Ritter<br />1940 Allbrook Dr., Rm 109<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5344 Or electronically at stephen.ritter.5@us.af.mil</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSES ARE DUE NOT LATER THAN 18 APRIL 2018 BY 3:00 PM EST.</strong> Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Stephen Ritter at stephen.ritter.5@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine whether or not there are interested and available vendor sources capable of meeting the identified requirements. This document is for information and planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.<br /><br />
<p>The NASA GeneLab project is a Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA) effort to increase the utility and volume of omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, genomics) generated from biological spaceflight experiments. The GeneLab project will accomplish this in two ways. First, GeneLab will establish an open access repository of spaceflight relevant omics data to maximize its use by diverse investigators. Second, GeneLab will collaborate with projects and Principal Investigators (PI) to generate additional omics data from unused samples. Currently, GeneLab procures large amounts of sequencing services but has determined that it will be more efficient to generate this data with NASA owned and operated equipment. Therefore, GeneLab seeks to procure a high-throughput DNA sequencer to generate data to support its mission.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements - The DNA sequencer shall be capable of the following:</p>
<p>1) generating &gt;3 billion 100 bp single end reads or &gt;3 billion sets of 100 bp paired end reads in a single run; <br />2) producing data wherein &gt;80 % of the sequenced bases have a quality score of Phred 30 or greater.</p>
<p>Additional requirements: <br />&bull; Set-up DNA sequencer. Contractor will be required to set-up the DNA sequencer. This includes unboxing, start-up and performance of initial validation runs.<br />&bull; Providing training on use of DNA sequencer. Contractor will be required to provide training sufficient to run the sequencer. This must include classroom sessions as well as hands on training in which sequencing data is generated from sequencing libraries provided either by the contractor and/or by NASA<br />&bull; Provide support for DNA sequencer. Contractor will be required to provide technical and maintenance support lasting two years from set-up of the DNA sequencer. This support must include parts, labor and travel for any instrument failures, plus replacement of any sequencing reagents lost due to these failures.<br />&bull; Provide sequencing reagents. Contractor will be required to provide all reagents necessary for the sequencing of 450 samples with a read depth of 85 M 100 bp read pairs per sample (38.25 M read pairs total).<br />&bull; Provide library generation reagents. Contractor will be required to provide enough reagents for the creation of 450 indexed sequencing libraries. These reagents should allow the creation of RNA sequencing libraries starting with total RNA. These reagents should remove ribosomal RNA by ribosomal depletion. These reagents should retain strand information. These reagents should include 384 unique indexes.</p>
<p>The desired delivery time for the system is two weeks after award.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to acquire a commercial item and support services using the procedures identified in FAR Part 12. <br /><br />NASA ARC has identified the NovaSeq 6000 by Illumina, Inc. (5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA) as the only viable system capable of meeting the sequencer requirements and intends to negotiate a direct award under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>NASA is seeking capabilities from large and all categories of small businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI). Interested organizations having the necessary capabilities to meet the identified requirements may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact not later than the stated time. Submissions shall be made the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov). Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The requirements and procedures for offer submission are found in the FBO Vendor User Guide located on the FBO webpage at: https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>

<p><strong>Please see the Attached RFINIBIN2018 PDF. <br />All responses due Tuesday, April 17th no later than 5:00 PM EST to Daniel.Cordes@atf.gov</strong></p>
<p><strong>Below is a pasted version of the attachment; RFINIBIN2018 PFD.</strong></p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />Added: March 2018<br />The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is seeking to revise, modernize and improve the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). NIBIN today links over 175 local and state law enforcement agencies, allowing these agencies to solve crimes by comparing ballistics data within their regions or nationally in order to generate matches and link criminal investigative cases by the firearms used. ATF is seeking a vendor that can provide an innovative and cost-effective approach to capturing and comparing ballistics images. ATF is interested in a web-based system or networked system with high redundancy and fault tolerance. The system should be capable of acquiring the topographical features of fired ammunition components, comparing the images in order to generate matches, allowing manual entry of firearms data and case data and of reporting, data visualization and data mining capabilities. The preference is also to be able to use plug and play imaging equipment that is interoperable with any government-furnished workstations and servers.</p>
<p>Government selected contractors should be able to install and service both the equipment and the software.<br />This modernized version of NIBIN may also eventually be able to be incorporated into ATF's Service Oriented Architecture.<br />Ideally, the intellectual property would be developed for and owned by ATF.</p>
<p>Responses can cover all or parts of this request.</p>
<p>Preferences for Hardware and Software Architecture:<br />1. Enterprise-wide design; service oriented architecture</p>
<p>2. Plug and Play Imaging equipment that can capture ballistics images in a standard format and could be used with any existing GFE workstations/laptops and servers.</p>
<p>3. Portability, scalability</p>
<p>4. Central data repository with redundancy, automatic failover and fault-tolerance</p>
<p>5. Rapid data exchange and data synchronization between devices/computers</p>
<p>6. Smart client functionality<br />7. Ability for server deployment to FedRAMP certified government cloud environment</p>
<p>8. Use of virtualized servers and clients. Virtualized clients will be capable of running on Government furnished computers.</p>
<p>9. Sufficient memory for storing captured images</p>
<p>10. Solution should be a Certified Off the Shelf (COTS) product</p>
<p>11. Systems must come with a maintenance plan to include on-site and remote access log in.</p>
<p>12. Maintenance plans should include minimum/maximum down time schedules.</p>
<p>The application software should have minimum functionality as follows:<br />Collection/Input of images of cartridges and/or bullets:</p>
<p>1. A calibration/alignment method and camera equipment for collection of cartridge casing and or bullet images</p>
<p>2. Automation of image capture so that the captured images are uniform and standard</p>
<p>3. Manual entry of associated case information</p>
<p>4. Manual entry of firearms information</p>
<p>5. Ability to associate multiple images with a case<br />6. Cases can be modified, deleted, added</p>
<p>7. Each image is capable of being compared to other images</p>
<p>8. Automatic synchronization with server</p>
<p>9. Manual synchronization with server at user <br />request</p>
<p>10. System must be capable of multitasking</p>
<p>11. User friendly and icon driven</p>
<p>12. Dual stage microscope for acquisition of cartridge cases and/or bullets</p>
<p>13. 3D image capture</p>
<p>14. Ability to capture and compare multiple regions of interest on cartridge cases including breechface, firing pin, ejector mark</p>
<p>Comparison of Images to generate matches between images:</p>
<p>1. Request for top number of matches returned to user should be user configured</p>
<p>2. Comparison automatically occurs after all image and case data entry are completed</p>
<p>3. Configurable to automatically return results to one or more users</p>
<p>4. Can also be done upon manual user request for matches</p>
<p>5. Can be done between ATF specified "law enforcement regions" or nationally<br />6. Results should typically be returned within two hours.</p>
<p>7. Results provides list of matches and images so user can "view" and do their own visual comparison.<br />8. Must have a multi-viewer function for review process</p>
<p>9. Must be capable of adding memory when needed</p>
<p>10. Images must be compatible with current data bases</p>
<p>Reporting and analysis capability</p>
<p>1. Image analysis can be done with many different methods of visual comparison or data mining.</p>
<p>2. Reporting by regions or nationally</p>
<p>3. Multiple images can be compared/viewed side by side or other ways<br /><br />4. Various ad hoc or custom reports can be generated from the data</p>
<p>5. Reports can be printed, images can be printed</p>

VA Privacy Training for Personnel without Access to VA Computer Systems 
or Direct Access or Use to VA Sensitive Information



The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA must comply with all applicable privacy and confidentiality statutes and regulations.  One of the requirements in VA is to have all personnel trained annually on privacy requirements.   Privacy  represents what must be protected by VA in the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information whether the medium is electronic, paper or verbal.

This document satisfies the  basic  privacy training requirement for a contractor, volunteer, or other personnel only if the individual does not use or have access to any VA computer system such as Time and Attendance, PAID, CPRS, VistA Web,  VA sensitive information or protected health information (PHI), whether paper or electronic.  You will find this training outlines your roles and responsibility for protecting VA sensitive information (medical, financial, or educational) that you may incidentally or accidentally see or overhear. 

If you have direct access to protected health information or access to a VA computer system where there is protected health information such as CPRS, VistA Web, you must take  Privacy and HIPAA Focused Training  (TMS 10203).   VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior  (TMS 10176) is always required in order to use or gain access to a VA computer systems or VA sensitive information, whether or not protected health information is included.  Both trainings are located within the VA Talent Management System (TMS):  https://www.tms.va.gov

What is VA Sensitive Information/Data?
All Department information and/or data on any storage media or in any form or format, which requires protection due to the risk of harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information. The term includes not only information that identifies an individual but also other information whose improper use or disclosure could adversely affect the ability of an agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, and records about individuals requiring protection under applicable confidentiality provisions.

What is Protected Health Information? 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines protected health information as Individually Identifiable Health Information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity, such as VHA.  
What is an  Incidental  Disclosure?
An incidental disclosure is one where an individual s information may be disclosed incidentally even though appropriate safeguards are in place. Due to the nature of VA communications and practices, as well as the various environments in which Veterans receive healthcare or other services from VA, the potential exists for a Veteran s protected health information or VA sensitive information to be disclosed incidentally.  
For example:
You overhear a healthcare provider s conversation with another provider or patient even when the conversation is taken place appropriately. 
You may see limited Veteran information on sign-in sheets or white boards within a treating area of the facility.
Hearing a Veteran s name being called out for an appointment or when the Veteran is being transported/escorted to and from an appointment.

Safeguards You Must Follow To Secure VA Sensitive Information:
Secure any VA sensitive information found in unsecured public areas (parking lot, trash can, or vacated area) until information can be given to your supervisor or Privacy Officer.  You must report such incidents to your Privacy Officer timely.
Don t take VA sensitive information off facilities grounds without VA permission unless the VA information is general public information, i.e., brochures/pamphlets.
Don t take pictures using a personal camera without the permission from the Medical Center Director. 
Any protected health information overheard or seen in VA should not be discussed or shared with anyone who does not have a need to know the information in the performance of their official job duties, this includes spouses, employers or colleagues. 
Do not share VA access cards, keys, or codes to enter the facility. 
Immediately report lost or stolen Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHIC), any VA keys or keypad lock codes to your supervisor or VA police. 
Do not use a VA computer using another VA employee s access and password. 
Do not ask another VA employee to access your own protected health information.  You must request this information in writing from the Release of Information section at your facility.

What are the Six Privacy Laws and Statutes Governing VA?
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) compels disclosure of reasonably described VA records or a reasonably segregated portion of the records to any person upon written request unless one or more of the nine exemptions apply.
Privacy Act of 1974 provides for the confidentiality of personal information about a living individual who is a United States citizen or an alien lawfully admitted to U.S. and whose information is retrieved by the individual s name or other unique identifier, e.g. Social Security Number.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides for the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of health care systems by encouraging the development of health information systems through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission, privacy, and security of certain health information. 
38 U.S.C. 5701 provides for the confidentiality of all VA patient and claimant information, with special protection for their names and home addresses.
38 U.S.C. 7332 provides for the confidentiality of drug abuse, alcoholism and alcohol abuse, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sickle cell anemia medical records and health information.
38 U.S.C. 5705 provides for the confidentiality of designated medical-quality assurance documents.

What are the Privacy Rules Concerning Use and Disclosure? 
You are not authorized to use or disclose protected health information.  In general, VHA personnel may only use information for purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations when they have a need-to-know in the course of their official job duties.  VHA may only disclose protected health information upon written request by the individual who is the subject of the information or as authorized by law. 

How is Privacy Enforced? 
There are both civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties that may be imposed if a privacy violation has taken place.  Any willful negligent or intentional violation of an individual s privacy by VA personnel, contract staff, volunteers, or others may result in such corrective action as deemed appropriate by VA including the potential loss of employment, contract, or volunteer status. 

Know your VA/VHA Privacy Officer and Information Security Officer.  These are the individuals to whom you can report any potential violation of protected health information or VA sensitive information, or any other concerns regarding privacy of VA sensitive information.  


YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF OUR VETERANS

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) and Sources Sought is for Planning Purposes Only
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a quote.<br /><br />This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain services, at reasonable cost and price, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award. <br /><br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information, on behalf of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Maintenance of the North Atlantic Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalog Services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 541715, with a size standard of 1000 Employees. This RFI/Sources Sought will be used solely for market research and does not constitute a solicitation.<br /><br />Scope<br /><br />The management of North Atlantic right whales has been a topic of concern for several years. The need for an ability to manage and archive information and provide it in a timely manner continues to be extremely important. The Contractor shall manage and maintain all aspects of the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog. This includes: Maintaining and curating the photo-identification Catalog; maintaining to the right whale scarring database; continued reporting of Anthropogenic Injury Case Studies; continued near real-time matching for biopsy efforts, entangled, injured, sick or dead right whales; maintaining the genetic / catalog database comparison, including correcting and matching as necessary; and maintaining the health assessment database.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />NEFSC is one of several agencies that have responsibilities and informational needs related to implementation of the right whale recovery plan. In 1992, NMFS released the Final Recovery Plan for the Northern Right Whale and convened a workshop on the science and management of the right whale in the western North Atlantic. The workshop proceedings document included specific prioritized recommendations for the implementation of the recovery plan. Within the actions identified, the photo-identification catalog was identified as an essential infrastructure element. In 1994, an external review of NEFSC-supported right whale research reiterated the recommendation of high priority for continuation of the photo-identification catalog. A series of workshops on right whales sponsored by the International Whaling Commission and/or NMFS in 1998, 1999, and 2000 recommended various research tasks and analyses for which the photo-identification Catalog has been a critical resource, in addition to simply maintaining the catalog itself as a critical component of the research infrastructure. In May of 2005, NMFS published Recovery Plan for the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis), Revision. One specified recovery task singles out the catalog as a priority item, and a substantial number of other recovery tasks depends on the database for success, including one specifically identifying the scarring database. At the time of the MMC panel review (2006), catalog management included linking photo-identifications to biopsies and health assessments; and "the provision of real-time data on individual whale identities for researchers engaged in biopsy darting or tagging; information on identity and health assessment of stranded, injured, or entangled right whales; and responses to requests for data to be used in many types of scientific and management analyses" as well as photo-identification matching.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic right whale catalog is the premier example, internationally, of a catalog of photographically identified large whales. It currently includes over 200,000 photographs dating back to 1935, and approximately 300 institutions and individuals have contributed to the Catalog. Almost every individual member of the species of North Atlantic right whale is identified, and has a substantial sighting history. The Catalog's data sharing protocols are exemplars used by other catalogs, and data from the Catalog are used by multiple organizations. The Catalog remains the primary data source used for NMFS' management of anthropogenic impacts on North Atlantic right whales. The current catalog is currently maintained by the Right Whale Research Project of the New England Aquarium in Boston.<br /><br />The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>The Government requests capability statements from all businesses who qualify under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology), which has a corresponding business size standard of 1,000 Employees. Company size status for the NAICS Code stated above (small business concern per 13 CFR, educational institution, federal, local or state entity, commercial entity, nonprofit organization, etc.); and socio-economic status for NAICS Code stated above (8(a), hubzone, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled/veteran owned, women owned, etc.). The interested Contractor response should include how the Contractor could furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to provide the services as provided in Attached Draft Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Note: This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this notice will not be returned. In submitting a response, you are solely responsible and accountable for all of the expenses associated with your response.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RIX Industries designed the LPAP. RIX Industries owns all of the manufacturing drawings and software for this equipment. The Government does not have, nor does it possess the legal right to, the prerequisite technical data essential to the manufacturing of the MARC 350A LPAPs, or to obtain this material on the basis of full and open competition. All of the detailed design information, which includes manufacturing, procedures and methods, was developed by RIX Industries. RIX Industries has unique knowledge and experience to support the manufacturing, installation troubleshooting, repairs, and unit redesigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSWCPD intends to issue modifications to the specified vendor via the base contract N64498-17-D-0011 and to Delivery Order N6449817F4105 to meet mission requirements.

The cover page is not considered in the total page count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSWCPD will accept only electronic unclassified submission of responses. Responses shall be sent to Stephen Green at stephen.f.green@navy.mil with the subject line "RFI MARC 350A LPAP Procurement." All responses shall be unclassified and submitted by no later than 5:00 pm Eastern on 17 April 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This RFI is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This RFI Notice is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI, and the Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the response to this RFI.
