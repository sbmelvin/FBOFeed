<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to extend its Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) Facilities Development and Operations Contract (FDOC) NNJ09HD46C for a period of 2-years with an additional one year option.  The current FDOC period of performance ends on September 30, 2014. FDOC provides mission systems services for Mission Control and Training Systems in support of NASA programmatic elements such as, but not limited to, the International Space Station (ISS) Program and Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV).  It consolidates efforts across the mission operations support facilities (Mission Control Center System, Training System, Operations Technology, and User Applications) in order to maximize synergy for hardware and software development, modification, sustaining, maintenance, reconfiguration, and operations.	 NASA/JSC, under the current FDOC, has undertaken three major critical facility upgrade projects (Mission Control Center 21, Training Systems 21, and User Applications 21) to achieve long term cost savings.  A fundamental redesign of the legacy systems was required which resulted in new hardware and software systems being implemented on a highly aggressive and accelerated schedule given the nature and scope of these development projects.  The FDOC contractor is on an accelerated schedule to complete the development of the core systems with the transition to operations commencing Q3FY14. Transition and operations of these new and immature systems requires inherent knowledge to ensure availability of essential data and mission services in support of the ISS Program.  This is especially true when the operations and sustaining support profiles have targeted reductions as a result of the new hardware and software system implementations; requiring continuity of core knowledge of the new systems, their designs, and the rationale of the designs, to afford timely resolutions of failures. Transitioning the contract at this critical phase poses a major technical risk to the systems and Program.  As the incumbent contractor, NASA/JSC intends to acquire these services from Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions (LMIS&GS).  Transition and operations of these new and immature systems requires that LMIS&GS complete delivery and bring to operational maturity the three major critical facility upgrade projects (Mission Control Center 21, Training Systems 21, and User Applications 21).  It is essential that LMIS&GS mature these new systems through a transition to successful operations to ensure future availability of essential data and mission services and maintain uninterrupted support to the International Space Station (ISS) Program.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Jannette Bolden @ jannette.r.bolden@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on July 23, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The installation Ombudsman is Perri Fox and can be reached at perri.e.fox@nasa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for LN2 Manifold, GN2 Enclosures and required Installation and Safety Accessories. NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Hastings' Chariot. NASA LaRC currently owns a LN2 manifold distribution system designed and built by Hastings' Chariot. A second identical system is required to minimize condensation while maximizing maintenance simplicity. The LN2 manifold system is required to be identical and compatible to the existing LN2 manifold and significant interfacing hardware NASA has already invested in to maintain commonality, in order to have predictable operational consistency. It would take substantial duplication of recources and time for another source to provide the required manifold system, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 07/15/2013.

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive RM 1E142, Rockville, MD 20892.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure 10 grams of OXO 63 paramagnetic tracer on a sole source basis with GE Healthcare, 3200 N. Grandview Blvd., Mail Code WT-897, Waukesha, WI 53188.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 325998 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made within two (2) months of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Biophysics Spectroscopy Branch in the Radiation Biology Branch (RBB) is currently developing new imaging modalities to study physiological responses of tumors and normal tissues to radiation and chemotherapy drugs. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging (EPRI) is a technology which has been under development by RBB and is now a routinely used method in pre-clinical studies in mouse models of human cancer to screen drugs and serially follow tumor response to treatment. EPRI is a magnetic resonance imaging technique which utilizes injecting a paramagnetic tracer in the experimental animals and conducting imaging experiments to generate maps of tissue oxygen. Since imaging experiments need the tracer for these studies, the tracer needs to be non-toxic and remain in circulation for the duration of the imaging times. The paramagnetic tracer Oxo 63 ((tris[8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetrakis (2-hydroxymethyl)benzoyl[1,2-d']bis(1,3)dithio-4-yl]methyl radical) is a tracer the NCI has been using in all of NCI's small animal imaging studies. Acquiring this material ensures continuity in NCI's experimental research.</p>
<p>The NCI is in need of 10 grams of Oxo63 material for in vivo EPR Imaging studies in mouse models of human cancer to evaluate tumor physiology and its response to treatment using radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Tissues imaged using the above imaging techniques will be further studied using immunochemistry techniques to identify which molecular pathways are active and responsible for In vivo signatures.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor, GE Healthcare, is the only manufacturer capable of manufacturing this material at the quantity and quality needed for NCI studies. This compound is a patented product and available solely from GE Healthcare. Thus, GE Healthcare is the only known source to manufacture the material needed to accomplish the NCI's mission.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00AM EST on 07/23/2013. All responses questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240)276-5401 or emailed to Afua Serwah- Asibey, Contract Specialist at afua.serwah-asibey@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), through sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NO2RC32512-59 on all correspondence.</p>

The final RFP is expected to be issued by December 2013.
  NAVSEA will not be conducting an Industry Day session prior to the release of the final Request for Proposal (RFP); therefore, NAVSEA is requesting that industry provide feedback on the ability to meet the key requirements and schedules as defined in this Request for Information (RFI).  

A Competition Library containing Government Furnished Information (GFI) has been established by PEO IWS 1.0.  CD-ROMs are available to eligible parties to review prior to the issuance of a solicitation.

The Government will accept questions requesting clarification of the documents contained in the Competition Library and attached to this posting.  Interested parties are requested to provide responses and submit questions or comments NLT 9 August 2013.  Additionally, interested parties are requested to consider the following items and provide responses via email to the Contract Specialists:

1.	Schedule  The schedule is driven by the need to have fully environmentally qualified 1st production units by August 2016.  The Government is requesting feedback on the ability of industry to meet this key date given the constraints contained in the draft Statement of Work. 
2.	Technical Feasibility  The key requirements in the System Requirements Documents and Critical Item Development Specifications are the use of innovative touch panel technology, the need for reliable systems to reduce maintenance, and the usability requirements driven by the US Navy Sailors.
  The Government is requesting industry feedback on the ability to meet all of these requirements in a single solution. 

Only questions transmitted electronically to NAVSEA Contracts shall receive a response.  Responses will be posted to this solicitation notice on FedBizOpps.

However, individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under this Navy Weapons System. A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact. 

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of contracts. Grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions may also be awarded if appropriate. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit a White Paper (WP), to include in a separate volume, a rough cost estimate to nrlproposals@nrl.navy.mil . Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit White Papers as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA topic. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, award considerations, and evaluation criteria is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa/index03.html . <br />Specific research topics of interest include: <br />53-13-01 HIGH FREQUENCY RADAR <br />53-13-01C HIGH FREQUENCY RADAR (CLASSIFIED) <br />53-13-02 LOW COST WIDEBAND ANTENNA ARRAY TECHNOLOGY <br />53-13-03 ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS <br />55-13-01 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND DECISION ARCHITECTURES*REVISED* <br />55-13-02 MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF HIGH ASSURANCE COMPUTING <br />55-13-03 HIGH ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING <br />55-13-04 ADVANCED NAVAL NETWORK SOLUTIONS <br />55-13-05 ADVERSARIAL MODELING AND DECISION SUPPORT <br />55-13-06 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR HIGH ASSURANCE COMPUTER SYSTEMS <br />56-13-01 VIS-IR GLASS WINDOWS AND HEAVY METAL OXIDE GLASSES <br />56-13-02 LOW LOSS, NEAR AND MID-IR TRANSMITTING FIBERS <br />56-13-03 LASER THREAT COUNTERMEASURE TECHNOLOGY <br />56-13-04 IMAGING SEEKER ADVANCED COUNTERMEASURES <br />56-13-05 OPTICAL SCIENCES R&amp;D <br />56-13-06 INFRARED FIBER OPTIC CABLES AND COMPONENTS <br />56-13-07 ACTIVE DEVICES <br />57-13-01 INNOVATIVE ANTI-SHIP MISSILE - ELECTRONIC WARFARE SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY <br />57-13-02 ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT <br />57-13-03 OFFBOARD COUNTERMEASURES <br />57-13-04 AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC WARFARE <br />61-13-01 POWER/ENERGY SOURCE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS *REVISED* <br />61-13-02 CORROSION PROCESSES, CONTROL, MITIGATION, AND TECHNOLOGY <br />61-13-03 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSENSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS FOR PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOCHEMICAL APPLICATIONS <br />61-13-04 APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND ADVANCED LASER TECHNIQUES <br />63-13-01 MATERIALS PERFORMANCE, PROCESSING AND MODELING <br />64-13-01 HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ON MASSIVELY PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES <br />67-13-01 BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASMAS <br />68-13-01 RF VACUUM ELECTRONICS <br />68-13-02 RADIATION EFFECTS RESEARCH <br />68-13-03 PHOTOVOLTAICS FOR PORTABLE POWER <br />69-13-01 RESEARCH IN BIO-MOLECULAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING <br />71-13-01 ACOUSTIC SIMULATION, MEASUREMENTS AND TACTICS <br />72-13-01 LOW FREQUENCY RADIO INTERFEROMETRY <br />72-13-02 OPTICAL REMOTE SENSING OF THE COASTAL REGIME*REVISED* <br />72-13-03 REMOTE SENSORS AND IMAGING SYSTEMS <br />73-13-01 OCEAN DYNAMICS AND PREDICTION OCEANOGRAPHY <br />75-13-01 ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS, ANALYSIS, AND PREDICTION <br />74-13-01 AIRBORNE AND SHIPBOARD DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS <br />74-13-02 SEAFLOOR SCIENCES <br />74-13-03 GEOSPATIAL SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY <br />76-13-01 RESEARCH INTO SPACE - ITS IMAGING AND MODELING *REVISED* <br />82-13-01 SPACE AND SPACE SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY</p>

<DESC><p>The work consists of&nbsp;removal of pinnacle and shelf rock within the Middle Mississippi River navigation channel. A series of rock outcrops totaling approximately 6,700 cubic yards needs to be removed to meet authorized project width and depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement is solicited as an unrestricted competitive procurement. The locations and material type is listed below:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Wittenberg/Grand Tower: River mile 82.0 to 79.0. Bedrock at the upstream point near Wittenberg lies within a fault zone and is probably composed of hard sandstones and limestone. Interpretation of geophysical soundings indicates that high bedrock is in the form of a large mound or pinnacle and is probably limestone. Downstream of Tower Rock at Grand Tower, bedrock is composed of thinly bedded chert and hard, dense limestone. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this downstream location indicates bedrock is in the form of a shelf extending completely across the channel. <br /><br />Gray's Point: River mile 46.0 to 45.0. The bedrock present at this site is a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates a large bedrock promontory and some large pinnacles present on the Illinois side.<br />Thebes Bridge Area: River mile 45 to 42.8. The bedrock present along this site is a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates the presence of numerous pinnacles. <br /><br />Counterfeit Rock: River mile 42.8 to 39.7. Bedrock at this site lies within a fault zone which offsets various limestone and sandstones within a short distance. From approximately river mile 42.8to 42.0, the bedrock is composed of a hard, dense, medium bedded limestone which typically erodes into a pinnacled, irregular surface. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates the presence of small, isolated pinnacles. Downstream of this area, bedrock is composed of both a cherty limestone, which typically erodes into pinnacles and hard sandstone which typically forms ledges. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this downstream location indicates the presence of a rock shelf extending beneath the river channel with localized pinnacles upon it. <br /><br />Commerce: River mile 39.7 to 38.0. The bedrock at this site is composed of thinly bedded and poorly consolidated sandstone lenses with unconsolidated sands and clays, hard dense sandstone, and alimonitic pebble conglomerate. Approximately 30 percent of the rock in this area was able to be removed by drag-line in rock excavation performed in 1984. The interpretation of geophysical soundings at this location indicates large, isolated pinnacles.<br /><br />&nbsp;The estimated cost range of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990. The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation package will be issued on or about November 20, 2012.

<a href="mailto:Colleen.donahue-macdonald@va.gov">Colleen Donahue-MacDonald</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Eastern Kansas Health Care System (VAEKHC) intends to solicit proposals from contractors to provide services as part of its Safe Haven Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VAEKHCS is made up of two (2) Medical Centers, the Colmery O'Neil VA Medical Center, 2200 SW Gage Blvd., Topeka, Kansas and the Dwight D. Eisenhower VA Medical Center, 4101 South 4th Street Trafficway, Leavenworth, Kansas.  Target facility for this contract should be located within a 15 mile radius of either facility.

The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about July 29, 2013, with a closing date for proposals on or about August 19, 2013.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the Safe Haven HCHV program is to end homelessness amongst the VAEKHCS Veteran population by enhancing current homeless service capacity.  The intent of this contract is to engage a community provider to offer homeless Veterans services through a "Safe Haven" specialty model of residential care.  In compliance with this model, services will be provided 24/7 to chronically homeless Veteran(s), and training will be provided to the Contractor by the VA National Center on Homelessness among Veterans for program development.  Evaluation protocol and program fidelity measures developed by the VA National Center must be adhered to by the selected Contractor.  This contract is expected to house and serve up to 20 chronically homeless male and female Veterans in need of immediate placement in a safe environment with onsite supportive services.  Stabilization of these Veterans suffering from co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and complex needs utilizing the specialty model is seen as a critical step toward ending homelessness.  
A Safe Haven is a form of supportive housing that serves hard-to-reach homeless persons with severe mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders who are currently living on the streets and/or have been unable or unwilling to participate in more traditional supportive services.  It is a "low demand" model of service delivery that allows clients to engage in treatment and services at their own pace. The community-based treatment facility should offer a safe and secure environment that supports Veteran rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

NAICS Code is 623220 with a small business size standard of $14M.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, Required Central Contractor Registration and in accordance with FAR 2.101, Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 802.101, VetBiz Registration, prospective contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain CCR information under the System for Awards Management (www.sam.gov) and Vet Biz information at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov .  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) data base at www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to grace.windler@va.gov and ensure that the subject line includes: VA-255-13-R-0892.

Awards to responsive and responsible offerors will be made on the basis of best value to the Government using the following criteria:

"	Staffing Capability.
"	Assessment to provide community interaction, encourage independence, and provide transportation.
"	Ability to provide individual case management and group interventions.
"	Ability to provide a safe environment consistent with the Safe Haven Model
"	Registration in SAM.
"	Distance of contract facility from designated VA Medical Centers.
"	Number of available beds (male and female).
"	Current state license or certification.
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA exclusion review (fire safety, general safety, and compliance review conducted by VA personnel) prior to award

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities and the needs of the veterans.  Because it is impossible to determine actual delivery or quantify need for any day, the VA uses Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts with a guaranteed minimum of 1 veteran bed day of care for 30 days.

This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). All SDVOSB offerors must be verified by the Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) at www.vetbiz.gov and be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). Interested parties should also register as such on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.

This will be accomplished by adding new panel boxes, circuits, conduit, transformer and rewiring existing panel boxes. The contractor will mark up the panel schedules and drawings to indicate the as-built conditions of the work performed under this scope of work and provide in an AutoCAD 2010 drawing.

<p>The Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support supplies the military Services with nerve agent antidotes during peacetime and wartime. This is a Request for Information (RFI) on current manufacturing capabilities and new technology development for nerve agent antidotes in auto-injectors that might be used in wartime in response to chemical attacks. They could also be used in peacetime.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>*** OBJECTIVE ***</p>
<p>The nerve agent antidote auto-injectors, hereinafter referred to as auto-injectors, are pressure activated devices suitable for intramuscular administration. The unit will contain active drug ingredients (e.g. atropine, pralidoxime, diazepam, etc.) for the purpose of countering the effects of nerve agent poisoning.</p>
<p>In wartime, the need for auto-injectors may increase significantly. To meet an increased demand, the existing supply and baseline production capacity of auto-injector devices in the U.S. may need to expand. DLA Troop Support is requesting information on existing and planned manufacturing capabilities for auto-injectors.</p>
<p>***CURRENTLY MARKETED DEVICES***</p>
<p>If your firm currently markets an auto-injector device, please provide information with respect to the following:</p>
<p>a) Place of manufacture<br />b) Estimated annual capacity<br />c) FDA registration (if applicable)<br />d) Product name and description including description of any special features<br />e) Current unit sale price<br />f) Estimated inventory level and storage requirements</p>
<p><br />*** NEW TECHNOLOGY/DEVICES UNDER DEVELOPMENT***</p>
<p>For products under development, describe the current stage of development and whether the product has undergone independent laboratory testing or FDA testing/trials etc.</p>
<p>Firms and organizations that currently develop or manufacture auto-injectors described in this RFI or that have technologies, devices or manufacturing capabilities under development are invited to submit information to DLA Troop Support. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DLA Troop Support in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate planning and procurement strategy for auto-injectors. All information submitted will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002.</p>
<p>Your response to this RFI may be submitted electronically in pdf format and emailed to neil.mcavinue@dla.mil</p>

To be objective and fair in determining contract awards, we ask that you participate in our Service Contract Performance Monitoring Program by filling out this report on a quarterly basis. Completed reports should be returned to the Contracting Office by the end of the second week of the month following the end of the quarter. The completed reports can be sent hard copy or by email.  It is important that the form be completed by the designated COTR or an associate who is technically or professionally capable of rating the performance of the service being provided.

"Contract monitoring is only as effective as the diligence of the COTR and/or designee".  Please read the definitions of the ratings and rate appropriately.

<DESC><p>U.S. Office of Personnel Management<br />Leadership Training<br />Presidential Management Fellows Program</p>
<p>Request for Information<br />OPM2013I0001</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objective</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify vendor sponsored courses that will be listed on the Presidential Management Fellow's website. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation, which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program, was established by President Jimmy Carter by Executive Order 12008 in 1977 for the purpose of attracting to Federal service men and women of exceptional management potential who had received special training in planning and managing public programs and policies. Outstanding individuals pursuing advanced degrees are eligible to apply for participation in the two-year program. Through the years there have been additional Executive Orders that made changes to reflect the high standards, rigor, and prestige of this program.</p>
<p>The program is highly selective and competitive. In 2013, approximately 650 were selected as finalists out of an applicant pool of more than 10,000. After being deemed a finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal government department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the program, PMFs may be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>Because this is a program of the President of the United States and bears the President's seal, it is important that all aspects of the program reflect the stature of the Presidency. A critical part of the program is the Fellows, as future leaders in Federal government, understand leadership and related leadership competencies and build upon this knowledge to develop their own leadership skills and philosophy. The PMF program uses OPM's Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) as its standard for identifying leadership competencies for the Fellows.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this RFI is to identify vendors that provide courses developed for PMFs and have enrollment limited to PMFs and meet the criteria listed below. The PMF Program Office will publish on the PMF website links to vendor website for vendor course information. The RFI will not result in any contracted document between OPM and a vendor and will only provide a platform to post links to approved vendors' courses. OPM will not include vendor courses on its website before October 1, 2013.<br /><br />Capability Statement/Information Sought:</p>
<p>Interested businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience and/or ability to satisfy the minimum requirements listed below.<br />Capability Statement Requirements:<br />OPM is requesting information from vendors who provide training in developing leadership competencies as defined by the OPM ECQs. Vendors must have experience with Federal customers and a history of providing leadership training for Federal customers. Vendors must be willing to offer courses that limit attendance to PMFs.<br /><br />To be considered, vendors must submit the following information for each proposed course:</p>
<p>&bull; Course title<br />&bull; Target audience (please include if there is a specific group amongst the PMFs)<br />&bull; How vendor will limit attendance to PMFs<br />&bull; How course material is relevant for the PMF audience<br />&bull; Duration of course (must be at least 8 hours)<br />&bull; Location of the training<br />&bull; Approximate cost of course (must be within industry standards)<br />&bull; Approximate date(s) of course will be offered during FY14 (October 1, 2013 - September 30, 2014)<br />&bull; Vendor Website<br />&bull; Name, phone number and email address of point of contact<br />&bull; Resume(s)/Bio(s) of lead instructor(s)<br />&bull; Past performance and references from Federal customers <br />&bull; Delivery Mechanism (must be in-person training)<br />&bull; OPM Executive Core Qualifications addressed (e.g., Leading Change, Leading People, etc.)<br />&bull; Competencies addressed (e.g., Vision, Flexibility, Strategic Thinking, Team Building, Conflict Management, etc.)</p>
<p><br />&bull; Course design documents including<br />o Instructor manual<br />o Course agenda<br />o Learning objectives<br />o Content summary for each course module including instructional strategies used to meet established objectives<br />o Sample handouts/visual aids</p>
<p>Learning Objectives:</p>
<p>Vendors must submit learning objectives with stated outcomes for each course. All courses submitted must include a tie to OPM ECQs and related competencies taught in the course content. This RFI is limited to the leadership training based on OPM's ECQ's and related competencies.<br />Qualifying Factors:<br />Once course materials are received, PMF Program Office will review the course materials submitted for the following:<br />&bull; Curriculum that addresses ECQs and competencies<br />&bull; Relevancy of information to PMFs and challenges facing today's leaders<br />&bull; Coverage of learning objectives<br />&bull; Education and work history of instructor(s)<br />&bull; Past experience with Federal customers<br />&bull; Past course evaluations<br />Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan:<br />OPM will monitor training evaluation data from each course submitted to the PMF Program. Vendor should evaluate their course(s) at least at Kirkpatrick Level 1 and Level 2. OPM will collect course evaluation information data for all courses on the PMF website. OPM will ask for updates to vendor's training evaluation data on a periodic basis, but no less than every two years.</p>
<p>If the vendor drops below a score of 4 out of 5 (or the equivalent), the vendor must review the training evaluations and address the problems identified with the course. If the problems are not addressed, the course will be removed from the PMF website.</p>
<p>In addition, at the end of each training session, the vendor will provide each participant with the PMF training course evaluation form (to be found on the PMF website) to rate the course.</p>
<p>Vendors must keep their course content updated to provide training relevant to issues today's leaders face. OPM reserves the right to audit the course.</p>

If a solicitation is released, it will be issued via either the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) or eBuy (www.ebuy.gsa.gov) depending on the government's acquisition strategy. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these websites for any information that may pertain to this notice or a future solicitation.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines as well as licensing hydropower projects.</p>
<p>FERC is organized into eleven offices, one of which is the Office of Energy Projects (OEP). The mission of the Office of Energy Projects (OEP) is to foster economic and environmental benefits for the nation through certification of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, authorization of LNG facilities, authorization of certain electric transmission facilities located within corridors identified by the Department of Energy, and licensing and oversight of jurisdictional hydroelectric projects, as well as instituting policies and procedures that ensure the safety and reliability of current and future infrastructure.</p>
<p>Contractor Support</p>
<p>OEP contracts with the private sector for engineering and environmental services in support of OEP's mission. The current contract was awarded to Robert Bachman and D.J. Nyman &amp; Associates on January 14, 2009 and February 10, 2009, respectively. The contracts include one base year and four option years. The contracts are currently in the fourth option year and will expire on January 13, 2014 and February 9, 2014.</p>
<p>FERC intends to award the follow-on contract prior to the expiration of the current contract. As of the date of the release of this notice, the government has not finalized the acquisition strategy for this procurement; however, currently the government anticipates that the procurement will be a Firm Fixed Price contract or BPA with a base year and four option years, awarded on a competitive basis to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government. The Commission anticipates a single award but reserves the right to award multiple contracts or not to award a contract at all.</p>
<p>The current schedule for the follow-on acquisition is as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Release the Request for Proposals: September 2013<br />&bull; Proposals due: October 2013<br />&bull; Contract award: January 2014</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy and schedule is subject to change without notice based on information the government gains during the acquisition planning phase, including but not limited to information gained as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>Work description for follow-on contract</p>
<p>The statement of work (SOW) for the follow-on procurement has not been finalized; however, OEP anticipates that the contractor will be required to provide technical evaluation services on:</p>
<p>&bull; the structural/seismic design and storm/earthquake resistant construction of proposed onshore and marine LNG facilities filed before the FERC ; <br />&bull; post-authorization implementation of required seismic and storm resistant design measures.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide structural/geotechnical/earthquake/storm engineering evaluation services to the FERC on facility design and operation of various LNG projects proposed or authorized by the FERC to assure compliance with appropriate regulations, local standards and state-of-the-art procedures. Emphasis will be placed on the adequacy of the regional and site-specific seismicity and geologic studies, storm surge and tsunami evaluation, seismic design input values and their application, post-earthquake/tsunami/storm operation of the facilities, including the LNG containment requirements following a "safe-shutdown earthquake," and compliance with all applicable regulations.</p>
<p>Special Contract Requirements</p>
<p>The work under this contract requires that the contractor be given access to confidential or proprietary engineering design information belonging to the government or other companies. The contractor must be able to treat such information as confidential and agree not to appropriate such information to its own use or to disclose such information to third parties.</p>
<p>Sources sought / request for information</p>
<p>FERC is interested in hearing from sources within the market that have capabilities and experience similar to or of greater complexity to the work identified in work description above. The purpose of the request is to identify capable, experienced sources interested in the procurement, and to verify there is sufficient competition available in the market.</p>
<p>FERC requests that interested parties submit the following information:</p>
<p>Name and address of the company <br />Point of contact<br />Name<br />E-mail<br />Phone Number <br />Size and type of ownership <br />Anticipated North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this acquisition and your company's related small business size standard, if applicable. <br />Data Universal Numbering (DUNS) <br />System for Award Management (SAM) number <br />Federal Cage Code number <br />Marketing information describing the company's capability and experience similar to or of greater complexity to the work identified in the work description section of this notice <br />GSA Schedule contract number, if applicable</p>

<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>

<DESC><strong><em>This notice was previously released on May 1, 2013, under Solicitation No. HHS-NIH-NIAID(AI)-SBSS-13-172, with a due date of May 15, 2013 for receipt of all capability statements. However, this notice is being released again due to the fact that we now have updated information.<br /><br /></em>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong><br />Background<br /></strong>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) supports extramural research to study, control and prevent diseases caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, non-vaccine prevention modalities, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DAIDS also supports an array of research resources to assist investigators, including programs that provide or produce organisms, state-of-the-art reagents, and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndResources/resources/ATRG/Pages/default.aspx).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new therapeutics and topical microbicides against HIV remains a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID supports preclinical development of promising therapeutic and topical microbicide candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources.</p>
<p>These services are currently provided by two NIAID in vitro testing resources entitled, "In Vitro Testing Resources for AIDS Therapeutic Development - &lsquo;Part A: Confirmatory In Vitro Evaluations of HIV Therapeutics' (under Contract No. HHSN272200700041C with the Southern Research Institute) and &lsquo;Part B: Specialized In Vitro Biological Assays for HIV Therapeutics and Topical Microbicides' (under Contract No. HHSN272200700042C with the Southern Research Institute)". However, the Government intends to consolidate these services into one requirement under one contract.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide product development services utilizing biochemical and cell-based assays in both standard and high throughput screening (HTS) formats. These services have assisted a wide variety of investigators in obtaining critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), and fulfill regulatory agency requirements.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding one (1) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract to an organization able to provide the technical requirements of the solicitation and with documented access to BSL-2+ facilities (for the purposes of this solicitation, BSL-2+ is defined as BSL-2 facilities with BSL-3 practices).</p>

<CONTACT>Michael T. Fischer, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014430728, Email Michael.Fischer@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><br />BACKGROUND:
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Federal Occupational Health Service (FOH), provides occupational health services to other Federal agencies. FOH provides occupational health (OH) consultation, and stimulates the development of improved OH and safety programs throughout the Federal Government. FOH defines OH from the Federal Government perspective as "a comprehensive approach, with a public health perspective, to improving the health and safety of the Federal work force; thereby increasing their productivity, and decreasing the Government's liability and health care costs through various clinical, environmental, educational, and risk-based prevention programs." The FOH mission is to be the benchmark for Federal OH programs. <br /><br />FOH is the single largest provider of OH services in the Federal government, serving more than 360 Federal government agencies and departments and reaching more than 1.5 million Federal government employees. FOH provides these services to other Federal agencies under individual 100% reimbursable Interagency Agreements according to 42USC231 and the Service and Supply Fund Charter. Agreements are negotiated with Federal government departments' and agencies' national headquarters, and/or with their regional/local components. Some agreements contain a standard package of OH program components; others contain an array of services and consultations tailored to particular OH or environmental needs.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>FOH currently provides occupational health medical examinations to Federal employees at FOH Occupational Health Clinics. Not all clinics are fully equipped to provide all required cardiac testing for the medical examinations, and require the Federal employee to obtain the cardiac testing at other health care facilities. The purpose of this PWS is to obtain cardiac testing services for FOH client Federal employees, in order for FOH to deliver completed Occupational Health exams to our client government agencies in the Washington DC metro area.</p>
<p>Services Required:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the cardiac testing services and shall review all materials for completeness, adequacy of testing and accuracy of services through standard, as well as innovative, continuous quality improvement techniques. All testing and services shall meet the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Contractor shall be responsible for staying abreast of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that necessary training and instructions are given to all staff providing the cardiac testing services.</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS:<br />This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain, the CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division based out of Lynn, MA, USA. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft and its CT7-9C3 turboprop engines, are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the HC-144A is EADS Construcciones Aeronautic, Avenida Aragon, 404, Madrid, Spain 28022, Cage Code 0117B.</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking sources that can provide any or all of the subassemblies and parts identified and listed below. The USCG further seeks sources to establish a five year, firm-fixed price contract to purchase aircraft parts (see listing below). Only the exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. Only new items are acceptable; reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable. The USCG will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Suppliers must be able to provide necessary certifications including a Certificate of Conformance and traceability to the OEM for the below parts. Traceability means that the supplier must be able to show a clear documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part, from the OEM to the final vendor. The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.<br />PARTS:<br />P/N Nomenclature<br />LM806649-20629 AIRCRAFT BEARING<br />JLM508748-N0629 AIRCRAFT BEARING<br />L507949-20629 AIRCRAFT BEARING<br />AE3660030E0180 HOSE ASSEMBLY<br />100074 HOLD DOWN BAR<br />100078 WASHER, FLAT<br />100594 O-RING<br />100073 WEDGE<br />166925 PROTECTOR<br />361-1 CLOTH TAPE<br />173378-126 CAPILLARY ASSY<br />179001 IND., DISCHARGE<br />270276-67 CLAMP<br />171013 GAGE, PRESSURE<br />170022 VALVE, OUTLET OXYGEN<br />174290-26 MASK, THERAPEUTIC<br />174097-51 MASK, PASS/TYPE EZM900<br />4088T39P09 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />61-0467-3 INSULATOR ASSY<br />1-480704-0 HOUSING<br />ISOXS709ENF0103- SBACKSHELL<br />NMC IF1112-26 BOND-ON INDEX PIN, SH<br />NMC IF1112-25P BOND-ON INDEX PIN, L<br />C100-013110 PACKING <br />C100-016110 PACKING<br />NAS679A08 NUT<br />380AS014M1810A3 BACKSHELL<br />447HS198NF1504-4B BACKSHELL<br />J221P012 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />S2L-219 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />S2L-234 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />G30007CD BUSHING<br />G30007AD BUSHING<br />G30010AD BUSHING<br />G30020AD BUSHING<br />114-218-1702 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />113-128-1702 PACKING, PREFORMED<br />P102C10-11 PROFILE, INSERT<br />NAS1133-9R SCREW<br />WM22759/02-*02-9 WIRE<br />220VK+214J01L00416179 LIGHTED PUSH-SWITCH<br />409190 SCREW<br />V053040J WASHER<br />NAS1153-4 SCREW, CLOSE TOLERANCE<br />KENCN235-01A COCKPIT WINDOW SHADE<br />NAS1241AD3-3 RIVET SOLID<br />0860-0004 CYLON DT CELL<br />BLC5GL10F PIN<br />13-06396 SAFETY STRAP REMOVE<br />SP122D WASHER<br />2HU70 PLUG<br />PG233000-04 GASKET, BLANK PLATE<br />SD028-222 SEAL<br />SD028-226 SEAL<br />19C02-32A CLAMP<br />B3-93-1 GASKET <br />TS298M CONNECTOR, COAXIAL<br />P611845 BRUSH GAUGE<br />676-3291-002 PLUG, RUBBER<br />D56091 BLOCK<br />E0354-301 RECEPTACLE, ELECTRIC<br />25ARM300-20A30 INSULATOR <br />2315M9-3 BLADE, WINSHIELD WIPER</p>

<DESC>The IC IT Enterprise (IC ITE) (pronounced "eye-sight") is a transformative strategy to further the DNI's vision of intelligence integration by revolutionizing the IC IT operating model. IC ITE moves the IC from an agency-centric IT architecture to a common platform where the Community easily and securely shares technology, information and resources. By managing and providing the Community's IT infrastructure and services as a single enterprise, the IC will not only be more efficient, but will also establish a powerful platform to deliver more innovative and secure technology to desktops at all levels across the intelligence enterprise. These new capabilities, with seamless and secure access to Community-wide information, will positively and deeply change how users communicate, collaborate and perform their mission.
<p>The IC DTE is the "Desktop Environment" within the IC ITE DNI strategy which delivers a common suite of desktop applications and access to common services. The IC DTE is managed by the Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) consisting of a joint team assembled by DIA and NGA. The JPMO is charged with delivery and support of this desktop consisting of several basic services. One of these services is providing Unified Communications as a Service to the IC Community, beginning with DIA and NGA users worldwide (Phase 1). The next Phase (Phase 2), the JPMO will deliver an RFP for the vendor community to respond to which will encompass delivery of desktop services to the entire IC.</p>
<p>This RFI is specific to the capability of delivering a Unified Communications (UC) pilot in the IC DTE Proof of Concept. The JPMO is investigating an alternate model for delivery of services to the IC which will allow agencies more control in their adoption of the IC DTE. The delivery, known as the "Desktop Services Model" allows agency users to remain in their native agency system domain and reach out to an IC DTE domain to gain access to common services.</p>
<p>DIA is seeking assistance with a 6-month implementation of a small (&lt;1000) user Proof of Concept (PoC) pilot of a Unified Communications Suite. This effort will allow DIA to test and evaluate UC features and services suitability for the IC DTE "Desktop Services Model". This effort will also assist future vendors with an alternate implementation from which to use when proposing solutions for the IC DTE Phase 2 RFP. DIA will require training support to better understand installation and general operational requirements of the UC suite.</p>
<p>Please see the attached document for the full RFI and all additional information.</p>
<p>This RFI does not commit to any contractual agreement, nor is this RFI considered a RFP.</p>
<p>The Government will not pay for costs incurred with developing a response to this RFP.</p>
<p>Responses due via e-mail no later than 12:00pm on Friday, 19 July 2013, to the e-mail addresses detailed in the attached document. Response</p>

<DESC>Under solicitation number W52P1J-13-R-0106, the Sources Sought Synopsis of the Planned Sole Source Follow-on Contract in Support of the Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel (NSCM) Explosive Destruction System (EDS) Operations Augmenting the Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant (PCAPP) at the Pueblo Chemical Depot (PCD), Colorado was posted on 30 Apr 2013 on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps).  It requested any interested parties provide their interest, by 30 May 2013, with a description of their capabilities and experiences, as it applied to the noted areas and statement of work (SOW) requirements.  Two timely responses were received and evaluated for technical/management capabilities and experiences, primarily in EDS operational plans/procedures development, EDS permit development/modification, EDS training development and conduction, and EDS on-site operation assistance support, as it applied to the EDS deployment at PCD.   Based on this evaluation and analysis, the Government has decided to continue with the planning of the sole source follow-on contract action in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The evaluation determined that this planned follow-on contract will allow NSCM to retain these unique and/or highly specialized services in supporting of its EDS PCD operations requirements in the timeframe identified for its ongoing PCD mission/activities without a disruption to or loss of quality of these services.

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes; however, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and Part 6.302-1, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". FEMA intends to award this BPA to UNIVAR USA for the purchase of water treatment chemicals. These products are considered commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2. This action is being performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) which states, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available". A Sole Source Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been approved by the Contracting Officer and is provided as an attachment to this notice.
<p>The chemicals to be ordered most often from this proposed BPA are: Sodium Hypochlorite, 12.5% in a 55 gallon drum; DelPAC 2020 in a 55 gallon drum; Carusol 20 in a 55 gallon drum; Chlorine Gas in a 150 pound cylinder; Sulfur Dioxide in a 150 pound cylinder; Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), 40 pounds. These chemicals are needed in the daily operation of FEMA, MWEOC's Water and Sewer Treatment Plant. While other water chemical distributors can provide one or two chemicals, UNIVAR is capable of providing all the chemicals needed to remove debris, sludge, bacteria and contaminants in the water. Utilizing one vendor to provide MWEOC's water treatment chemicals has been determined to be cost effective, as well as reduces the administrative effort needed to procure these essential chemicals. UNIVAR USA is believed to be the only water treatment chemical distributor capable of providing all the specific chemicals needed to treat MWEOC's water and sewer systems; however, any water treatment chemical distributor capable of providing the required products, is requested to contact Phyllis Woodward via email at Phyllis.Woodward@fema.dhs.gov or by fax to 540-542-2631, no later than July 26, 2013. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<a href="mailto:michael.adorno@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is issuing a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors (Small Business) for the procurement of a new Flagship First Person Shooter (FPS).  The new FPS based game and tools should include, but is not limited, to the components and capabilities of the current FPS game, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2), as described in the Program Description.<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager, has a need for an FPS game to train individual Soldiers and small units in a shared semi-immersive environment.  This notice is provided to inform industry partners and solicit industry capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for the current GFT Flagship game-based simulation.  Part of the Army strategy for execution of the GFT program is to take advantage of new gaming technologies available in the commercial market whenever possible given the appropriate level of resources.  The Flagship recompete will manifest that strategy by acquiring improved technologies similar to user friendly software development, higher fidelity graphics, an ability to move across PC-platforms, web-based and mobile, and an improved interoperability capability to integrate seamlessly into the Live-Virtual-Constructive environment.<br><br>GFT game-based technologies provide semi-immersive, experiential learning opportunities to familiarize and train Soldiers in various tactical scenarios and environments.  This technology can be used to develop, train, and evaluate the decision making processes for the individual leaders as well as enhance teamwork at all levels.  The successful product will provide preplanned scenarios resembling the ones currently a part of the flagship baseline  along with the capability for the User to rapidly generate custom scenarios (both in preparation for a training event and in real time in the game) that provide training and education in subjects such as stability operations, cultural awareness, language, combat lifesaver skills, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) recognition and defeat, and various other skills required for current and future military operations - a flexible Full Spectrum Operations capability.<br><br>The current GFT flagship product, VBS2, was procured in a competitive source selection in Dec 08.  Over the last three years, the product has evolved to include capabilities such as terrain paging, improved graphic realism, IED training modules, insurgent methodology training scenarios, Special Operations Command(SOCOM) enhancements, an improved cultural and language training capability, and a terrain database plug-in that will facilitate incorporation of Synthetic Environment (SE) Core databases.  The Government has also invested in several middleware capabilities that provide additional features such as enhanced indirect fire skills training and combat lifesaver and medic training.  The required product will provide the User the ability to connect existing and future middleware via an Application Programming Interface (API) or plug-in.  This will enable the addition of new training capabilities for seamless training using the Flagship game as the user interface.  This will ensure the reuse of a multitude of Governmental and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) products and features already developed.   <br><br>Potential future capabilities that may be included in the Flagship acquisition, or as separate efforts, are as follows:<br><br>1.  Construction and Management Simulation (CMS) <br><br>This requirement is for a CMS game to support full spectrum operations that includes lethal and non-lethal tasks and missions.  The gaming solution must portray the political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructural(PMESII) conditions and associated 2d and higher order effects of decision-making relative to those conditions.  This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>2.  Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMOG)<br><br>Future procurement may include an MMOG game to support mission rehearsals and mission planning. The requirement  will allow stimulation of mission (formerly battle) command systems and other training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (TADSS).

The nuclear reactor design is based on low enriched uranium to minimize nuclear proliferation risk. It is passively safe and optimized for low power operation. Additional isotopes beyond <sup>99</sup>Mo can also be produced.</span></p>

It is the precursor for <sup>99m</sup>Tc&nbsp;which is used in a variety of medical treatments and for diagnostic imaging. Production is primarily from foreign sources and is at risk due to aging equipment at some of the key suppliers. Should a critical shortage of this isotope occur as happened in 2009, U.S.-based sources would reduce the risk to US patients.</span></p>

Sandia is seeking a company or companies to cooperatively develop and commercially produce the technology described in this posting.  It is expected that the company/companies that work with Sandia to develop and demonstrate the prototype large-scale fuel cell power generator will further develop it into a commercial product.<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories has technological expertise in hydrogen and fuel cells and is working to develop and demonstrate a prototype 100 kW power generator as a diesel genset alternative.   Such a generator will meet all emissions regulations and has the potential to save operation, maintenance, and fuel costs compared to traditional gensets.  An integral part of the development process is finding interested and capable commercialization partners that will work alongside Sandia in the design, development, and demonstration of the prototype and, pending assessment of market feasibility, will actively work to further develop it and market it as a commercial product.<br /><br />Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to design, develop, distribute, and market large fuel cell power generators.  A primary market is expected to be as a clean alternative to 50-150 kW diesel gensets.<br /><br />Expertise to be supplied by Sandia includes:  fuel cell and hydrogen technology, safety, codes and standards, and system design.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail to Ed Noma at Sandia National Laboratories, MS 9052, 7011 East Avenue, Livermore, CA 94550, email eynoma@sandia.gov, phone: 925.294.6848. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include company and contact information as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to the formation of a CRADA or WFO and subsequent commercialization of this technology.

<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Quotation Preparation Instructions</p>
<p>1) Price Quotation: The Offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the completed price schedule. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The pricing quotation shall be separate from any other portion of the quotation.  The Offeror shall propose a firm-fixed-price, FOB Destination, for each CLIN.   Contractor shall state express warranty coverage.  Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.<br />2) Technical Quotation: The Offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: <br />Technical Capability: The Offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model.  The Offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature.</p>
<p>If the Offeror is not the manufacturer, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation shall be included.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance: The Offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the Offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the Offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p><br />Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein.  The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein.  The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).

However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the Offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the Offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: All items must be new.  Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award. <br />Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the Offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an Offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to Offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>As noted in specification 7(b), stronger consideration will be given to systems with higher pumping speeds for H2.<br />As noted in specification 10, stronger consideration will be given to turbo pump systems with lower mechanical vibration at the inlet flange.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the Offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the Offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>
<p><br />1352.233-70  AGENCY PROTESTS (APR 2010) <br />(a)  An agency protest may be filed with either (1) the Contracting Officer, or (2) at a level above the Contracting Officer, with the agency Protest Decision Authority.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) TBD is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

2.  Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.  Please include contact information, to include phone number and email address, for all references. <BR> <BR>Bid Term:  vendors must provide manufacturer part number, name, and extended specifications for evaluation in order to be considered.
If the Offeror is not the manufacturer, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation shall be included. <BR> <BR>Technical Capability: Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST?s requirements. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror?s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.
Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. 
Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. <BR> <BR>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price. <BR> <BR>

<p>The Government intends to award a single purchase order from this solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a purchase order.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Proposals: The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals.</p>
<p>The Government will use a tradeoff process for this source selection. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements and provides the best value to the Government, non-price factors and price considered.<br /><br />Relative importance:<br />1. All evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are more important than price. <br />2. As the Non-Price technical rating becomes more equal between offerors, price becomes more important.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTOR #1: Demonstrated expertise, as evidenced by peer reviewed scientific publications, in the propagation of herpes viruses, their isolation by biochemical and biophysical techniques, and in the purification and analysis of related proteins and protein complexes. Total Possible Points: 25</p>

Total Possible Points: 25</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE: The offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>PRICE: An evaluation of the offeror's price proposal will be made to determine if proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical proposal. Reasonableness determinations will be made by determining if competition exists, by comparing proposed prices with established commercial and/or by comparing proposed prices with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).<br /><br />Evaluation of Options: In accordance with FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><br />The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is deemed necessary. The Government may also waive informalities and minor irregularities in the offers received.</p>
<p>In order to receive an award from NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

Global Imaging is the only company capable of maintaining, upgrading and modifying the hardware/software as required and does not allow any other companies to provide support on their equipment. <br /><br />This acquisition is being sole sourced because Global Imaging is the manufacture of the Advanced Front End Processors and the Monterey station equipment required to support the devices within the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility.<br /><br />The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334111, 1 million business size. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. <br /><br />The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to anthony.webb@noaa.gov by July 22, 2013, 11:00 a.m. local time. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-68. <br /><br />The determination to compete or not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, located in Honolulu, HI. intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to coordinate and conduct fisheries monitoring on purse seine and ring net vessels to determine the efficacy of such gear on capture rates of target pelagic and coastal tunas and non-target, or bycatch (discarded) species. Specifically, we seek a contractor to provide logistical support to monitor catches using at-sea observers and port sampling in order to provide a comparison between sampling methods to quantify effort, species composition of catch, bycatch, catch-per-unit effort and size.<br />The Philippines is one of the top fish producing countries in the world. The provisional catch of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna in 2010 was ~370,000 mt, with the commercial sector (vessels &gt;3 gross tons) comprising ~70% (Barut and Garvilles 2011). The Philippines probably has the largest number of anchored payaos (Fish Aggregating Devices, FADs) deployed in the world; however, there has been concern regarding the sustainability of payao fish catches, potential for growth overfishing, high juvenile tuna exploitation and predation and adverse ecological effects for other species of concern such as fisheries interactions with sharks and sea turtles.<br />To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide service. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this service previously. Information should provide sufficient detail that demonstrates the firm's knowledge and ability to perform the requirement. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This is a simplified acquisition estimated value not to exceed $150,000.00. The entire solicitation is attached. No further solicitation documents will be issued. Interested parties can obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation from this site. Faxed requests can be sent to 808-983-2900, Attn: Bonnie Oshiro. All questions must be submitted in writing to Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov or faxed to 808-983-2900. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required services as stated herein. Interested parties must respond within (15) days after publication of this notice. Faxed responses and/or questions must be in writing and can be sent to 808-983-2900, Attn: Bonnie Oshiro or emailed at Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov. The Government will review each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above. Detailed information must be submitted by email to the address noted below by 3:00 PM local (HST) Hawaii Standard Time. Email Address: Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov. Questions of any nature must be addressed in writing as NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.<br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541690 with a size standard of $14 million.<br />The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must have a valid Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS) and be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/, with an active status, to be eligible for award. A DUNs number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose.

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<SUBJECT>CONDUCT CURRENT AND ONGOING HMS SAMPLING PROGRAM USING CPFV FLEET AS PLATFORM
<SOLNBR>WAD-13-NFFR7000-03348
<RESPDATE>072213
<CONTACT>Melvin N. Fondue, Phone (206) 526-6043, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for service to conduct current and ongoing HMS sampling program using CPFY fleet as platform:<br />Period of performance from August 1, 2013 to December 31 2015 <br />I. Introduction<br />NOAA has a long standing collaborative relationship with the Sport Fishing Association of California (SAC) and the fleet has participated in a number of research programs. For example, in 2007 NOAA and SAC started a biological sampling program for highly migratory species (HMS) in the Southern California Bight. The program uses the commercial passenger fishing vessel fleet (CPFV) as a platform to sample a range of highly migratory species. When space is available, trips are provided for free to the NOAA biological sampler, otherwise vessels are chartered. SAC represents 100% of the 161 CPFV vessels operating from San Diego to Santa Barbara and thus they are uniquely positioned to coordinate vessel charters or spots on vessels.
<p>II. Background<br />The extensive CPFV fleet, based out of San Diego, provides a unique platform to collect valuable biological data on a range HMS listed in the Pacific Fisheries Management Council HMS management plan. Additionally, as these species typically co-occur with protected species (cetaceans and pinnipeds) the CPFV fleet and captains have extensive knowledge regarding the locations, abundance, and potential interactions with marine mammals and as such represent a unique opportunity for studies of these species in a fishery context. In the late summer and fall large numbers of CPFV vessels are on the water daily in the Southern California Bight. These vessel captains have extensive knowledge of local waters. For the biological sampling program specifically, the samples are typically donated by anglers on the SAC vessels. For most of these species, including tuna, mahi mahi and yellowtail, very little basic biological data is currently being collected. This contract for vessel time is a continuation of the biological sampling program and falls within a larger program to develop an ecosystems approach to management as called for under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Funds are provided by the Cooperative Research Program.</p>
<p>III. Description of Work and Services<br />Task 1. SAC will help coordinate placement of NOAA personnel on existing charters when space is available.</p>
<p>Task 2. When space on existing trips is not available or adequate to meet the research needs, SAC will coordinate a charter based on guidance from NOAA personnel. NOAA personnel will help coordinate any charters and determine what vessels and trip durations are appropriate. The actual time and vessels used will vary based on direction from NOAA personnel. Costs will be consistent with those charged the general public for similar services.</p>
<p>IV. Deliverables<br />No later than December 31, 2015, the contractor will provide space on existing trips as appropriate and provide a charter vessels to support research operations as directed by NOAA personnel.</p>
<p>V. Non-Personal Service Contract Statement<br />Contractor employees performing services under this order will be controlled, directed and supervised at all times by management personnel of the contractor. Contractor employees will perform independent of and without the supervision of any Government official. Actions of contractor employees may not be interpreted or implemented in any manner that results in any contractor employee creating or modifying Federal policy, obligating the appropriated funds of the U.S. Government, overseeing the work of Federal employees, providing direct personal services to any Federal employee or otherwise violating the prohibitions set forth in Parts 7.5 and 37.1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government will perform the inspection and acceptance of the completed work.</p>
<p>VI. Information Security<br />The C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>VI. Principal Contacts<br />The program contacts will be:<br />John Hyde john.hyde@noaa.gov, 858 546-7086<br />Nick Wegner nick.wegner@noaa.gov, 858 546-7080</p>

A proposal must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide<br />complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />A. Technical Acceptability - Initially, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the offeror's<br />Technical Requirements on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. The proposals shall<br />be evaluated against the following subfactors:<br />1. Recent/Relevant Experience. The government will evaluate the extent to which an offeror's specific<br />experience is directly related to the work required by the solicitation. Moreover, consideration will be given to<br />whether the experience is considered recent (either on-going or completed within the last five years) and relevant<br />(e.g., whether it is considered similar in type, size, scope, and complexity). The Government will evaluate the<br />offerors based on information contained in attachment 1, Submission of Recent/Relevant Experience.<br />2. Licenses. Offeror's submission of certificates of skill licenses for (a) 1st or 2nd class architect and (b) 1st or 2nd<br />class architect sekou kanri-gishi. Note to Offerors: A technical proposal rated Unacceptable will not be considered for award. There will be no point scores assigned, only Acceptable or Unacceptable. In addition, the Government shall use the following technical acceptable/unacceptable ratings definitions when assigning technical ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable (DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table A-1).<br />Table 1, Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating<br />Description<br />Acceptable<br />Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable<br />Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />B. Price Evaluation. Lastly, the Government shall rank all technically acceptable offerors by price. The price<br />evaluation will document the reasonableness, realism, and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.<br />C. After evaluation of both the Technical Requirements and Pricing Submission as specified in the solicitation, the<br />Contracting Officer will select that responsible source whose offer is technically acceptable, considering only the<br />criteria included in the solicitation, and which offers the lowest evaluation price.<br />D. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Offerors may<br />be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal such as technical acceptability. Communication conducted to<br />resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to<br />award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br />E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The<br />Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br />(End of Provision)<br />CONST-M-7401 REJECTION OF OFFERS<br />(a) Offer on All: Offerors must propose on all item(s). Failure to do so shall be cause for rejection of offer. (Applies only to solicitations containing more than one (1) line item).<br />(b) Separate Changes: Separate changes in any form, are not solicited. Offers containing separate changes will be rejected.<br />(End of provision)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF23356521A is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses under NAICS Code 541620 with size standard not exceeding 7 million dollars. <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 requires all labor and expertise to conduct research into testing for the evaluation of an advanced oxidation alternative to the current biological groundwater containment treatment system and a cost effective in-situ smoldering thermal treatment system technology to destroy contaminants in place. <br>   <br> Specific tasks are listed below:  <br>  <br> CLIN 0001: Pilot Remediation Technologies to be evaluated at the Zephyr site for Environmental Processes Remediation. (Evaluating a mobile advanced oxidation system that can be connected to the current plumbing on-site.)  <br>  <br> Evaluate mobile advanced oxidation process (AOP) unit for pilot testing at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI capable of replacing current biological treatment system.  The unit must be multi-use technology with the specific combination of AOP/cavitation/electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents.  The unit must be capable of a flow through range of 400-3400 gallons per minute. The unit should be mobile, self-powered with no reject or waste stream outside the return or effluent stream.  The unit should be capable of limited to no off-gas of breakdown constituents including ozone.  The unit should be capable of online operation within 24-48 hours of mobilization to the site. The unit must be capable of degrading both chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons including both gasoline and fuel oil #1 from site groundwater. Evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment by an accredited laboratory using EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs), EPA SW 846 Method 6020 metals analysis, Total dissolved solids (TDS), and Dissolved Oxygen. The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the pilot scale evaluation. The contractor must supply the mobile oxidation treatment system to include all transportation costs, all labor and material to connect to the current system, operator labor, sample labor, sample vials and all analytical cost. The contractor must also return the onsite system to its previous operational condition/state after evaluation. No change orders that include additional cost to this evaluation/SOW will be accepted. Contractor must coordinate site treatment operation with both ERDC and MDEQ so the proper oversight can be scheduled and conducted. (Must be a complete turnaround package.)  <br>  <br> The unit will treat the contaminated groundwater. ERDC will observe the system operation and make sure that the contractor takes samples taken from both inlet and outlet of the system labeled, cataloged properly on a chain of custody form then shipped in appropriate container(s) to an approved laboratory for analysis. The sampling, cataloging, chain of custody, etc. criteria are specifically stated within each EPA Methods listed. <br>  <br> The contaminants in the groundwater to be treated by the mobile treatment unit are Oil Range Organics (ORO), Diesel Range Organics (DRO), and Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) compounds.  The contaminant concentrations pumped from the recovery wells/system may range from hundreds of parts per billion to thousands of parts per billion of total BTEX.  The actual contaminant concentrations are unknown and believed to exist in mostly free phase but non-aqueous phase liquids may be present.   <br> There are no documents or background reports available and no previous pilot studies have been conducted on site. No raw water or influent analytical data results are available. There are no site maps, piping, system schematics, or Process & Instrument Diagram (P&ID) diagrams available of the current treatment system.  <br>  <br> The specific combination of AOP treatments must include cavitation and electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents. The pilot study should be conducted within a sufficient time frame to determine whether this system is appropriate for the site and should meet MDEQ requirements for discharge and will be evaluated for cost per gallon treated and efficiency. The duration of the mobile unit test should be less than 1 week. All electrical power must provided by the mobile unit. A site walk is not planned. The award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0001 $__________ <br>  <br> CLIN 0002: Bench scale testing of a self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment technology using a site soil sample containing free product (gasoline and fuel oil #1) from the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI. The test will have to demonstrate exothermic oxidation of the target contaminants in the sample tested under a process that is self-sustaining without continuous external energy input after initial ignition. The test should demonstrate engineering control of the self-sustaining smoldering process and also the ability to terminate the process under controlled measures.  The contractor's offer must demonstrate that the testing apparatus and supporting infrastructure as well as the expertise to perform the testing has been secured.  Bench scale evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment equivalent to EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs). The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the bench scale testing. <br>  <br> Self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment uses smoldering combustion to destroy contaminants.  The goal of the self sustained smoldering bench test is to determine if this treatment technology is applicable to this site. The most concentrated contaminants remaining in the subsurface are believed to be in either sand, silt and silty sand at a depth between 25 - 35 ft below ground surface (bgs). The contaminants could be shallower or deeper. The volume of contaminants are assumed over 1,000,000 gallons in the form of DRO, GRO, ORO in concentrations range from non detect to over 100,000,000 ug/kg. The distribution of free phase and non-aqueous phase liquids is not known. There is no map available Soil contaminants sample cores must be extracted by drilling only no excavator can be used. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0002 $______________ <br>  <br> Option CLIN 0003: Successful treatment of bench-scale smoldering testing will lead to a pilot scale evaluation at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI if funds are available.  <br>  <br> There is no in-situ designed approach at this time, therefore the Pilot treatment is undefined. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0003 $_______________ <br>  <br> Parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, on the items quoted including, but not limited to, technical brochures, specification sheets indicating technical ability, pictures, etc. sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.   <br>  <br> Price shall include any shipping, FOB Destination.  <br>  <br> FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

<DESC>The VA National Acquisition Center (NAC) is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Great Lakes Consolidated Pharmacy (CMOP) to interested sources which manufacture multi-packing equipment. The multi-packing system shall automatically package multiple prescription items from a single tote and associated paper work and one envelope at a rate not less than 1700 prescriptions per hour and must be capable of installing all necessary patient instruction information, pharmaceuticals, and refill slips into the proper packages with 100% accuracy.  The system will share the same database as our existing pack stations but process independently. The system will need to occupy the existing facility footprint, integrate with current operations software, and minimize changes/additions to the current hardware and support equipment. 

This system is to be installed at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Great Lakes Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP). The solicitation will result in a single award contract. NAICS code 333993 and Small Business Size Standard 500 employees are applicable to determine business size standard.  Request for Proposals shall be issued on July 8, 2013. There will be a suggested site visit scheduled on July 22, 2013.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance / Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and is based in Rangoon, Burma.  The OTI Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Burma supports the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Burma. In particular, the OTI program provides assistance to support the nascent political transition in Burma. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Field Program Manger in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Field Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee (e.g. the OTI Deputy Country Representative), the Field Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-12 level:</p>

<p>&bull;	Assist in meeting and collaborating with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, implementing partners, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, international donors, and others key players who may be interested in OTI activities or who have important information related to the start up or ongoing development of OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in regularly communicating and sharing program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, U.N. organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>

<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>At the GS-13 level:</p>
<p>At the GS-13 level, the Field Program Manager will perform the same duties as the GS-12, but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and more independence of action.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://transition.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd06_10.pdf</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Burma</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance / Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and is based in Rangoon, Burma.  The OTI Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Burma supports the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future State Department and USAID presence in Burma. In particular, the OTI program provides assistance to support the nascent political transition in Burma. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Field Program Manger in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Field Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://transition.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd06_10.pdf</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable The offeror must be able to meet all requirements outlined in the PWS <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS Monday 24 June 2013 AT 1300EST .

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<p>No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p><strong>14. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:</strong> The Government will use Best Value Source Selection Procedures to evaluate offers and determine the best value. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented; whose proposal conforms to the solicitations requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation); and is determined, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives USTDA the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

<DESC>FBO Posting HHM402-13-R-0074 <br />Financial Determination Responsibility<br />Questions and Answers 1 - 10, posted July 08, 2013
<p>Q1. Is this new work? If not, can you provide the incumbent contractor and contract number associated?<br />A1. Currently there is no contractor. In the past, the Government has had contracts with Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Experian Financial Services for financial responsiblility determinations.</p>
<p>Q2. Re the NAICS identified for this solicitation. We understand how this service may fit into the 519130 NAICS code; however, we also believe that 561450 (Credit Bureaus), is the more appropriate one. Would you consider changing the NAICS to 561450 or provide rationale for using NAICS 519130? <br />A2. The NAICS listed is not required for an offeror. The NAICS will not be changed.</p>
<p>Q3. As a small business under NAICS 519130 (and 561450), we understand that Volume II, Small Business Participation, is not required to be submitted. <br />A3. Correct.</p>
<p>Q4. Do you require a placeholder volume or are we required to make some notice within our Technical or Price/Cost volumes that Volume II is not required to be submitted?<br />A4. It should be obvious from an Offeror's SAM listing and entire proposal whether the small business participation plan is applicable.</p>
<p>Q5. Please clarify the submission requirements (dates, times, copy numbers, etc). For example:<br />SF33 States original &amp; 5 copies NLT 7/18 @ 1:00pm; <br />Section L, paragraphs 7 &amp; 8 indicate original by email on 7/18 and 5 hard copies by 7/19 @ 5pm; <br />The Table (page 27) table indicates 1 written original, 4 written copies, 1 email original. <br />A5. The email submission must be by 1 PM EST on Thursday, July 18, 2013. The five hard copies, which are identified as written, must be received prior to 5 PM on Friday, July 19, 2013.</p>
<p>Q6. Re Section L, paragraph 2. Please clarify submission requirements. Will the cost/price volume be deemed responsive if the completed SF33 (with price/cost information completed) and clauses (with necessary fill ins completed) included in that volume or do they needs to be submitted separately? <br />A6. The Cost/Price volume should be responsive if the filled in SF33 pricing information is attached, along with necessary clauses.</p>
<p>Q7. Re Page 5, 4th bullet from the bottom of the page (Tax Information). Please clarify the specific type of information you are requesting here. <br />A7. Information concerning a company's tax information as it pertains to financial responsibility.</p>
<p>Q8. Re Page 6, 1st Bullet (Searches based on user's known data points). We understand completely the need to ensure accuracy of the search returns. The examples provided in the solicitation have some limiting factors. For example, DUNS (a Dun &amp; Bradstreet proprietary numbering system), CAGE (a government provided identification number that is not in most business credit reporting systems) and TIN (while a TIN is associated with a company, a small business (i.e., sole proprietorship) would likely use their SSN and therefore the request would contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII, i.e., Privacy Act information) which requires specific protections (encryption). Are these data points mandatory search items or can a vendor propose alternate data points that will also ensure singularity of the information? <br />A8. "Searches need to be based on user's know[n] data points ... e.g., DUNS, CAGE and/or TIN." The data points provided are examples and are not mandatory.</p>
<p>Q9. Re Page 6, 7th Bullet (Direct explanatory/clarifying...). The solicitation desires companies to submit pricing based on a flat rate subscription. Historical data or a government best estimate on the expected usage is critical for development of an accurate pricing strategy. Specifically, we request: <br />Historical usage data, or provide an estimate on the number of reports requested per year? <br />Clarification regarding if reports are for US companies only, or if international companies are to be included in this service. <br />Re the statement "Direct explanatory/clarifying or amplifying support...may be needed on occasion...". Please provide any information that clarifies what details may be required to satisfy this requirement. <br />Please provide clarification if pricing is to be submitted as outlined on the schedule - per year (page 2), or monthly (as alluded to on page 6, 7th bullet). <br />A9. Historical data shows roughly 100 reports requested every 12 months. The primary use is for data on U.S. companies. For example, data may be provided that represents a score, and clarifying data explaining that score may be needed. The Government has attempted to show that various pricing alternatives will be considered along with concerns we have experienced.</p>
<p>Q10. What is the relationship of the user base between HHM402-13-R-0074 and FBO Posting 402-0099-13 as the RFI capability would cover this requirement?<br />A10. The user base identified in HHM402-13-R-0074 is acquisitions professionals.</p>

<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 100% set-aside to SBA certified 8(a) concerns on or about 15 July 2013 for the acquisition of Grounds Maintenance Services to be performed at McConnell AFB, Kansas. All responsible 8(a) concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be evaluated using Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO) evaluation factors with performance being significantly more important than price. The Government intends to issue an award to a single 8(a) concern under a performance-based Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Requirements type contract on or about 1 August 2013. Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one (1) base period of performance (one year, from 1 September 2013 through 31 August 2014) and may include up to four (4) option periods of performance (each one year in duration from 1 September and ending 31 August running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance). There is no guarantee that any option periods of performance may be exercised.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform Grounds Maintenance Services at McConnell AFB, Kansas, to the standards specified within the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The successful contractor shall perform services necessary to (1) ensure grounds maintenance is performed in a manner that maintains healthy grass, trees, shrubs and plants, (2) to engage in preventive grounds maintenance actions to present clean, neat and professional base, military family housing, airfield and missile site appearances, (3) maintain Government irrigation systems, and (4) remove snow and ice to the standards specified within the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 1 June 2013, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory S.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (NOV 2012), the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory S.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

Once the RFP is released, instructions for obtaining it will be posted to this announcement. Please feel free to contact John Conlin with any questions (john.conlin3.civ@mail.mil, 508-233-6164)     <br>          <br>     -----------------------     <br>     SUMMARY      <br>      This is a notice of a proposed contract action issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.203(a). The Government intends to issue a solicitation and award up to 1 contract for the services described below. This acquisition is set aside 100% for small businesses, as defined below. This notice is not a solicitation; information on release of the solicitation is provided below. The Government will use the procedures of FAR Part 12  quote mark Acquisition of Commercial Items quote mark  for this acquisition.      <br>            <br>      BACKGROUND      <br>      The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) conducts Navy Medicine Research and includes subject areas such as: (1) combat casualty care research, including traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, wounds from improvised explosive devices, etc.; (2) non-communicable disease research, including cancer research; and (3) infectious disease research, including respiratory or enteric disease research. NHRC performs both intramural and extramural research, the latter meaning that the work must be outsourced or contracted out to industry or academia performers. Therefore, NHRC is in need of Research Acquisition Specialist (RAS) contractor personnel who understand the aforementioned subject areas significantly enough to act on the relevant regulations and statute but can also translate the requirements of these subject areas into meaningful acquisition documents that a Contracting Officer can execute on. Of particular concern is that the RAS is knowledgeable of, experienced with, and can successfully act on regulations, statutes, and protocols such as those relevant to the FDA clinical trial process, which may include human use and/or animal use.      <br>            <br>      REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE      <br>      The RAS must be able to develop and administer acquisition documents containing human-use requirements. A contract action that involves human-use research does require assurance certification by the contractor performer. Any contract that does require research on human subjects requires that the DoD component be responsible for contractor oversight of compliance with 32 CFR Part 219, Protection of Human Subjects; and that the Government personnel responsible for such oversight is the client's Human Research Protection Official as defined by DFAR S 252.235-7004, Protection of Human Subjects. The RAS must be at a level of qualification sufficiently enough to support these Government representatives through the development and administration of acquisition documents. All research needs to be determined to be compliant with Federal and DoD regulations for protecting human subjects. All studies similarly need to be compliant with the requirements of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Further, evolving human-subject protection regulations need to be investigated and training plans developed to educate researchers as to their human subject responsibilities. Contractor performers shall support Institutional Review Board (IRB) functions and HIPAA Privacy Office functions by reviewing all agency studies, including those in the areas of medical resource planning, enhancing performance during shipboard and ground operations, investigating and monitoring disease incidence among military personnel, development of computer systems for monitoring the physiologic status of individual patients, clinical research studies, survey administration efforts, and evaluating physiological effects of various agents found in military operational environments. Such support shall include analyzing research protocols to determine compliance with relevant human subject protection regulations and drafting administrative correspondence detailing review proceedings and findings. Support shall also include development of educational materials, monitoring of research, and database development for tracking of research protocols. Therefore, the RAS must be able to understand the aforementioned and act on such.      <br>            <br>      A contract action that involves animal use does require assurance and accreditation by the contractor performer. Any contract that does require the use of animals in research shall be compliant with all applicable Federal and DoD regulations, specifically including 7 U.S.C. 2131 et. Seq. and 9 CFR 1-4,  quote mark Animal Welfare Act quote mark ; DoDI 3216.01,  quote mark Use of Animals in DoD Programs quote mark ; and specific DoD component management plans. Evolving animal use and care regulations need to be investigated and training plans developed to educate researchers regarding their animal use and care responsibilities. Contractor performers shall support Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) functions and comply with any procedures required for IACUC approval, including research protocol submission, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) accreditation, DHHS Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) assurance, and USDA site inspections. Therefore, the RAS must be able to understand the aforementioned and act on such.      <br>            <br>      There are many more regulations, statutes, and protocols within the medicine research sector that the RAS must be able to comprehend sufficiently enough to assure that all necessary provisions are included in the acquisition documents and that that contract administration is of sufficient caliber to assure that these medical research regulations, statutes, and protocols are being adhered to by the contractor performer.      <br>      Such services are non-personal in nature and do not include inherently Governmental duties.      <br>            <br>      RELEASE OF SOLICITATION      <br>      The Government will set aside the entire requirement for small business concerns. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541611  quote mark Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, quote mark  which has a size standard of $14,000,000 in annual receipts. Concerns with annual receipts less than or equal to $14,000,000 will be considered small businesses for this acquisition.       <br>            <br>      The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) no earlier than 21 June 2013. Proposals will be due 30 calendar days following release of the RFP.  The Government will only consider proposals offered from responsible small businesses.       <br>            <br>      The Government intends to award no more than 1 firm fixed priced, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a term of 36 months using the procedures of FAR Part 12  quote mark Acquisition of Commercial Items. quote mark       <br>            <br>      QUESTIONS      <br>            <br>      Questions about this acquisition may be directed to John Conlin (john.conlin3.civ@mail.mil, 508-233-6164)      <br>

<DESC>Q&A #1: <br> QUESTION: will the Government consider relevant ONLY storm-water management systems projects (thus restricting competition) or any project attributable to SOA OG6 statement (in order to promote full an open competition)? <br>  <br> ANSWER:  The SOA is evaluated separately from the Experience Factor as stated in the RFP (Request for Proposal). The required SOA qualification is evaluated as a separate factor. The Experience Factor requires that the bidder has performed three projects with certain characteristics as described in the RFP which will be evaluated independently from SOA.  The Government will solely use the Experience information provided as required by the RFP.  The Government will not rely on possession of a SOA OG6 to evaluate the Experience Factor.  <br>  <br>  <br>

Home detention services (for home detention placements) are specifically defined in Chapter 10, Programs, of the aforementioned SOW as well. This will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2.</p>
<p>The guaranteed minimum for RRC services for in-house beds is estimated to be 89% male and 11% female for the one-year base period and each of the four, one-year option periods thereafter, if options are exercised.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home detention placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<a href="mailto:michael.adorno@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is issuing a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors (Small Business) for the procurement of a new Flagship First Person Shooter (FPS).  The new FPS based game and tools should include, but is not limited, to the components and capabilities of the current FPS game, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2), as described in the Program Description.<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI, through requirements provided by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager, has a need for an FPS game to train individual Soldiers and small units in a shared semi-immersive environment.  This notice is provided to inform industry partners and solicit industry capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for the current GFT Flagship game-based simulation.  Part of the Army strategy for execution of the GFT program is to take advantage of new gaming technologies available in the commercial market whenever possible given the appropriate level of resources.  The Flagship recompete will manifest that strategy by acquiring improved technologies similar to user friendly software development, higher fidelity graphics, an ability to move across PC-platforms, web-based and mobile, and an improved interoperability capability to integrate seamlessly into the Live-Virtual-Constructive environment.<br><br>GFT game-based technologies provide semi-immersive, experiential learning opportunities to familiarize and train Soldiers in various tactical scenarios and environments.  This technology can be used to develop, train, and evaluate the decision making processes for the individual leaders as well as enhance teamwork at all levels.  The successful product will provide preplanned scenarios resembling the ones currently a part of the flagship baseline  along with the capability for the User to rapidly generate custom scenarios (both in preparation for a training event and in real time in the game) that provide training and education in subjects such as stability operations, cultural awareness, language, combat lifesaver skills, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) recognition and defeat, and various other skills required for current and future military operations - a flexible Full Spectrum Operations capability.<br><br>The current GFT flagship product, VBS2, was procured in a competitive source selection in Dec 08.  Over the last three years, the product has evolved to include capabilities such as terrain paging, improved graphic realism, IED training modules, insurgent methodology training scenarios, Special Operations Command(SOCOM) enhancements, an improved cultural and language training capability, and a terrain database plug-in that will facilitate incorporation of Synthetic Environment (SE) Core databases.  The Government has also invested in several middleware capabilities that provide additional features such as enhanced indirect fire skills training and combat lifesaver and medic training.  The required product will provide the User the ability to connect existing and future middleware via an Application Programming Interface (API) or plug-in.  This will enable the addition of new training capabilities for seamless training using the Flagship game as the user interface.  This will ensure the reuse of a multitude of Governmental and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) products and features already developed.   <br><br>Potential future capabilities that may be included in the Flagship acquisition, or as separate efforts, are as follows:<br><br>1.  Construction and Management Simulation (CMS) <br><br>This requirement is for a CMS game to support full spectrum operations that includes lethal and non-lethal tasks and missions.  The gaming solution must portray the political, military, economic, social, informational, and infrastructural(PMESII) conditions and associated 2d and higher order effects of decision-making relative to those conditions.  This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>2.  Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Games (MMOG)<br><br>Future procurement may include an MMOG game to support mission rehearsals and mission planning. The requirement  will allow stimulation of mission (formerly battle) command systems and other training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (TADSS). This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>3.  Real Time Strategy (RTS)<br><br>Plans for FY13 and beyond may include procurement of an RTS game to support full spectrum operations. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>4.  Turn Based Strategy (TBS) <br><br>Future procurement endeavors may include a TBS game to support decision making skills at all force echelons. This procurement may be an addition to the current GFT suite of games or part of the flagship product. <br><br>Constraints<br><br>1.  The contractor shall provide all the features of VBS2.<br><br>2.  The contractor shall use industry standards for model, terrain and other content imported into the game. <br><br>3.  The Flagship will be capable of importing and exporting Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) simulation terrain and Common Moving Models as well as One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) behavioral models.<br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates this requirement be fulfilled by a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The Government intends to award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated herein and to submit a written response (questions and/or feedback) by the closing date of this posting.  The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections in order to allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.<br><br>QUANTITIES:  The acquisition will be for an Army-wide or enterprise license for one or more commercial games.<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $44.5 million over five years. The majority of the cost is expected to be an annual licensing fee that includes an update and technical support for the software.<br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) requests contractors who are responding to the Draft RFP posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) as well as FEDBIZOPPS to submit their questions/feedback to the following POC: Michael.adorno@us.army.mil. All questions/comments are due no later than 3:00PM EST on 12 July 2012. Please identify your Business Size Standard.  If vendor is a small business, provide how you plan on meeting the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.<br><br>DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use the information received to assist in the development of the GFT Flagship requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>   <br><br>

<DESC>The U.S. Government seeks 11,900 USF of office space and 20 reserved parking spaces within the below-defined delineated area. The lease shall be a full service lease, including all utilities, janitorial&nbsp;services, and parking. The term shall be&nbsp;10 years, with the initial 5 years as a firm term. Janitorial services shall be provided during normal business hours. The space shall be contiguous space on one floor when available. If contiguous space is not available but an offeror can provide the square footage requirement in one building location, a maximum of 25% of the overall square footage requirement can be located one or two floors above or below the main space offered. It is preferable not to have space located on the ground floor of a facility; however, if a space on the ground floor is an interior space or a windowed space with privacy film, the government will consider it. The space shall not be adjacent to outside fire escapes, ledges, or mezzanines and in some cases, balconies. The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;must not&nbsp;be collocated in buildings or areas that handle, store, or ship Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT). Roof top access required for installation and maintenance of vertical antennas. All roof top mounted devices will require cabling from roof top location to designated space within building. Antennas will be placed on non-penetrating roof mount sytems using standard cement blocks for ballast and anchor. Antennas require vertical clearance of 25 to 50 feet and free of any building obstruction so to reduce transmission interference and reception of Satellite signal. Building must be able to accomodate heavy visitor access. 24 hour/7 days per week&nbsp;access to building and parking required.

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 located at 1111 North General Bruce Drive, Temple, TX 76504-7451 is hereby publishing a notice of award to Valor Healthcare, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Government Business, Inc.) located at 500 W. Main Street, 19th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202.  The North Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Sam Rayburn Memorial Veterans Center, Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) Program Office, 1201 East 9th Street, Bonham, TX 75418 has a CBOC in Sherman, TX that services 3675 enrolled veteran beneficiaries within the Grayson County TX catchment area.  CBOCS are established within geographical (usually by county) catchment areas that have an established veteran patient population outside of the greater metropolitan areas that larger VA Medical Centers are normally located.  The CBOC allows veterans greater access to care and take away the burden of traveling to larger cities, such as Dallas, TX (for the Sherman, TX CBOC patient population) often hours from their homes.  The Sherman, TX CBOC is a Per Patient Member CBOC and is owned and operated by Valor Healthcare, Inc.  This two month continuation of services contract is required while a long term replacement contract is pursued through the acquisition lifecycle.  The J&A is attached in accordance with FAR Part 5.  The value of the contract is an estimated $372,516.00.  In accordance with VHA policy, direct patient care cannot be disrupted at any time to veteran beneficiaries.  This award guarantees non-interruption in the care of veteran beneficiaries living within the Sherman, TX (Grayson County TX) catchment area.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs
Program Contracting Activity Central, (PCAC) 6150 Oak Tree Blvd. Suite 300
Independence, Ohio 44131

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
The Department of Veterans Affairs Program Contracting Activity Central (VA-PCAC) intends to execute an order for the installation of two electronic reclosers to be installed at each metering location at the North Little Rock VA Medical Center. The VA will be installing a 1.3 MW Solar Photovoltaic Distributed Generation System; therefore they require electronic reclosers before they can start this project. The purchase order will be firm fixed price.

VISN 16 Facility: 
Eugene J. Towbin Healthcare Center 
2200 Fort Roots Drive
North Little Rock, AR 72114
(501) 257-1000

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
Description of Services: The VA at North Little Rock, AR is installing a 1.3 MW Solar Photovoltaic Distributed Generation System. In order to install this system they are requiring that electronic reclosers be installed at each metering location feeding the VA Medical Center. The VA Medical Center is currently being fed from two different distribution circuits so they require two reclosers to be installed. 

Estimated Dollar Value: $100,000.00
		Required Delivery Date: 09/30/2013

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1)
The solar project being installed at the North Little Rock VA Medical Center has required, due to safety reasons, the servicing utility, North Little Rock Electric Department, to upgrade the connections and equipment on the utility side of the service line.  The utility and its subcontractors are the only entities authorized to perform this service.  The utility owns the lines that will be upgraded and does have the experience, expertise and authority to provide the appropriate level of effort to complete these demand side management services.  The utility has, through years of beneficial technical advice and utility distribution services, gained unique knowledge of the energy use and demand conditions at Eugene J. Towbin VA Medical Center in North Little Rock, AR.


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:
North Little Rock Electric Department and their subcontractors are the only authorized companies that are authorized to perform work on their utility lines. Therefore, offers cannot be solicited from other potential sources.

6.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
Independent Government Cost Estimate Received from the Contracting Officer's Representative, (COR), Marty Risner. 

7.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Market research was conducted by holding discussions with North Little Rock Electric Department, the utility provider. These lines on which this equipment will be installed are owned by the utility. North Little Rock Electric Department has stated the following "Because of the technical nature of the metering, reclosers, and upgrades that we are preforming on the line up to the demarcation point of our primary meter between our electric distribution grid and your NLR VA Hospital's electric distribution system, only my employees and/or subcontractors can work on your metering system, installing the reclosers to upgrade the system, in order to have a solar PV system later installed."

8.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE AWARD FOR THE FOLLOWING: <br>  <br> FLIGHTLAB SOFTWARE UPGRADE AND SUPPORT on existing licenses from 1 September 2013 - 31 August 2014. FLIGHTLAB is a flight simulation program that stands in the critical path of the UH-60M AH-64D, CH-47D/F, and OH-58 platforms. FLIGHTLAB is also used for technology development to include load-sharing engine projects, sling load analysis, or studies to improve autorotation performance. Advanced Rotorcraft Technology, Inc. is the company that produces FLIGHTLAB, and is the sole source for the FLIGHTLAB package because it directly markets its own software rather than operating through resellers. FLIGHTLAB is used to support all aviation platforms supported by the Aviation Engineering Directorate. AED wishes to maintain its current licenses of FLIGHTLAB software with support as a supply item. <br>  <br> Authority Cited: This justification meets the requirements of FAR 6.302-1 <br>  <br> Reason for Authority Cited: FLIGHTLAB software is proprietary and unique only to one provider. This product is essential to mission requirements of the Aviation Engineering Directorate. Other similar products do not meet nor can be modified to meet these requirements. <br>  <br> Any interested vendors feel that they could meet this requirement should contact MSG Barrett Taylor @ barrett.s.taylor.mil@mail.mil no later than COB (EST) Wednesday, July 10th 2013.
