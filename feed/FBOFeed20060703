For purposes of the SBIR program, a small business concern is any business concern that, on the date of award, (1) is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States, which operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to the United States economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; (2) is in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture there can be no more than 49 percent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture; (3) is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens, in the United States; and (4) has, including its affiliates, no more than 500 employees.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration & Customs Enforcement intends to negotiate a contract extension with the incumbent contractor, The Geo Group, a large business concern, to manage and operate the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located at United States Naval Air Station (USNAS) Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba.  A two-month extension is required for the period of August 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006 with an additional one-month option period, October 1, 2006 through October 31, 2006. The NAICS Code is 561612 and the Size Standard is $11.5 million. The Geo Group, Inc. is presently providing services for all operational aspects of the MOC related to safety, security and accountability of the migrant population. Services provided include operation and management of the migrant population according to security and other classification considerations, intake/release procedures, maintenance of a perpetually current electronic population roster, housing and job assignments, accountability through direct observation, physical counts, development and enforcement of migrant rules and responsibilities, control of the (MOC) secure perimeter, transportation of migrants in contractor owned vehicles to programs and service on GTMO, and facilitating the delivery of programs and services by Government organizations or representatives.  The performance location is one of the most secure and remote military bases in the world. Employee recruitment is difficult due to isolation of the performance location and potential separation from family. The two-month extension with the one-month option period is required to award a new contract with an anticipated start date of October 1, 2006. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions pertaining to the publication shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to Linda.Holder@dhs.gov or FAX to 949-360-3013.

<DESC>The Office of Clinical Pharmacology (or Center for Drug Evaluation and Research), FDA intends to issue solicitation Number FDA-SOL-06-00258 to award a noncompetitive contract to Kaiser Research Foundation Institute in Oakland, CA. to study the value of pharmacogenetics in determining the proper dose, efficacy, and safety of warfarin therapy. The amount of this contract shall not exceed $139,000 on the part of the FDA.  Kaiser will be providing in kind services in part for patient management, genotyping facilities and the assay management. The contractor will specifically compare a "CYP2C9 and VKORC1-genotype-based" dosing algorithm and a “standard-of-care” dosing algorithm in effective anticoagulation after warfarin therapy.  Kaiser is the only domestic source qualified to perform the needed studies by virtue of its access to a large number of  specific patient populations (required for this study) via a network of well-established anticoagulation centers, its unique laboratory capability to analyze the VKORC1 gene via a newly established and complex technology, in addition to the simultaneous analysis of CYP2C9 gene, to obtain accurately and expeditiously genotyping information of both genes (within 24 hours after initiation of warfarin treatment- required for this study), its extensive experience in managing patients across all anticoagulation centers within its network, and its capability to perform research involving human subjects in compliance with OHRP regulations and guidelines.  It will cost the government additional time and effort to duplicate what Kaiser has pre-worked on their own to establish its network of anticoagulation centers with trained pharmacists and well-established anticoagulation protocols.  All of the above factors, taken together, makes Kaiser uniquely qualified for carrying out this study. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Goverment intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FDA 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Debra Norris, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-5893, Fax 301-757-5955, Email Debra.Norris@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air-to-Air Missiles Program Office (PMA-259), intends to procure, on a full and open competitive basis, AIM-9M Sidewinder Rocket Motors (Mk 36 MOD  11), NSN 1337-01-145-1963, and Inert Rocket Motors (Mk 57 MOD 3), NSN 1338-01-145-1964 to fulfill Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements. The Mk 36 MOD 11 rocket motor is approximately 71 inches long, 5 inches in diameter, and consists of a reduced smoke propellant cast into a steel tube; three hanger attachment lugs, igniter, mechanical arming handle, and nozzle. The inert rocket motor is approximately 71 inches long, 5 inches in diameter, inert material cast into a steel tube; three hanger attachment lugs, igniter, mechanical arming handle and end closure.  The technical data package for the Mk 36 MOD 11 Rocket Motor is classified CONFIDENTIAL.  The resultant contract will contain a base period of one year and four options for FY08 – FY11, which will provide a vehicle for future FMS procurements and United States Navy and Air Force procurements.  Quantities for this contract include all FMS requirements, US Government requirements and any other DoD requirements; estimated quantity is 501 rocket motors for the base year and up to 800 rocket motors for each option year.  Delivery will be required to begin within 16 months from the date of contract award. This acquisition is being pursued as a full and open competition under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(b).  All contractors must meet the Technical Data Package (TDP) requirements, specifically, the First Article Test (FAT), Lot Acceptance Test (LAT), and production acceptance testing / inspections.  In addition, the contractor will require a security clearance adequate to receive and store information classified up to CONFIDENTIAL.  The Government will use full and open competition to fulfill this requirement.  Due, however, to the classified nature of the TDP all bidders will be required to comply with all applicable Defense Security Service provisions of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M), including obtaining Facility Security Clearance to the Confidential level.  Due to the time-sensitivity of the requirement this compliance will be required at the time of the final proposal due date; the Government does not anticipate being able to sponsor any potential bidders in their attempt to obtain this clearance.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year options. Furthermore, it is the Government's intent to award a single contract to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government, cost and non-cost factors considered.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above.  The Government intends to release an electronic RFP on/or about 18 July 2006, with an anticipated closing date of 01 September 2006.  A copy of solicitation N00019-06-R-0062 will be made available on the NAVAIR Home Page at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm.  All potential sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office (PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0024 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  This effort covers the requirements to provide Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209).  The A-10 lacks a robust Line-of-Sight (LOS) secure communications system to fully  integrate with composite combat forces.  An ability to reprogram voice communications in flight provides reliable means of disseminating real-time updates with isolated forces and Command and Control (C2) assets.  Current operations in mountainous and other inhospitable environments are under increasing risk of compromise requiring reduced response times during unconventional air support missions, reduced logistical challenges with sustainment of current equipment and improved interoperable connectivity with communications equipment fielded and used by forces being employed both on the ground and airborne.  The net effect of a secure robust LOS communications capability will be a highly reliable, responsive Close Air Support and Combat Search and Rescue, with lower maintenance enjoyed by materiel improvement.  This effort defines the replacement of the current AN/ARC-186 VHF AM radio with a dual band UHF/VHF radio for a secure LOS capability.  The contractor shall design, fabricate, and deliver a Group A Installation Kit (i.e., unique mounts and any intrinsic wiring/brackets) that are necessary for the installation of a Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications capability.  The Group A and B Kits shall include specialized adapter cables to mate with the existing wiring connectors and the Group B Kit Items (LRU’s).  The contractor shall design the Group A and B Kits such that modification/de-modification time shall be minimized and installation performed by organic field maintenance personnel.  As Rockwell Collins is the sole developer of the ARC-210 Family of products and related ancillary equipment and maintain the proprietary rights to this radio, they are the only capable source of providing the requested changes.  Effort will be performed within 6 months ARO.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France for additional data and biological samples from the IARC’s case-control study in the Golestan Province, Iran. The NEB conducts intramural research in areas related to nutrition and cancer which are aimed at lowering human cancer risk. One focus of NEB research is esophageal cancer, especially in high-risk populations. NEB scientists have performed studies of esophageal cancer in high-risk areas of China for over 15 years. An area of Central Asia from the Caspian Sea to Northwestern China has been identified as the Central Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt because the population throughout this region is at elevated risk of esophageal cancer. The Western edge of this belt is Golestan Province, in Northeastern Iran. This population was studied by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in the 1970s, and IARC has recently re-started studies in this region, including collaborative involvement in a case-control study in Golestan Province. After two years of recruitment in this study, 200 cases and 400 controls have been enrolled. Under purchase order 263-MQ-515640 IARC provided the following service on 100 cases and 200 controls and now they will provide the service on the second 100 cases and second 200 controls.  IARC will: 1) anonymize all data and biological specimens, so they cannot be linked to individuals; 2) provide completed questionnaire data on 100 cases and 200 matched controls collected in Golestan Province, Iran during the prior year; 3) provide pathologic data on all of these subjects who have been endoscopically examined; 4) provide one diagnostic HE-stained tissue section of esophageal cancers found in these subjects; and 5) provide one 2ml serum aliquot and genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells from all of these subjects. This data will aid the NEB in understanding the causes of ESCC in this high-risk population and will allow the NEB to make comparisons between high-risk areas in China and the Central Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt. IARC is the only major research institution conducting a population-based study of esophageal cancer in the Central Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt, and is therefore, the only source for data and biological samples from this area. IARC has a long history of quality research activities, including research in this area of Iran, and the data and samples they collected and are providing are of high quality and will be comparable to data and samples collected by NEB research studies in China and the previous data and samples provided by IARC. The comparison of results from these two area, which are very different geographically, culturally and ethnically, will be a valuable resource for identifying etiologic risk factors for this disease that are important throughout the world. IARC is the only source known to the NCI researcher that can provide the necessary data and biological samples from Golestan Province of the Central Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July  19, 2006. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. Collect calls will not be accepted.

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to deCode Genetics EHF, Sturlugata 8, 101 Reykjavik, Iceland.  The purchase consists of Genome-Wide-Scan at 2cM average resolution using deCode standard STR mapping panel of 93 samples.  As well as Whole Genome Amplification to 40ug final DNA concentration of 93 samples.

As such it has the largest, and most advanced high-throughput microsatellite genotyping facility in the world.  The features and protocols offered by deCode are necessary because mapping of genes is accomplished by the use of multiple markers throughout the genome. The better characterized markers used, the better the chance of finding the correct chromosomes.  An award to any other source would affect the Institute’s anticipated outcome and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the May 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-09.  This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 813212.  

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) working as the coordinating office of the Partners in Information Access to the Public Health Workforce (Partners) to procure professional support services on a sole source basis from the Public Health Foundation (PHF), the national nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve public health infrastructure and performance through research, training, and technical assistance.  NLM plans to provide support to PHF to expand access to public health performance and quality improvement resources, tools, and lessons and to identify, organize, and translate relevant performance improvement information from the private sector and other fields that can be applied/adapted to public health.  Public health organizations at all levels are increasingly being held accountable for defining and achieving measurable standards of performance.  While techniques to analyze, monitor, and improve quality or performance are widely employed in other industries, these techniques are still underutilized in healthcare and are rarely used in public health.  The vendor will: 1) increase access of public health professionals to Quality Improvement (QI) resources from public health and industry; 2) organize and convene two Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice (Council) sessions related to public health systems research (PHSR) at the American Public Health Association (APHA) 134th Annual Meeting; and 3) produce a summary report that provides highlights of the overall project activities and accomplishments.

<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source, to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). NASA/GSFC currently obtains the development and implementation of joint programs in laser ranging and other space geodesy techniques from the SAO. This effort provides for senior system engineering support together with international technical liaison and leadership services for the NASA Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Program. The SAO currently provides these services on Contract NAS5-01113 which is the latest of a succession of sole source contracts for this unique effort. Contract NAS5-01113 expires on October 11, 2006 and another 5 year contract (October 12, 2006 through October 11, 2011) is anticipated. The current contract was awarded to the SAO as a sole-source, noncompetitive procurement. Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) is one of the fundamental techniques for measurement and understanding of plate tectonics, regional crustal deformation, Earth rotation and orientation, the spatial and temporal details of the gravity field, global climate, and in the measurement of fundamental physical constants. SLR also provides the high accuracy, global tracking coverage required for the fullest interpretation of satellite altimetry data for monitoring ocean dynamics and circulation through the details of ocean surface topography.  SLR currently supports satellite missions by generating orbit predictions and collecting tracking data.  The tracking data is used for these satellites’ precise orbit determination that enables sensor calibration and gravity studies to be performed.  The required technical liaison services include maintaining contact with key scientists, government officials and institutions in countries that are or will be involved in SLR activities. The contractor will also oversee daily operations and implementation of procedures, coordination, and management of International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) Central Bureau (CB) activities. The contractor will also need to continue support of the Working Group of European Geoscientists for the Establishment of Networks for Earthquake Research (WEGENER) program and the Asian-Pacific Space Geodynamics (APSG) consortia in an effort to help evolve these two programs. The contractor will further need to provide technical and leadership assistance as required by overseas space geodetic groups and continue to work with the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) Steering Committee and the GGOS Working Group on Ground Networks and Communication to develop and coordinate an integrated global geodetic network.   Such support is needed in order to implement compatible standards, models, and parameters to provide the infrastructural basis for global change research while striving to ensure the stability and ready access of the geometric and gravimetric reference frames through an uninterrupted time series of state-of-the-art global observations. SAO is the only source that has the combined training, experience, and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of operations of international joint programs in laser ranging. Their unequalled knowledge and experience of satellite laser ranging is invaluable to NASA and cannot be obtained from another source.	 This procurement's statement of work calls for a highly skilled international liaison to coordinate ongoing observation programs, plan future observation programs, and seek new interested groups for inclusion in future observation programs. In order to acquire the breadth of understanding held by SAO, prospective companies would need to hire several persons to visit and be trained at the various sites, which would require training for a minimum of one month per SLR system.  The overall training time for an individual would be several years at a very significant cost. Such a task necessitates a unique blend of diplomatic and scientific skills that only the SAO with its international contacts in over 20 countries and demonstrated acceptance by the European, Asian, and Russian engineering analysis and scientific geodynamics community possesses. SAO also has 40 years of experience in Satellite Laser Ranging, developing instrumentation, deployment of field systems, and analysis and interpretation of data. Any attempt by another contractor to establish international liaisons and gain a broad technical understanding of numerous SLR systems in the international community represents a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in the daily operations of ongoing programs in the ILRS and NASA SLR network.” Any other persons desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 18, 2006.Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAVAIR intends to award Multiple Orders on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of avionics systems engineering, software engineering, trainer systems engineering, and life cycle support engineering for V-22 avionics, avionics software, ground stations (V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS) and Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS)), V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS), V-22 training products (Avionics Functional V-22 Trainer (AFVT) and Trainer Fault Insertion System (TFIS)), V-22 facilities, V-22 simulation software, and components of the V-22 Desktop Test Environment (DTE) software. This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, software, facilities, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007. RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting scheduling and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Development Avionics Systems Engineering. RTSC will continue to provide developmental engineering, Configuration Management (CM), Data Management (DM) services, and logistics support for Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC), engine and aircraft health monitoring systems (Vibration, Structural Life, and Engine Diagnostics (VSLED)), Drive System Interface Unit (DSIU), Ice Protection System (IPS), Wing Fire Protection Controller (WFPC), Fuel Management System (FMS), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and Digital Map System (DMS) navigation systems, and the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) and the Suite of Integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasures (SIRFC), and a Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) for low altitude "nap of the earth" flying. Engineers are shared between V-22 development and Software Support Activity (SSA) so that the same engineer that is working on the latest V-22 avionics development is also working to solve V-22 fleet issues and recommending fleet enhancements. RTSC engineers also provide extensive inputs into avionics development, integration, and production by working on V-22 avionics Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the prime contractor (Bell-Boeing), avionics suppliers, and the government. RTSC is the government's designated representative to perform Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application System Software (JASS). 

(B) V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) and Software Development. RTSC will continue to provide avionics systems and software engineering to resolve post-production issues and develop enhancements for autopilot (a.k.a. Flight Director), navigation, control of communication systems, aircraft & engine health monitoring, mission management and mission planning correlation, sensors & EW management, and reporting and management of various other subsystems. 

(C) V-22 Aircraft Training Products and Upgrades. RTSC will continue to provide the engineering, technical support and phased upgrades for Avionics Functional V-22 Trainer (AFVT) & Trainer Fault Insertion System (TFIS) trainers that they designed and manufactured, which are now installed at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, NC. The AFVT is an avionics system maintenance trainer that utilizes several avionics software simulation products developed, used, and maintained by other RTSC engineering teams. The TFIS inserts faults into a ground based maintenance training aircraft, and production of one additional TFIS system is anticipated. 

(D) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS). The VMPS is comprised of two Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs) and three hardware configuration items procured under a multi-year phased developmental effort with RTSC initiated in 2001 and under continuing development and support. The VMPS CSCIs are the Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), which is the software framework that is used as a basis for VMPS, and the V-22 Unique Planning Component (UPC) that implements V-22 unique mission planning functionality. 

(E) V-22 Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS) and Collaborative Automated Maintenance Environment for Osprey (CAMEO). AMEGS is a ground station system that collects maintenance, vibration, failure, and engine data from the aircraft and helps maintainers to maintain the aircraft. RTSC designed, developed, and produced the AMEGS, and continues to implement new functionality, including an interface to Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS). RTSC will continue to provide design, development, integration and support for the AMEGS including the development of an AMEGS variant that will interface with Air Force maintenance and parts life tracking databases. 

(F) V-22 RTSC Unique Products and services. RTSC will continue to provide: Multi-Mode Radar (MMR), APX-119 Identify Friend or Foe (IFF), Forward-Looking Infra-Red (FLIR), and Miniaturized Global Positioning System 2000 (MAGR-2000) GPS receiver. Although the procuring activity for the aforementioned equipment will be the primary source for related technical services, in compelling circumstances this contract may be utilized as an adjunct vehicle to procure efforts such as ECPs, EI's, etc. when conducted by the RTSC facilities that produce these systems. 

(G) V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS) Development and Production. The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC. It is a system that will connect to the Troop Commander Panel provided in the V-22 passenger cabin, and will provide situational awareness data to passengers. The VISAS uses simulation software products developed by RTSC. This is an ongoing project that has been in development for six years, and will continue to be updated during the MV-22 Block C and CV-22 Block 20 developments. The initial version of VISAS is required for CV-22 IOT&E in October 2007. 

(H) Facilities and Software Simulation Products. The main avionics facility that is used by all RTSC Indianapolis projects is the VAIL. RTSC will continue to expand the VAIL capabilities as new hardware is received to support the SSA. RTSC has also developed a portable, flyable hardware and software testing system called Roll-On/Roll-Off (RORO). This testing system will be used for avionics technology demonstrations on V-22 test aircraft. Software Simulation Products include V-22 Dynamic Display System (VDDS), Simulation Control (SIMCNTRL), JSSS-Automated Test Tool (JSSS-ATT), Virtual Emulated Mission Data Loader (VEMDL) and Bus Controller Tool (BC-Tool).

<DESC><B>Pre-Solicitation Notice :</B>
<P>

<P>
Advance notice of this project has been previously published at FedBizOpps through the posting of draft solicitation documents, inclusive of a draft Statement of Work and responses to contractor submitted requests for clarification. These documents were posted using Reference-Number-SSA-TSRP-(VOIP)-2006, and can be accessed at: <U>http://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference%2DNumber%2DSSA%2DTSRP%2D%28VOIP%29%2D2006/Synopsis.html</U>. Interested parties are encouraged to access these previous draft postings to familiarize themselves with the general requirements of the SSA under TSRP. Interested parties are, however, advised that the requirements that will be contained in the final RFP may differ from those previously released in draft form.
<P>
Interested parties are notified that the Interested Vendor List (IVL) functionality of the FedBizOpps website has been activated and are encouraged to use this and other means to identify and contact other potential teaming partners for this procurement. 
<P>
This notice is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for information.

Any information received in response to this notice will not be considered, and will be discarded.
<P>
<B>Synopsis of Requirements :</B>
<P>
The Social Security Administration (SSA) will replace its current Private Branch eXchange (PBX) telephony systems at specified sites with an Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony solution, to support current and future requirements and the transition to Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony, hereafter known as the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TRSP). The SSA’s current PBX systems have limitations that impact productivity, efficiency, and cost in completing the Agency’s mission.  In addition, there are concerns about the technical support for the existing PBX systems.  The target Enterprise VoIP architecture for the replacement system will utilize centralized call processing equipment located on Agency premises and several premise based systems, employing an Agency-provided data network infrastructure for transport.  This VoIP system architecture will provide greater functionality, interoperability, flexibility, survivability and a consolidated operational and management infrastructure.  It will be a robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure that will provide significant business value in the near term, and will best position the Agency for the future.  The solution will deliver a single logical system that will provide telephone, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Automated Attendant (AA), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and voicemail services across Agency’s Headquarters and Field Office organizations, including 10 regional offices, 6 Program Service Centers, and over 1500 Field Offices, to name a few.  
<P>
The TSRP solution will consist of contractor provided hardware, software, and professional services to install and integrate the TSRP solution with the SSA’s GFE, and remove the end of life telephony systems.  The GFE include the Agency’s Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) network infrastructure, and WAN and PSTN transport facilities and services. The Contractor will provide a migration path from the existing key system voice platform to support telephony and other voice communication sessions among people who are geographically dispersed though an innovative, comprehensive solution that combines, voice, video, and data applications on the Agency’s existing data network infrastructure. TSRP will also include a Contractor provided “Managed Services” component for addressing the management, control, administration and maintenance of the enterprise VoIP solution.  These services will entail close cooperation with the Agency’s current Information Technology (IT) groups, as well as the Agency’s GFE and provider(s).  
<P>
The upcoming TSRP solicitation will fully specify the following contractor provided supplies and services:
<P>
1.	Connectivity between hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment.
<P>
2.	A single logical telephony system for the Agency’s existing Field Offices. 
<P>
3.	Multiple single site telephony systems for some of the Agency’s large sites and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
<P>
4.	Specifications required to engineer, furnish, integrate, install, test, and place in service (cutover) the TSRP solution, as well as support of the System equipment.
<P>
5.	Training of government personnel.
<P>
6.	Ongoing on-site maintenance and management with trained and certified individuals.
<P>
7.	Removal and disposal of obsolete telephony equipment from the Agency’s offices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS OF ANY KIND FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

The United States Government Printing Office’s (GPO) core mission, Keeping America Informed, dates to 1813 when Congress determined the need to make information regarding the work of the three branches of government available to all Americans.  This is an inherent function of government which GPO carries out for Federal agencies on behalf of the public.  The GPO is the Federal government’s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing and preserving published information in all its forms.  GPO's authority is codified in the public printing and documents chapters of Title 44, United States Code.
Since its inception, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services to enable them to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents according to a uniform set of Federal government specifications.  In addition, GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available at no cost through the Federal Depository Library Program.
Today, the GPO is at the epicenter of technological change as it embraces its historic mission while looking to the digital future.  Today, many documents no longer require typesetting, printing, or binding and there is no tangible document to make its way to library shelves or to be preserved for the future.  This evolution of document creation and dissemination has provided GPO with a significant challenge to its future relevance and viability.  GPO is meeting this challenge by transforming into an entity capable of delivering Federal information products and services from a flexible digital platform. 
While the introduction of digital technology may change the way GPO’s products and services will be created and how they will look and function, GPO will continue to satisfy the Government’s changing information requirements, and accomplish its mission of Keeping America Informed.  Please visit www.gpo.gov for more information.

The GPO Office of Inspector General (OIG) provides leadership and coordination, recommends policies to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement, and promotes economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in GPO's programs and operations. The OIG offers an independent and objective means of keeping the Public Printer and the Congress fully informed about problems and deficiencies relating to the administration and operations of the GPO. To meet these responsibilities, in part, the OIG conducts independent audits and assessments of the management of GPO’s information technology (IT) operations and resources.  The OIG periodically enlists the expertise and services of third-party entities for certain IT-related audits and assessments and is now conducting market research to assess the qualifications and capabilities of available and interested vendors.

During the course of the next several years, the OIG will require the services of an organization(s) that can respond quickly to a broad range of independent IT audit and assessment needs.  These needs include, but are not limited to:  

•	Full life-cycle independent verification and validation (IV&V).
•	Audits and assessments of:
-  Network vulnerabilities (to include penetration testing).
-  Web server and application security.
-  Public Key Infrastructure. 
-  Physical and logical access and identity management systems.
-  Security and intelligent document production and distribution.
-  IT acquisitions.

All contractor personnel assigned to an IT-related audit or assessment at GPO must have, at a minimum, a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) that has been favorably adjudicated by an appropriate government authority.  

IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE, ALL INTERESTED PARTIES must provide a capabilities statement which demonstrates their ability to provide the services described above, as well as a statement of relevant experience providing the services to other Federal government organizations.  This sources sought synopsis is not a Request for Proposal; it is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought request.  All documentation submitted shall become the property of the Government.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  A written capabilities statement, including a statement of related experience in Federal government organizations and other supporting documentation, shall be submitted to and received by:

The contract is a five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract for research and development related to electronics and communication equipment.  NSWC Crane has an existing requirement for testing and logistics support related to equipment being developed and delivered by Coherent Systems.  This requirement is anticipated to be 18 months in duration.  The Government plans to meet this existing requirement by modifying existing contract N00164-04-D-6636 to add this to the scope of the contract and issue a task order against the contract to allow Coherent to perform the work. Other than full and open competition procedures will be utilized with Coherent Systems in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source for these services because the requirement is a follow-on effort to work being performed by Coherent Systems under the existing contract.   No solicitation will be issued.  The POC is Mr. J.D. Martin, Code 0564EF, telephone 812-854-3723, or email:  James.D.Martin@navy.mil.  NAICS Code 541710; PSC Class AC60.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information under FAR 10.002(b) and 15.201 (e):  Provide professional and non-professional personnel to support Family Services Programs.
<DESC>The following is a Request for Information (RFI).  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).  A draft of the RFP will be released in conjunction with this notice.  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry comment, identify potential problem areas, and obtain alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these services.  The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.   Responses should be received by July 24, 2006. The requirement is to provide a variety of professional and non-professional personnel to support Marine and Family Services (M&FS) branches, located at multiple Marine Corps installations in California and Hawaii.  M&FS provide counseling, victim advocacy, educational assistance, and variety of other programs for military personnel and their family members.  The Government currently is contemplating a partial small business set-aside for these services. Comments are solicited regarding the following items:  1)  Are the classes of services requested under the draft RFP appropriately combined.  2)  Are the quantities of services that are set-aside for small business (all locations except Camp Pendleton) beyond the capability of small business firms; when the limitation on sub-contracting is considered.  3)  Are the negative incentives in the draft Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) reasonable.  4)  Are the sub-contracting goals (for large business) obtainable. Any comments provided should not be viewed as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  Replies will be separated from, and having no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting RFP.  The Government will not critique comments and the Government will not pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI.

<SUBJECT>66 -- BAS-5000 Imaging Plate Scanner System
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with FUJIFilm Life Science USA, for the acquisition of one (1) BAS-5000 Imaging Plate Scanner, part number YBBAS5000 and one (1) FLA-5000 Imaging Plate Eraser,  Part Number YBIPEFLA5000, one (1) Image Reader Software for Windows, Part Number YBIRWINOSAO5, one (1) Dell GX270 Workstation for SSG with software cables and manuals.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for compatibility.     BAS-5000 with controller that will daisy-chain with preexisting BAS-5000 for full comparability and maintenance equivalency.  Resolution and sensitivity must equal that of preexisting BAS-5000 function and results prior to 2003 on a windows platform.
 After evaluating 4 other digital autoradiograp systems, and nuclear film, none of them could meet the specifications.  All of the other evaluated units failed in the ability to discriminate 10mBq levels of different beta particle energies within the energy range of interest, all of them failed to produce characteristic background spectra, some of them failed to discriminate alpha from beta sources at the mBq level, film is not adequately sensitive and linear and required chemical work.  

Specifications

•	All specifications must be met within one month of delivery to NIST.
•	The instrument must produce autoradiographs of radionuclide sources.
•	The autoradiographs must be possible for samples that are 20 cm x 25 cm in size without having to make two exposures or two scans.
•	The specifications listed shall be achieved with a digital imaging system having a pixel size that is 25 ìm or smaller.
•	The FWHM1 of peaks in profiles of non-transposed2 image data must be no greater than 60 ìm per single beta particle recorded for the beta energy range of 0 keV to 520 keV.
•	The FWHM1 of peaks in profiles of non-transposed2 image data must be no greater than 80 ìm per single alpha particle recorded for the alpha energy range of 0 keV to 2 MeV.
•	Pixel intensity data shall be linear with respect to x-ray dose and with respect to 14C activity levels over five orders of magnitude.
•	Spatial homogeneity:  Ambient background exposures resulting in a single image must be possible over at least 500 cm2 with the following additional requirement:  No 150 cm2 area in the resulting single background image may deviate more than 10% in mean pixel value from any other 150 cm2 area on that same background image.
•	Reproducibility:  (1) Alpha particles of a specific energy shall produce a Sig value4 that does not vary by more than 30% from one alpha particle to the next.  (2)  When running NIST code version 39 developed for the preexisting BAS-5000, the background spectra of Sig values produced4 shall have a peak at 300-500 Sig for 2 hour vertical ambient unshielded background exposures in our laboratory, and a peak at 1200-1400 Sig4
•	Radionuclide discrimination:  The following activity sources must be distinguishable from each other based on spectrally-separated Sig value modes4 of within 20% of Sig =  400 for background, 900 for 3H, 1000 for 40K, 1100 for 137Cs, 1300 for 60Co, 1350 for 14C and > 2000 for alpha counts.  A systematic shift in all values will be acceptable as long as these radionuclides can be distinguished at the 10mBq level.
•	System noise discrimination:  Spurious non-radioactivity sources of signals shall have the distinguishing characteristic of being one pixel in size in one dimension and 1 to 10 pixels wide in the orthogonal direction.
•	Sensitivity: The system shall be capable of detecting and locating 10 mBq beta sources and micro-Bq level alpha sources with a spatial precision of 0.5 mm and a positional accuracy of 2 mm.
•	Diagnostic software capable of fine-tuning the black level and gain of the secondary detector (scanner) shall be provided and shall operate on the controller.
•	The controller system must be fully compatible with the NIST Windows-based LAN.
•	Throughput:  The system must be capable of performing multi-week well-shielded exposures in parallel (e.g. eight individual 20 cm x 25 cm plates must be well-shielded and in use simultaneously).
•	The system must not require wet or gel-based chemical handling or a darkroom to meet the specifications.
•	The system must utilize approximately 10 preexisting 20 cm x 25 cm tritium-detectable primary detectors (Fujifilm TR2025 imaging plates) that meet all of the specifications above while doing so. 

1.	FWHM = full width of peak at the half-maximum height of the peak.
2.	The ADC conversion from the voltage from luminescence measurement device (such as a PMT) shall be converted to 16 bit deep pixel values without application of mathematical transforms.  In other words, the data must be raw and not available only in PSL or similar units.
3.	The secondary detector is the phosphor plate scanner, whereas the primary detector is the phosphor plate itself.
4.	The Sig value is produced by NIST custom code developed with the preexisting BAS-5000, and is the pixel intensity sum over a 0.01 mm2 area centered on the recorded alpha particle, beta particle, or discrete background count.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423450, and the size standard is 100 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.     However, responses received by July 10, 2006 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  This requirement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541511 (formerly SIC code 7371).  

The offerors shall provide separate pricing for each of the contract line item numbers (CLINs):  0001 - Contractor shall provide all professional services in accordance with the Statement of Objectives (SOO); 0001AA - Direct Labor Costs; 0001AB - Other Direct Costs.   

Statement Of Objectives (SOO) for Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems (DoDIIS) Content Management Data Layer (Physical), dated April 22, 2006   

1. INTRODUCTION:  The DoDIIS Physical Data Layer (PDL) is the implementation of a defense intelligence Enterprise structured data layer that covers the final development of the DoDIIS Data Reference Model (DRM), and the establishment of an enterprise Content Management (CM) architecture that adheres to DoD/Net-Centric architectural compliance and interoperable data retrieval and production into a compliant DoDIIS data repository.  Physical data and content management is vital for information sharing, as valuable data is often stored in documents and other files that are not easily accessible on the network. Currently, no DoDIIS enterprise level physical data/content management (CM) strategy exists. 

The basis of the DoDIIS PDL is to provide a standards-based, service-oriented architecture that will enable the following capabilities across the DoDIIS data landscape:
Data Visibility, Data Accessibility and Data Trustworthiness.

The goal of this task is to establish an enterprise Data Reference Model (DRM) and a physical content management system that is enabled via the DODIIS Data Layer (DDL). By aligning the enterprise DRM and Enterprise Content Management (ECM) implementation with the DDL, formerly inaccessible documents and artifacts will be seamlessly integrated and available to the analyst.  Furthermore, an enterprise content management system will allow documents to be managed throughout their lifecycle, from authoring through dissemination and revocation.

1.1 Project Objective

Provide Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Directorate of Information Management (DS) with a Physical Data Layer and content management technical architecture and a prototype implementation that will position the DoDIIS Data Architecture to establish an Enterprise-level physical data layer integrated with the Enterprise-level logical data layer (DoDIIS DDL) to improve intelligence data sharing and management across the Intelligence Community and Department of Defense in support of National Security. The architecture and prototype should establish an enterprise content management system that is integrated with the enterprise logical data layer (i.e., DDL) and position the DoDIIS Information Data Architecture (DIDA) such that it can quickly and effectively integrate, expose, and control new data sources

1.2 Scope and Constraints 

This period of performance for this contract shall run from the contract award date for two years. The purpose of this task is to design and deliver an Enterprise DoDIIS Physical Data Layer, which will encompass a data reference model, an enterprise content management strategy and architecture, and deliver an enterprise content management prototype complete with detailed implementation specifications for full-scale enterprise deployment.

 The DoDIIS PDL will include the integration of commercial, Federal, and Department of Defense (DoD) technical standards within a common business framework and per Community Management Staff direction, and in line with emerging Executive Orders.  In addition, this task includes the integration of all applicable commercial, Federal, and DoD technical standards within a common domain data reference model to establish a standard DoDIIS approach to developing, integrating, sharing, and maintaining the baseline DoDIIS PDL.

1.3 Background 

The volume and types of data maintained across the defense intelligence community, is extremely large, and physically located on servers at local, regional, and Enterprise installations. The DoDIIS Enteprise Content Management Strategy is to create a data layer to allow access to data independently of the application in a Service Oriented Architecture environment.  The core components include a logical data layer (DDL) {outside the scope of this contract} and a physical data layer, which will  create a virtual document repository that allows information to be created, managed, accessed, and destroyed in an orderly, timely, and predictable manner

The DoDIIS Physical Data Layer (PDL) must address a broad selected set of capabilities that have been identified in the Intelligence Community System for Information Sharing (ICSIS) architecture and the DoDs’ Global Information Grid (GIG) architecture, and must fully integrate with the emerging DoDIIS Data Layer. The PDL must also leverage existing and on-going CM tasks and deliverables.

2. TECHNICAL TASKS AND REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall perform the following tasks in support of the DoDIIS Physical Data Layer Strategy and Prototype:

Task 2.1 – DoDIIS Data Reference Model (DRM)
The DoDIIS Data Reference Model will consist of fully documented standards with sufficient detail for deployment and usage across the DoDIIS Enterprise.  The DoDIIS DRM will consist of a comprehensive Enterprise Content Management strategy for managing content generated and controlled by DoDIIS.  The strategy shall address the full lifecycle of information within DoDIIS, consider strategic and tactical intelligence, as well as raw and finished intelligence The DoDIIS DRM must be compatible and ensure interoperability with the Intelligence Community and Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).  The DRM will encompass the following sub-tasks:
   - Leverage the deliverables from the preceding Content Management tasks, to:      
      -- Establish an approach to the categorization of data representing the general business purpose of the data using the FEA Business Reference Model (BRM) as its categorization taxonomy.
      --Establish the exchange of data via a standard message structure.  The information exchange package represents an actual set of data that is requested or produced from one unit of work to another. The information exchange package makes use of the DRM (s) ability to both categorize and structure data.

      --Establish the structure of data via data element represents information about a particular thing, and can be presented in many formats. The data element is aligned with the business context, so that users of an agency’s data understand the data’s purpose and context.  

      --Establish enterprise level content management standards that can be applied across DoDIIS and provide information interoperability.  The standards must comply with existing Intelligence Community (IC) and Federal standards (e.g., DoD 5015), and also address emerging standards as necessary.

 The deliverables will be completed via a 2-step formal coordination process.  

In support of the DoDIIS DRM, represent DoDIIS in various data standards bodies.
    A.  Represent DoDIIS in IC and DoD standards bodies.
    B.  Oversee DoDIIS change requests and updates.
    C. Work with DoDIIS Way Ahead and EEG’s, especially Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

Statement of Work For Near Space Vehicle Platform Research  and Analysis. The Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDBL) located in Colorado Springs has a requirement for Near Space Vehicle Platform research and analysis. The Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows: Period of Performance: 1 year after date of awar d of contract.  Deliverables: Written Final Report submitted to the SMDBL no later than 1 year after date of award of the contract, plus provide oral presentations on progress to be scheduled approximately every 30 days. Technical tasks to be performed: 1.  In conjunction with the SMDBL, candidate will select up to three near-space vehicle platform configurations for further analysis, either under this SOW, or under anticipated follow-on investigation. The three configurations shall be: #1 Cigar shape (simil ar to the proposed High Altitude Airship (HAA), #2 Hybrid lifting, and #3 Powered (heavier than air). These configurations are intended to be generic representations of different classes of vehicles. 2. A preliminary analysis will be performed under this s tudy of at least one of the chosen platform geometries, for the purpose of assessing the flight performance of the particular type (e.g., geometry) vehicle investigated. For the purpose of this study, flight performance will be defined in terms of time on station at 65,000 ft altitude, or above, in the presence of winds and atmospheric turbulence. 3. To support the above performance assessments, the aerodynamic characteristics affecting this performance of the selected vehicle geometries will be estimated ( also see Task 6 below). 4. Atmospheric data will be collected to support the performance analysis cited in Task 2 above. Data collection and compilation will be  performed of existing atmospheric turbulence data and mean winds for altitudes above 65,000 feet, corresponding to up to three geographical locations to be selected by SMDBL. (This location(s) within CONUS) 5. A systems analysis of the available energy, a nd estimates of propulsive thrust or power available for the near-space vehicle geometries being analyzed would be performed in support of the performance assessment cited in Task 2 above. Factors to be consi dered would include propulsion efficiencies, pa yload energy requirements, environmental maintenance requirements, energy generation and storage rates and efficiencies, altitude and station-keeping specifications. 6. Where aerodynamic data (Task 3), atmospheric data (Task 4), and/or energy and propulsiv e efficiencies (Task 5) are available from SMDBL, that data will be evaluated by candidate and used as appropriate. No experimental efforts are anticipated under this study for the generation of these data. 7. Based on the results of the investigations lis ted above, additional studies of particular importance or relevance will be identified and recommended. These additional studies might be undertaken as a follow-on to this study, or suggested as augmentations to this study, performed in parallel.

Each pulpit ladder has as its base rigid guide rollers on the sides of the four corners, which roll along the 42-inch wide shelving base closures, 2-inches above the floor surface, for smooth movement of the ladder in order not to bump and damage the shelved records.  All shelving base closures must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the shelving unit, at both ends.  The units will not become dislodged by the four guide rollers of the aluminum pulpit ladders during their movement in the aisles while servicing the stored records, or by common impact forces within the storage space.
