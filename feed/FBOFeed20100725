<a href="mailto:michael.vallone@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Expert Consults, Morgantown, WV, on a sole source basis, a non-personal service contract to provide/perform Pulmonary Toxicity Testing. The contract will be for a base year plus one option year.  Similar services in a study were conducted in 2008-2009. The original testing produced unexpected results that were different from results obtained with testing using other particulate matter collected. To verify the observed toxicity, a second study must be performed using a second sample of particulate matter collect.  Competition for this requirement and awarding to any other source would compromise the science, resulting in possible delays and could also increase the overall cost to the Government. This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. After the publication of this announcement for fifteen (15)  days, solicitation W81XWH-10-T-0409 will be posted for five (days). The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is: michael.vallone@amedd.army.mil.

The<br />award will be made to the offeror whose proposal conforms<br />to the terms and conditions of the solicitation and<br />represents the best value to the Government. Therefore,<br />award may be made to other than the lowest priced or the<br />highest technically rated offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE AND TRADE-OFFS.&nbsp; The<br />Government will base the determination of best value on<br />a comparative assessment of the offerors' prices, past<br />performance, and the other evaluation factors identified<br />elsewhere in this solicitation.&nbsp; The determination of best<br />value also considers the relative importance of the<br />evaluation factors.&nbsp; All evaluation factors, when<br />combined, are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ]&nbsp; significantly more important than cost<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or price.&nbsp; As other evaluation factors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become more equal, the evaluated cost or<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; price becomes more important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X]&nbsp; approximately equal to cost or price; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ]&nbsp; significantly less important than cost<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or price.&nbsp; As the evaluated cost/price<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; becomes more equal, relative importance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all other evaluation factors becomes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more significant.</p>
<p>The final award decision may involve a trade-off among<br />cost or price and the non-price factors.&nbsp; Factors that may<br />be considered in the trade-off process include, but are not<br />limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Item criticality and weapons system application<br />&nbsp; Current inventory status<br />&nbsp; Historical delivery or quality problems<br />&nbsp; Concerns over limited supply sources and industrial base<br />&nbsp; Benefits from obtaining new sources</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; COST OR PRICE.&nbsp; The Government will evaluate the<br />offered cost or price for cost realism, as defined in FAR<br />15.401, and reasonableness.&nbsp; The Government will add any<br />other cost or price evaluation factors identified elsewhere<br />in this solicitation (e.g. Buy American Act or FOB Origin<br />transportation costs) to arrive at the offeror's evaluated<br />cost or price.&nbsp; The evaluated cost or price will be used in<br />conjunction with the other non-price factors to determine<br />the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; PAST PERFORMANCE.&nbsp; Past performance includes,<br />but is not limited to, the offeror's record of conforming<br />to contract requirements and standards of good workmanship;<br />adherence to contract schedules, including the<br />administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's<br />reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and<br />commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally,<br />the offeror's business-like concern for the customer's<br />interest.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; The Automated Best Value System (ABVS) or the Past<br />Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical<br />Reporting (PPIRS-SR), as applicable, will be used to evaluate<br />quality and past performance on DLA awards (see 52.215-9022).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; In addition, offerors may submit with their offer<br />information on past and current Federal (non-DSCR), State<br />and local government and private sector contracts performed<br />by the offeror at the proposed performance location within<br />the last three years that are similar in nature to this<br />acquisition.&nbsp; Offerors electing to submit this data must<br />furnish at least the following information: name and address<br />of the contracting entity; the contract number; award and<br />completion dates; the dollar value; the contract type; the<br />items or services provided; two references, with title and<br />phone number; and any problems encountered and the<br />corrective action taken by the offeror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; By submitting past performance information,<br />the offeror agrees to permit the Government's<br />representatives to contact the listed references and<br />inquire of the offeror's performance.&nbsp; If more than three<br />contracts are identified, the Government reserves the right<br />to randomly select and limit its review to three contracts.<br />In addition to the information provided, the Government<br />may consider information obtained from other sources when<br />evaluating the offeror's past performance.&nbsp; Offerors will be<br />given the opportunity to discuss negative past performance<br />information obtained from references if the offeror has not<br />had a previous opportunity to comment on that information.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; Offerors with no past performance history<br />(whether internal or external to the Federal government)<br />will not be evaluated favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FACTORS.&nbsp; The<br />Government will use the past performance evaluation<br />factors marked below in addition to cost or price and other<br />evaluation factors specified in the solicitation.&nbsp; Unless<br />indicated otherwise, past performance is significantly more<br />important than other non-price factors.&nbsp; Within the past<br />performance subfactors, ABVS scores/PPIRS assessments (as<br />applicable) will be weighed most heavily.&nbsp; Historical quality<br />history and delivery schedule compliance (not captured in<br />ABVS/PPIRS) will be weighed more heavily than the remaining<br />past performance subfactors.&nbsp; All other non-price evaluation<br />factors specified in this solicitation weigh equally, unless<br />otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X]&nbsp; ABVS Score/PPIRS-SR Assessments<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (52.215-9022)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ]&nbsp; PPIRS-RC Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ]&nbsp; Historical Quality (not captured in ABVS/PPIRS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ]&nbsp; Historical Delivery Schedule Compliance (not<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; captured in ABVS/PPIRS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X]&nbsp; ABILITYONE (52.215-9005)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X]&nbsp; Mentoring Business Agreements (MBA)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (52.219-9003)</p>
