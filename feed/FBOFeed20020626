<DESC>The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is seeking a qualified firm or organization to provide architect-engineer (A/E) services for the planning and design of a new interpretive and visitors' center at the Normandy American Cemetery in France, pursuant to Public Law 107-73.

The Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944 was one of the most extraordinary events of the 20th century, in that it was not only a tremendous feat of military planning and strategy, but also a pivotal moment in World War II, and for determining the future of Europe and world history.  The Normandy American Cemetery is itself a beautiful and fitting monument to those who fought and died on Utah and Omaha Beach, and is sited on land where significant parts of the D-Day battle occurred.  As such, PL 107-73 directs that ABMC 'ensure that the placement, scope and character of this new center protect the solemnity of the site and the sensitivity of interested parties including families of servicemen interred at the cemetery, the host country and Allied Forces who participated in the ensuing battle.'  The Normandy American Cemetery is one of fourteen permanent American World War II military cemeteries constructed on foreign soil by the ABMC, and is approximately 172 acres in size.  Architects for the cemetery's memorial features were Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson; the landscape architect was Markley Stevenson.  Over 9,000 of America's Honored War Dead are at rest in the cemetery.

In addition to full design services, the tentative scope of work required may include the following: project management, programming, site surveying and analysis; geo-technical studies; utilities surveys, existing facility surveying, traffic analysis (macro); visitor traffic and circulation analyses; environmental assessment, cost control/estimating, value engineering, energy/life-cycle analyses, and other technical studies; conceptual, schematic, and preliminary design; construction documents, plans & specifications, bid documents, and as-built drawings; construction management and/or supplemental services; and, code compliance review and assurance (French, American, European Union).  All work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Code compliance will be the most stringent of those previously mentioned.  Professional disciplines and other consulting services required will include but are not limited to: architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering, electrical engineering, acoustical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, lighting design, interior design, media, exhibit, content development and historical verification, staffing analysis, commissioning, and security assessment.  Incidental services may include CADD drafting, 3-D modeling, GIS, word-processing, spreadsheet preparation and database management.  In summary, the A/E selected will assist or perform all services necessary to determine the messages and media appropriate to convey the historical significance and meaning of the Normandy invasion; and, to plan, program, and design the center.  This project (and the selected A/E's eventual contract) will be structured in four phases: programming, design, construction, and post-construction.  ABMC's Headquarters (Washington, DC) and the European Regional Office (Garches, France) will direct and manage the A/E's efforts; primary control and direction will transition to the European Regional Office after programming has been finalized (or sooner depending on progress during that phase).  As such, the A/E must have a dual capability regarding coordination and project management.  The A/E must have a European corporate office within or adjacent to the host country (France) which is capable of response to and coordination with ABMC's European Regional Director and staff, and also assisting with obtaining necessary agreement and authorization from French authorities regarding design and construction issues.  The A/E must also have a corporate office within the Washington DC Metropolitan area capable of the same management support, program development and coordination.  Any and all travel to either location necessary for project management and/or overall project oversight will be considered as local travel.  All construction and construction-related documents must conform to host country (France) requirements and regulations (to include but not limited to registration and stamping). 

Information regarding the Normandy American Cemetery may be obtained by letter or fax request to the contracting office (telephone requests will not be processed).  Information may also be obtained via ABMC's website - www.abmc.gov.

Evaluation Criteria: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of ABMC personnel and other Federal agency personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: (1) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract, particularly that related to the programming and/or design of interpretive and/or visitor facilities; (2) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private sector entities in terms of quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, and cost control; (3) Professional qualifications of individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses and experience in the work proposed; (4) Project coordination and management capabilities, especially as related to the experience of proposed key personnel, and the ability to effectively communicate, coordinate, and facilitate work with ABMC expeditiously and to participate in related meetings with Federal agencies, private-sector experts, and foreign officials.

The selection process will conform to FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms meeting the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit a complete Standard Form 255, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project; a current and complete Standard Form 254, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire; and, a current and complete Standard Form 254 for each consultant and/or subcontractor.  The following supplemental information must also accompany the SF 255/SF 254's: (1) A statement which addresses the 'technical' and 'management' key personnel regarding their experience working together, as well as how the team will be structured.  (2) Resumes of key personnel. (3) A statement which addresses experience in significant similar projects by the firm and/or any proposed team members.  Similar projects are those which focused on the programming or and/or design of an interpretive or visitors' center, or a facility which is similar in function.  Information should be provided regarding any such projects (e.g., owner's name and address, references, design and construction costs, period of performance, etc.).   A cover or transmittal letter and/or supplemental statement addressing how the firm's qualifications relate to the evaluation criteria may also be submitted.  The required forms and information (one original and five copies of each) must be submitted on or before 4 p.m. on August 1, 2002.  This is not a request for proposal.  This is not a Small Business Set Aside.

<CONTACT>Susan Benik, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1350
<DESC>B--The Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to award a small business set-aside contract for GovWorks advertising and marketing services.  The NAICS Code is 541810 - Advertising Agencies. Contractors must be currently listed with the Small Business Administration (SBA) via a Pro-Net Number in the NAICS Code specified.  This requirement is for GovWorks, a fee-for-service, federal acquisition provider within the Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service.  The period of performance for this effort is for a one-year base contract (estimated start date 01 October 2002) with two one-year options.  GovWorks is a federal acquisition service that provides procurement services to all Civilian Agencies and the Department of Defense on a fee-for-service basis.  As a "Franchise Fund," GovWorks was founded in 1996 as part of the Government Management Reform Act.  GovWorks' mandate is to apply "private-sector" business operating principals to our operating model in order to improve Federal procurement buying - bringing speed and efficiency to an otherwise slow and often cumbersome process.  GovWorks' demonstration of such need is reflected in our growth; today, GovWorks' revenues are approaching $500 million.  For GovWorks to continue and build its federal government client base, we must continue to create "top-of-mind awareness" with the target audiences at the project manager/project officer level.  Tactically we use IMC (Integrated Marketing Communications) as a strategy to push the GovWorks brand via Advertising, Promotion, Direct Mail, Public Relations, and e-Media.  The 2001-02 fiscal budget totaled $1.3 million.  GovWorks is seeking a marketing/advertising firm to assist the in-house marketing communications and business development team with strategic planning, brand building initiatives, media placement, promotional venues, and electronic business initiatives.  The preferred contractor will (1) have a successful track record of Integrated Marketing Communications in the business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-government (B2G) service space, (2) be able to demonstrate exceptional creative talent in the design and execution of marketing programs supporting service industry business initiatives, (3) have a history of successful e-media deployments in this same arena, and (4) be able to verify unique account service attributes through past performance evaluations.  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing by 4:00PM EST, 18 July 2002, a Capabilities Statement detailing:  (1)  Organizational Experience and Facilities Describe the experience and capability of your organization in conducting similar marketing and advertising work.  Include samples/examples of strategic market planning, creative executions (with copy) for specific business initiatives, promotional support in the conference or trade shows arena, and e-media products.  Provide a description of the facilities and any equipment or assets related to this work.  Detail account, creative, production, and management team organizations with a brief description of workflow or inter-agency process models.  (2)  Key Personnel and Successes  Provide a description of the experience and capability for each of the key personnel in your proposed account team.  Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience, and accomplishments. Detail the knowledge and experience key account, creative, and production personnel have gained through complete and ongoing efforts in the B2B or B2G service space.  (3)  References for Past Performance  Provide a short list of all similar work performed by either your proposed key personnel or your organization for the last two years.  Include a description of the market segments, client profile, business objectives, strategic planning, ad campaigns, results achieved, as well as the client's name along with the MARCOM managers contact information.  Again, we are particularly interested in work completed in the service sector.  The information provided should also include details of media analysis/buying, free-lance relationships and contributions, key supplier relationships, and national or local affiliations (AAAA, SecondWind, etc.)   Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement, an original plus four (4) copies, to Susan Benik, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS 2500, Herndon, Virginia, 20170-4817.  In addition, an electronic copy shall be sent to Susan.Benik@mms.gov.  Your capabilities statement will be evaluated based on:  Capabilities Statement must demonstrate that both your organization and proposed key personnel can successfully meet our requirements.  You will be evaluated on the number, size, and complexity of brand building and marketing initiatives completed by the proposed account team and your organization including past performance to determine your potential for contract award and project success.   Past performance evaluations will assess, but not be limited to, the effectiveness of strategic marketing initiatives, the uniqueness of campaign strategies and advertising vehicles, adherence to schedules and budgets, the perceived chemistry of the account service team, and assessments of the Offeror's business integrity.  References will be checked.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking the past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  Following review of all Capabilities Statements, we will establish a list of those seemed most qualified to perform the work.  Qualified offerors will be notified and provided additional proposal instructions.  Proposal will essentially consist of a written proposal, followed by oral presentations, and a written business (cost) proposal.  Further details of proposal and logistical considerations will be provided at a later date.  Questions should be faxed or e-mailed, as soon as possible, to fax (703) 787-1009 or e-mail at susan.Benik@mms.gov.  With your questions, please include your full name, the RFP number and title, your organization, complete address, and phone/fax numbers.  Telephonic questions are strongly discouraged.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information from interested vendors on a pay parity implementation study to be performed for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Section 10702 of Public Law 107-171, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA), removes CFTC from coverage under certain provisions of Title V of the United States Code that govern the Senior Executive Service, basic pay in all pay systems, additional compensation, and benefits.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide CFTC with the opportunity to achieve compensation and benefits parity with other federal financial regulatory agencies.  CFTC intends to contract for the services of an expert in the field of compensation and benefits to present options for implementing FSRIA.  A draft statement of work has been developed for this requirement and is available on this website or may be obtained from the Contracting Officer.  The purpose of this notice is to request: (1) industry comments on the adequacy of the draft statement of work, including recommended changes/deletions/additions; (2) non-binding ballpark pricing from potential sources; (3) comments on whether this requirement could reasonably be proposed as firm-fixed price and, if not, reasons why it should not be firm-fixed price; (4) suggestions on how to revise or restructure the requirement to reduce costs, and (5) contact information for companies interested in responding to the final RFP when it is issued.  Information gathered will assist in formulating the final RFP and budgeting for the requirement, and will help identify interested vendors.  Proprietary information submitted should be labeled as such.  Comments are requested by July 8, 2002.  Responses are to be provided to the Contracting Officer by e-mail at the address cited below.  Please note that this is a Request for Information only, not a Request for Proposals.  The CFTC will not accept any proposals in response to this notice.  The CFTC does not plan to award a contract based on information received in response to this notice, nor will it pay for any information received in response to this notice.  This Request for Information should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

<DESC>The purpose of this presolicitation notice is twofold.  First, it is issued to identify interested and qualified sources for the acquisition of two E-2C Simulated Maintenance Trainers (SMTs).  Second, it is issued to notify industry of the Government's intent to utilize an Advisory Multi-Step Process in accordance with FAR 15.202 for this acquisition.  All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated in this notice, and each respondent will be advised in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Respondents considered not to be viable competitors will be advised of the general basis for that opinion.  Respondents are hereby informed that all respondents meeting the profile of the selected acquisition strategy (full and open competition, small business set-aside, etc.), notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, may participate in the resultant acquisition.  This announcement does not constitute a request for proposals.  In addition, contractors are hereby cautioned that no remuneration will be provided for responding to this notice.  Responses should be submitted to the cognizant Contract Specialist, Ms. Mary Munroe, via facsimile at 407-380-4455 or via electronic mail at MunroeME@navair.navy.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on 17 July 2002.

The SMTs will be used to train Navy Aviation Electronic Technicians (AT) and Aviation Electricians Mates (AE) personnel in initial and career maintenance skills at the Naval Air Maintenance Training Units in Norfolk, Virginia and Pt. Mugu, California.  The initial training courses focus primarily on basic theory of operation, testing, fault troubleshooting, and removal and replacement of weapons replaceable assemblies and line replaceable units.  The career courses cover detailed theory of operation and troubleshooting procedures and techniques.  The SMTs supplement the classroom career courses with more in-depth fault testing and troubleshooting hands-on experience.  Each SMT shall simulate all aircraft components necessary to train E-2C maintenance personnel in the combat information center, forward/aft equipment compartments, and cockpit for two aircraft configurations:  Group II NAVUPGRADE and Hawkeye 2000.

This acquisition will utilize a Statement of Work (SOW), a Performance Specification that will encompass the Government's requirements and a set of Contract Data Requirements Lists.  The successful Contractor will be responsible for the production, testing, packaging and shipment, installation, and support of the SMTs.  Also, the successful Contractor will be responsible for developing and delivering a technical data package, and operation and maintenance documentation.  The successful Contractor will also be required to prepare existing Government spaces for the training device installation.  With the exception of cockpit instrumentation, the use of actual aircraft hardware in the design of the training devices will be discouraged.  The training devices shall be of an open, non-proprietary nature.  Commercial and Non-Developmental Items shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.  Contractors will be encouraged to pursue life cycle support initiatives, which will result in greater operational efficiencies and reduce life cycle cost.  The Contractor shall also provide Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) to operate and maintain life cycle support for the training devices.  This includes the necessary spare parts and tools and test equipment, technical documentation, configuration and inventory management, initial and follow-on training, and two years of Contractor Logistics Support for both devices to solve software problems, assist in making difficult repairs, and provide operation, maintenance and support training.  The Government will provide limited equipment, data, and information for the procurement.  It will be the successful Contractor's responsibility to acquire all other necessary information, repair and/or renovate applicable Government Furnished Equipment, and procure all other necessary equipment.

Contract award is anticipated to occur in January 2003.  The Government contemplates issuance of draft and final RFPs sometime in August 2002 and September 2002, respectively.  All solicitation materials will be posted to the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities web site at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD .  The anticipated contract type is Fixed Price Incentive Firm.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 333319 which possesses a size standard of 500 employees.  Interested sources must provide the following information:  (1) whether you qualify as a large or small business.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Pharmacology Scientific Core (CPSC), intends to procure services for an Analytical Chemist in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only combined
synopsis/solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 06-02.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $5M.  The CPSC, has as its primary research interest the use of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic methods to develop new anticancer and antiretroviral agents.  Within the CPSC, NCI is utilizing compartmental and non-compartmental methods to define the therapeutic range for these agents.  Moreover, several clinical trials have utilized adaptive control with feedback mechanisms.  Likewise, the CPSC collaborates with numerous intramural and extramural groups by providing pharmacokinetic and analytical support.  Because utilizing these techniques to optimize the development of new anticancer agents requires a team of individuals with specialized skills, (i.e. pharmacokinetic modeling techniques, analytical techniques, pharmacodynamic techniques, etc) success is dependent on a coordinated effort between the disciplines.  The CPSC requires the skills of an analytical chemist to participate in the analytical development of CC-5013.  This shall require LC Mass Spec experiments and validation.  CC-5013 is a new compound that has entered clinical trials at the NCI.  No analytical method has previously been developed.  This shall require LC Mass Spec as NCI expects the plasma concentrations to be relatively low (ng/mL).  Such a specialist is needed to characterize the pharmacokinetics in preclinical models.  Contractor Requirements:  NCI shall send the contractor samples from the clinical trials to be quantitated by the contractor's laboratory (the specific method used is LS/MS), approximately 5000 samples over a 10 month period of time, and need a turn around time of one week from the time of receiving a batch of samples.  This is necessary to adjust dosing within the clinical trial.  The results shall be sent electronically, via electronic mail and as a hard copy.  1)  The contractor shall be required to model the data using ADAPT computer software program.  It is critical that only ADAPT be used as this program fits into the overall scheme of the research program and allows for the flexibility of pharmacodynamic- modeling of outcome evaluation of metabolism of CC5013 using a method that would be developed in the contractors laboratory. The results shall be placed into the program for pharmacokinetic analysis.  This is a specialized process that is important in understanding the results.  2)  The contractor shall provide standard curves and quality controls as well as all of the raw chromatograms from these experiments.  A full report shall be generated on the experiments done and the quality controls utilized.  Full, weekly reports, shall combine all results and the ADAPT output at the end of the period of performance.   SC and Qcs are how the contractor shall determine the quantitation from the LC/MS.  SC is a series of spiked samples and the sample in question shall be compared to it.  3) All reports shall be provided in Microsoft Word. 4)  All analytical equipment shall be done with Agilent and all records shall be transferred both electronically and by hard copy based on Agilent data methods.  This includes diode array spectrums as well as Masspec results.  The report shall include and shall be submitted at the end of the performance period of this contract:   a) Validation assay and results; b) graphs of all the data; c) provide chromatograms of all samples; d) full documentation of methods utilized; e) full documentation of quality controls; f) utilization of good laboratory safety skills; g) utilization of good laboratory techniques; h) collection, tabulation, and organization of data; i) reporting the results in written form and; j) analyze 1,000 patient samples within 10 months.

The contractor will be expected to assist and provide services and duties as may be requested for the normal operational requirements and workloads for the department and personnel.  Contractor shall provide work that is consistent with the guidelines and procedures of the IHS.  Failure contractor to meet these standards can result in cancellation of this contract.

If appropriate and necessary, the contractor shall provide consultation to the Supervisor on better improving and enhancing the program environment and delivery of services.  The contractor shall advise the project officer, contracting officer or program manager or their designated representative of any problems encountered or which may be encountered in connection with meeting the needs of the contractor?s duties.  

The contractor shall have at least two (2) or more years of post-secondary education (college) experience from an academic institution or be licensed in a field of study.  The contractor must be proficient in writing, typing and have a basic working knowledge and understanding of computer hardware and software applications.  The contractor shall have sufficient knowledge, competence and experience in providing these services on a regular schedule to the Billings Area IHS. 

Due to some limited driving requirements, the contractor must hold a current, valid state drivers license from any of the 50 United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The contractor shall possess sufficient initiative, interpersonal relationship skills, social sensitivity and appropriate professional behavior such that the contractor can relate constructively to IHS employees, contractors, vendors and individuals from the Native American community. The contractor shall not have any work or health restrictions, which could directly or indirectly interfere with the performance of providing services as there will be some moderate lifting and moving of furniture as well as boxes of office supplies and equipment.  The contractor shall maintain acceptable standards of personal hygiene and grooming such that their image as a Federal contract employee is compatible with the expectations of the IHS staff. This Personal Service Contract is not guaranteed to any one specific individual or business, nor does it belong to any specific individual or business.

As a Federal contract employee, taxes, retirement, social security, insurance deductions or any other form of deduction will be withheld from their invoice or pay request.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WITHOLD LOCAL, STATE OR FEDERAL TAXES UNDER A PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT.  THEREFORE IT IS THE CONTRACTORS SOLE-RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN LOCAL, STATE, FEDERAL TAXES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Special Operations Acquisition and Logistics Center, Directorate of Procurement, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Corporation, Defensive Systems Division, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-1098 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1: ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?  The USSOCOM has a requirement to add the AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) system to the MH-53 and to upgrade the AN/AAQ-24(V) on USSOCOM?s C-130s, with a multi-band laser jamming energy source.  For clarification, for the MH-53 requirement, this specific effort shall require the removal of the ALQ-157 and in its place install the multi-band laser based AAQ-24 DIRCM system on MH-53 aircraft, with Group-A fittings installed on all aircraft.  The objectives of this task are to design, develop, and demonstrate an effective, flight worthy installation of the AAQ-24 DIRCM system on the MH-53 aircraft; appropriately modify the aircraft and install the DIRCM system; and, support initial fielding and sustainment. The reason justifying the lack of competition is that Northrop Grumman Corporation is the original equipment manufacturer of the multi-band laser based AN/AAQ-24(V) system; they are the only contractor who has the DIRCM, SOF C-130 installation, a production ready multi-band laser jamming energy source that has been successfully integrated with the AN/AAQ-24(V) and satisfies the C-130 installation constraints, and laser data; and, they possess a fully functional DIRCM system integration laboratory necessary to support this effort. The Government did not purchase the data rights for the DIRCM; thus, the Government does not have drawings to provide. With the exception of the aircraft for modification, USSOCOM will not provide any GFE in support of this effort. USSOCOM anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity task and delivery order type contract with firm fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee, and time and material contract line items.  The estimated amount is $220 million over a five year period. All responsible sources may submit a proposal in accordance with Note 22 that shall be considered by the agency.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Jacqueline (Jackie) Foreid-Germain, foreidj@socom.mil  fax (813)282-7504. See Numbered Note #22.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), intends to procure on an other than full and open competitive basis with Trustees of Dartmouth College, 11 Rope Ferry Road, #6210, Hanover, NH 03775, for continuation of a national demonstration and evaluation of previously developed Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Toolkits (now referred to as Resource Kits).  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source because of the unique nature of this evaluation/demonstration as a follow-on activity from previous development of the EBP Toolkits.  SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant learning period, and would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The National EBP Project is an initiative sponsored by a broad coalition of groups coordinated by Dartmouth College.  The purpose of the EBP Project is to develop and evaluate practical documentation and guidance about selected evidenced-based clinical practices.  The contractor will be required to: (1) provide technical assistance to eight (8) States involved in pilot testing of the EBP Resource Kits; (2) conduct a cross-site analysis of local evaluation data gathered from the States; and (3) use the resulting data from the States to revise the EBP Resource Kits.  The estimated period of performance is three (3) years.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply to this notice.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  Send written responses to the point of contact identified above, referencing 280-02-8070.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with the Polisher Research Institute located within the Madlyn and Leonard Abramson Center (formerly Philadelphia Geriatric Center), 1425 Horsham Road, North Wales, PA 19454, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1 to award a contract to develop a lexicon (i.e., comprehensive database) of technologies utilized in long-term care settings and to identify barriers to the process of implementing technologies in these settings. The contractor must develop a searchable, updateable lexicon of existing and emerging technologies in nursing homes and residential care settings. The lexicon shall include technologies in use in these settings in areas including, but not limited to, incontinence, fall prevention, nurse call systems, and egress systems. Entry for each technology in the lexicon shall include descriptive information including its ease of use, cost-benefit ratio, clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes. Entry shall also include a statement of potential tradeoffs associated with each technology alternative in each area. The lexicon shall be made available through a web-based interface, thereby facilitating access and input internationally by professionals engaged in the planning, design, administration, professional care, and research in long-term care facilities. The contractor must also identify the legislative, economic, and social barriers to the process of implementing these technologies in nursing home and residential care settings. This task shall include a discussion of variations across settings in barriers to technology implementation as well as an investigation of what technology outreach programs are available to nursing homes and residential care settings. A major requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses expertise and extensive research experience in analyses of technological applications in long-term care as well as policy issues regarding elderly, disabilities, and long-term care. The Polisher Research Institute alone has unique qualifications and expertise that would allow the project to be completed in time to provide information relevant to government policymaking. Furthermore, the Polisher Research Institute is in receipt of substantial grant funding (totaling approximately $285,000) from the Alzheimer's Association and the Extendicare Foundation that supplement the efforts to achieve the purposes of the proposed project. Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any contractor but the Polisher Research Institute would result in a significant increase in cost. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a cost estimate and statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as described above. No solicitation document is available. Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above. See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), intends on entering into a sole source contract with Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., 12740 Earhart Avenue, Auburn, CA 95602, for a Automac Cell Separator with accessories and premium warranty.  Researchers of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, are involved in the Immunomagnetic separation of cells for the isolation of B cells, CD4+, CD8+T cells and NK cells.  The ability to carry out these isolations/separations will require an additional Automac Cell Separator. Current research indicates that the number of cell separations will increase, due to the limited availability of a single machine to numerous researchers, a second system is required and must be compatible with existing systems.  The purchase of an additional system would be available to all researchers in the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, also would enable the LTIB a significant reduction in the amount of time per separation, increase yield and purity of cells, and reproducibility due to automation of the process. Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., is the only source known to the government that can provide a system with the above characteristics.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on July 1, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.102(c) under the test program. If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Lu Deng, Gaithersburg, Maryland, for technical assistance services to maintain the NIST Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) beamline (BL-2).  The contractor shall also devise plans and strategies on how to systematically upgrade and improve the calibration standards to meet the challenge of the NASA flight instrumentation tests and work with NIST staff to design, assemble and commission a test magnet calibration system.  The Contractor shall also provide technical support for the NASA team on calibration experiments.  Work shall be performed at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland site.  The period of performance shall be one year from date of award and two additional option years for similar services.  This is a sole source requirement with Dr. Deng because he has extensive experience with SURF experimental facilities, including BL-2.  It would be impossible to find another contractor with the requisite experience to perform these tasks in the time required for this project.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received by the date identified above.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation is not available.  See Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
for
Smithsonian Website/Multimedia Pro-Bono Development

1.	General.  The Smithsonian Institution was created by Act of the United States Congress in 1846 to carry out the terms of the Will of James Smithson who bequeathed the means to found a national institution based in Washington dedicated to  ?the increase and diffusion of knowledge . . . .?  The estate property was accepted by Congress which pledged the faith of the United States to a charitable trust for the benefit of the People of the United States.  The trust is administered by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, composed of the Chief Justice, the Vice President, three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and nine citizens appointed by joint resolution of Congress.

2.	Background.  On April 30, 2002, the Smithsonian Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs (OEEMA) in conjunction with the Smithsonian Office of Contracting (OCon) conducted a Web/Multimedia Fair in which 68 web/multimedia vendors/producers participated.  At the Fair, Smithsonian staff were approached by multiple vendors requesting information about contracting opportunities for Smithsonian projects, whether paid or not.  In response to this unforeseen demand, Smithsonian program offices were invited to create a ?wish-list? of projects for which development and implementation were immediately desirable.  The result is attached separately to this notice for the review of any interested vendors (the ?Wish List?).

3.	Project Descriptions.  The Wish List is a synopsis, by Smithsonian museum/program office, of current needs for which there is no or insufficient money for development.  For all identified projects, we have estimated project size in accordance with the following scale: (A More Perfect Union <http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/experience/index.html> = small, Hirshhorn redesign <http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/> = medium, Explore the Universe <http://www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal111/universe/etu/index.html> = large), and, where relevant, the desired timeframe for completion. Initially created and posted on June 25, 2002, we intend to keep the Wish List up to date, adding newly identified needs and removing projects for which sufficient qualified and serious vendor response has been received as well as any for which a full commitment for programmatic support has lapsed.  Smithsonian reserves the right to rescind the Wish List in the event that insufficient response is generated on the identified projects.

4.	Minimum Requirements for Pre-Solicitation Response.  We can?t build it if you don?t come, therefore we invite interested and qualified vendors to identify those projects for which they would like to submit an offer.  To be responsive, submissions need merely identify your company, your URL, and any project(s) for which you desire the opportunity to develop on a pro bono basis. Please be sure to stipulate any restrictions which may apply to your level of interest (stating a hierarchy of preferred projects if, for example, you would care to submit a proposal for multiple ones but only enter into a contract to create a single one). This information will be collected and distributed to the originating program offices on a rolling basis, and for each project, as soon as a suitable bidlist has been established (e.g., at least 2-3 qualified candidates) we will contact the prospective offerors.  An indication of project interest by vendor(s) shall NEITHER obligate the vendor to submit a proposal to perform any work NOR obligate Smithsonian to invite proposals or issue contract(s) to have work performed.

5.	Responding to this Announcement:  Prospective offerors may ONLY submit information via e-mail to Bruce Falk, Office of Contracting at FalkB@si.edu.  Since it is presumed that relevant portfolios are viewable at the vendors? URL or obtainable upon request, no work samples are sought or required at this time. Offerors whosubmitted proposals in response to Smithsonian?s IDIQ RFP#F0236SOL0012 are permitted to make reference to any samples provided therein.  For these reasons, submissions greater than ONE SINGLE PAGE in length will be met with disdain.  (We are trying to make identification of desirable projects by interested firms as easy as possible; invited vendors will be given full opportunity to provide proposal(s) which address in detail specific project requirements.)

6.	Methodology for Competition.  Because these projects have little or no money attached to them, we will conduct the solicitation process in the following way.  First, the seriousness of vendor intent will be determined by follow-up contact prior to establishment of a bidlist, as bidlists will be kept small (preferring three offerors, but in no event more than five ? to the extent that more than five vendors express serious interest in a given project, we will make a determination as to which vendors to invite to submit a bid to ensure limited competition while minimizing vendor burden).  Second, identified, interested vendors will be provided with all criteria needed to draft a responsive proposal and invited to an initial discussion with the project team at least two weeks prior to the formal submission date.  Finally, Smithsonian shall evaluate the received proposals and intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is evaluated to be responsive to project/solicitation requirements and the best from among all proposals received.  While specific criteria for any given project will be established and provided to preselected offerors prior to establishing a proposal due date, it is likely that credit recognition for any pro bono work awarded as a result of this announcement will be approximately equal to or greater than that currently offered by Smithsonian for its fully-budgeted development.

7.	Further Contact Info.  Please contact Bruce Falk immediately if you desire to receive a copy of the Wish List by e-mail, fax, or other format.  Vendors desiring clarification can submit questions either by phone (202) 275-1602, or in writing, by e-mail, or by fax at (202) 275-0624.  (We will make all reasonable effort to answer questions, but cannot guarantee response.)  Thank you for your attention to this pre-solicitation notice.  We look forward to hearing from you!

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to incorporate uploaded specifications and to extend the responses due date to July 3, 2002. RF Plasma Spray Controlled Motion Manipulator This request is for a new motion control system, we do not wish to change any existing bearings, seals, belts or pulley hardware.  This is not a system upgrade, but rather one-to-one replacement of existing, antiquated equipment.  Please only accept quotes to replace the programmable logic controller (PLC), operator interface display, servo amplifier, and servomotors. The replacement PLC, operator interface touch screen display and servo amplifiers should be all mounted in a 19-inch rack mountable NEMA 12 class enclosure. The enclosure should be approximately six feet tall. The enclosure should have a smoked polycarbonate type of front viewing door, and a closeable door on the back. The display should be mounted in the front of cabinet, with approximately a 10" screen for good visibility from short distances.  The servomotors will be installed on the target manipulator and will be connected to the cabinet by cables, from a distance of approximately 25 feet.  The rotation servomotor adapts to an  Indiana Power Transmission Sys. Inc.  Model: HQD-B-56C reduction gear box. Rotation should be capable of 0 to 100 RPM.  The translation servomotor has a 0.1875 inch keyed slot and shaft that fits a  pulley with a 0.55 inch inside diameter. Shaft should be about 1.75 inch length from mounting surface.  The translation speed should be capable  0 to 2 inch per second. The PLC will be utilized to control two modes of operation; 1) Mandrel mode: controls rotation and translation of a round mandrel attached to a 2.5 inch diameter water cooled sting shaft that is manipulated inside a low-pressure vacuum chamber. 2) Table mode: controls a flat tabletop target in an X-Y fashion. It utilizes rotational motion to index the table in the Y direction and translates the same way as in the Mandrel mode. The system only operates in one mode at a time. If the sting is set-up with a  mandrel then "mandrel mode" will be selected, if the sting is set-up with the X-Y table then "table mode" should be selected. These are two separate modes of operation. The display will be capable of accessing the program information in the PLC and be able to create multiple schedules of motion, and be able to store and recall them from that same display. The display will replace existing displays and provide motion speed and position (actual speed and RPM, not set point values) for both axes, and both modes.  A remote manual jog switch is to be provided, that can be operated from 25 feet away, at the chamber location. The jog switch will provide manual rotation and manual translation control for both modes of operation. The system will be capable of operating in a continuous mode, or running a preset number of cycles for both table and mandrel modes. The system shall be pre-assembled in the cabinet prior to delivery to the facility.  The servomotors shall be adapted to the existing hardware upon delivery. The price quoted shall include assembly, delivery, installation, debugging and training provided to the operators of the equipment. The equipment manuals for all of the sub-components are also to be provided upon delivery. The current system hardware for the 2.5 in. diameter manipulator (sting) shaft.  The rotation axis is belt driven from the reduction gear box to the 2.5 in. diameter sting shaft, by the following components:  Rotational Servo-Drive Motor:  Motor: Yaskawa Electric AC Servo Motor Type: USASEM-15A-C2K S/N: 111828-1 KW	KG-CM	RPM	A	RATING 1.54	50	3000	10.4	Cont. Rotational Servo-Amplifier  Yaskawa Electric CACR-SRCA -15BBB REV.E (O) DF8101720-E0 Reduction Gear Indiana Power Transmission Sys. Inc. Model: HQD-B-56C Ratio: 17.445: 1 S/N: 123091-2 HP 2.75 The translation axis is belt driven from the servomotor to the lead screw, by the following components: Translation Drive Motor: Motor: Yaskawa Electric AC Servo Motor Type: USASEM-03A-E2K S/N: R05HA123 W	KG-CM	RPM 308	10	3000 Translation Amplifier Yaskawa Electric CACR-SRCA-03BBB  REV.D (1) DF8101720-D1 Reduction Gear None System PLC Unit MITSUBISHI "MELSEC-A" PLC RACK SYSTEM  CARD LAYOUT: AINCPU, AD72, AY80, AX71, AY23 System uses a "BEIJER ELECRONICS" display unit: Model: E-300 Type: 02750C 24 VDC The system also contains three readout devices, which are "Red Lion" displays, which are fed from a PLC output card. The new display should replace the old  "Red Lion" displays.  The I/O configuration should be the same as identified in the existing Mitsubishi PLC card configuration layout listed above.  Existing hardware items: The system has three rotational bearings; two are used to mount the translation table to the sting shaft and allow for rotation motion only.  The third is a Thomson TM linear ball bearing, model number CMB-40 19207 SOCN, which is mounted inside a feed-through chamber with multiple wiper, quad and o-ring seals to maintain vacuum integrity. The translation drive system is a table arrangement that supports the rotational drive components, and uses two rotational Timken TM 2.5 in. bearings clamps (P/N 925ODE), and a Sealmaster TM  bearing model RPB 208-2 around the sting shaft which are secured at both ends of the table. The table is attached to a ball screw arrangement that is mounted to a 1 in. diameter, 4 threads per inch pitch, lead screw.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on 1 October 2002. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 26 Jun 02. The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET). The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 1 Sep 02, with a performance start date of 1 Oct 02.The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>The Biological Testing Program (BTP), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking organizations having the capability to provide a genetic monitoring resource for the BTP.  Genetic monitoring for quality assurance will accompany the long standing efforts in microbiological quality, in order that each animal produced from rederived stock, under our production contracts, is as well defined as possible.  Genetic monitoring will be accomplished by biochemical means, i.e., testing for loci involved in producing cellular enzyme or protein variants.  It is anticipated that one (1) contract will be awarded for this effort, as a result of this RFP, for a period of sixty (60) months.  This RFP is a recompetition of the "Biochemical Genetic Monitoring of Rodents" project being performed by Texas A&M University.  RFP No. N02-CM-32402 will be available on or about June 21, 2002, by written request from Ms. Patricia A. White, Contract Specialist, Management Operations and Support Branch, NCI-Frederick, Building 427, Room 10, Frederick, Maryland  21702-1201, (301) 846-5473.

<DESC>Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) aids U.S. businesses of all sizes to invest and compete in more than 140 emerging markets and developing nations worldwide.  OPIC is a Federal agency of the U.S. Government.   OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs is charged with providing the agency with high-quality legal representation and advice in the most practical, efficient, and cost-effective manner. To assist it in discharging these responsibilities, OPIC?s Department of Legal Affairs engages, from time to time, outside counsel.  A description of our mission and programs is found in the OPIC Program Handbook, a copy of which can be obtained from OPIC?s website at http://www.opic.gov.

OPIC contemplates the award of Basic Agreements to qualified legal firms on a competitive basis. Award of a Basic Agreement does not guarantee award of a contract, which would be the basis for performance of services.  Prospective Contractor Lists (?Lists?) will be created based on those firms awarded Basic Agreements. The Lists will be utilized to solicit bids from law firms to act as outside counsel to OPIC on matters falling within areas of expertise for which OPIC maintains a List. 

The following Lists will be developed from this competition:
1. Project Finance List: Structuring, negotiation and documentation of international project finance transactions (typically, OPIC loans to projects ranging from $20 million to $250 million), and due diligence in connection with same;
2. Insurance Claims List: Arbitration (typically under AAA international arbitration rules) arising in connection with claims for compensation under OPIC?s political risk insurance policies; and 

3.  	Investment Funds List: Structuring, negotiation, and documentation of secured loans to international private equity investment funds, and review of fund formation documents for compliance with OPIC?s program objectives.

Law firms seeking to be placed on the Lists in respect of legal services must satisfy each of the General Criteria listed below.  In addition, counsel must satisfy the specific criteria relating to the List on which such counsel seeks inclusion.

A.  General Criteria for each of the Three Lists:
&#61623; The firm must be willing to commit specific partners to the matter, in consultation with OPIC.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient depth to provide additional experienced partners and associates, in consultation with OPIC, if needs increase beyond initial expectations.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient associate depth to commit at least one associate full-time and one associate part-time for each OPIC matter, in each case with not less than 3 years relevant experience and excellent drafting skills.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient paralegal depth to commit at least one full-time and one part-time paralegal for each OPIC matter.
&#61623; The firm must have sufficient depth of capable attorney, paralegal, and support resources (word processing, proofreading, document distribution) to meet quick turn around times.
&#61623; The firm at a minimum, should have an office in Washington, DC and New York, NY, and members of the project team handling representation of OPIC (the ?OPIC Team?) must be able to travel as required by OPIC.
&#61623; The firm and the OPIC Team must have acceptable standards for monitoring conflicts of interest.  The firm must agree to sign the OPIC Conflicts Memorandum.

B.  Specific Criteria for each of the Three Lists:
a) Project Finance List
&#61623; The firm must have significant expertise in general commercial practice, including tax, corporate, securities, bank finance, secured lending, and commercial litigation.
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must include lawyers admitted to practice in New York and the District of Columbia.  A member of the OPIC Team must be qualified to render a New York legal opinion.
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must include one or more partners with not less than 10 years aggregate experience and not less than 5 years as lead partner on international project finance transactions in emerging market economies.  Experience representing lenders in such transactions is preferred, but similar experience would be considered.
&#61623; The firm must have one or more partners with not less than five years experience in domestic securities placement transactions.
b) Insurance Claims List
The firm must have significant expertise in arbitration, in particular international arbitration and arbitration under AAA rules, international law, and foreign law relating to direct foreign investment; and insurance law (preferably including political risk insurance).
c) Investment Funds List
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must have significant recent experience structuring, negotiating, and documenting the formation of private equity investment funds investing offshore, preferably in emerging markets and preferably representing lead institutional investors who actively negotiate the terms of the relationship between the fund manager and the investors.  Representation of the fund manager is relevant experience, but representation of the investor side is preferable.  OPIC Team must have demonstrated knowledge of historical private equity partnership terms and conditions and more recent industry standards is preferable.
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must have significant recent experience structuring, negotiating, and documenting, and restructuring limited partnerships or limited liability companies, and demonstrated skill in addressing problems that can arise between the general and limited partners.
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must have significant experience structuring, negotiating, and documenting debt and equity investments in emerging markets.  
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must have significant experience structuring loan participation and capital market financing.
&#61623; The proposed OPIC Team must have broad-based commercial experience, including the areas of secured lending, structured finance, securities, tax, and commercial litigation.

<DESC>Requirement is for overhaul of reparable, B-1B Load Arrestors NSN 1680-01-181-4175MH (PN 1171-3).  Description of Reparable Item: The item is designed to permit normal seat adjustment movements and rapid retraction of the B-1B seat carriage prior to ejection.  Under high load conditions, which tend to tilt the seat carriage forward, the load arrestor will lock and become a rigid structural member supporting the top of the seat carriage. It will also act as a support member preventing backward tilt of the seat carriage under wind loading conditions during seat ejections.  The arrestor consists of a self-contained hydraulic cylinder assembly, an internal piston and check valve designed to permit fluid flow past a piston at movement rates of 1 inch/sec in either direction (normal seat adjustment) and in retraction mode at a rate of 72 in/sec. The load arrestors must be overhauled when they leak fluid. Type of Contract: one-year, FFP requirements contract with three, one-year options. Item was designed by Goodrich to meet Rockwell specification L190C2024. Drawings are proprietary to Goodrich. The Government has no data or test equipment for overhaul, or repair, of this item. No GFP; No CAP.  BEQ is 60 ea/year. Contract will provide for G009 reporting with work requirements IAW Statement of Objectives.  Government required delivery is 8 arrestors per month starting 45 days after contractor receipt of assets.  Estimated issue date: 05 Jun 02 with proposal due 05 Jul 02. To: Universal Propulsions Co, Inc - CAGE 51998. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<RESPDATE>071102
<CONTACT>MARGARET RHINESMITH, PROCUREMENT TECHNICIAN, (973)724-3050
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is seeking interested parties for a proposed contractual effort to update exisitng and procure additional full-scale and  reduced-scale models that contain section M231 and M232 charges.  The 155mm  M231/M232 propelling charges known as MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System)  are two different propelling charges designed and developed at Picatinny  Arsenal, that provide a complete zoning solution for 155MM Artillery  applications by using multiples of a basic increment.  During development and  fielding of the MACS charge, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted  for the creation of full-scale displays and reduced-scale models of the MACS to  illustrate charge construction, packaging and field application.  Improvement  of the MACS charge over time has resulted in various displays and models  becoming outdated.  Updating displays and models will regain their usefulness  in exhibition and training applications.  In addition to the displays and  models requiring modification, certain new displays are needed for special  applications.  The M231 charges are used at lower zones (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3 thru 6).  The models include  renovating or producing Zoning Solution displays, which contain 1/3 scale  charge models displayed on a wooden platform that demonstrate the scale charge  models depicting the M231 and M232 charge, Destop Training displays (Full scale  cutaway) showing the interior of each charge and labeling of respective  components, and M231/M232 Packaged Cutaways which are displayed in their metal  ammo storage container.  Firms with experience in the areas cited above should  provide a summary of their company's capabilities including a description of  facilities, personnel and past expereience by 11 July 2002. Request that all  information be submitted via electronic mail to mrhines@pica.army.mil. Large  files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com).

<SUBJECT>A -- request for information high power solid state laser
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - HIGH POWER SOLID STATE LASER.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Solid State Lasers Branch (DELO), as part of the Directed Energy Directorate (DE) at Kirtland AFB NM is seeking information, comments and suggestions, on its draft plan for high-power solid-state laser technology.  Contractors funded under this accelerated laser development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, experimentation, and testing to demonstrate and deliver to the Air Force a 25 kW-class, near diffraction limited diode-pumped solid-state laser.  Consideration shall be given to laser system size, weight, efficiency, reliability, scalability to the 100 kW level, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability, and ruggedness. The laser system should be modularized (i.e. the laser head physically separated from the power supplies, control console and cooling system) to support the installation and safe operation at Government facilities and to facilitate eventual testing using platform specific subsystems.  For similar reasons, provision shall be made for remote control of the deliverable system.  The ambient operating temperature range of the device should be 40 to 100 degrees F.  The system's storage temperature range should be -10 to 110 F.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that address the following goals:  (a) The average power of the laser output beam shall be at least 25kW.  (b) The laser beam quality shall be better than 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) with a goal of 1.2 xDL.  The beam quality specification shall be based on a power-in-the-bucket measurement in the far field.  This beam quality shall be maintained for the entire run-time as specified in (f).  (c) The contractor shall perform a intermediate stage laser demonstration at an average output power and beam quality that clearly shows scalability to the program goal outlined in (a) and (b).  At this point, the contractor will assess the risk involved in reaching the 25 kW power level and present a risk reduction plan to the Government.  (d) The laser system wall-plug efficiency shall be greater than 10%.  Herein, wall-plug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used in the laser.  (e) The start up time for the laser shall be less than 50 ms. This is defined as the time required to go from a stand-by condition to a condition where all output requirements are met.  Stand by condition is defined as all temperature maintenance operational but no power delivered to the optical pumping mechanism for the laser.  (f) The run time of the laser shall be greater than 300 seconds as measured from the time the output power meets the requirement of (a) and (b) to the time optical input power is shut down.  The laser shall be able to meet this run time in any combination of time increments.  The laser shall meet the requirements of (e) for every time increment.  (g) The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 5% of the far field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) power points.  (h) The waste heat from the laser shall be delivered in a mode compatible with an on-board aircraft heat exchanger.  There shall be no open cycle or blow down cooling techniques used in the laser.        (i) Average output power to mass ratio for the laser head shall be greater than 100W/kg.  The laser head is nominally defined as the laser system minus the system heat exchangers, coolers, power supplies, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchangers, mechanical structures, etc.), optics, mounts, along with a base plate, cover, and necessary fixtures.  This RFI announcement is issued for information and planning purposes, rather than procurement purposes, and no funding will be provided by AFRL for effort in response to this RFI.  The due date for response is 9:00 AM MDST on 01 July 2002.  Electronic response is encouraged; send via email attachment in MS Word format to Capt Kalliroi Lagonik at kalliroi.lagonik@kirtland.af.mil.  Questions regarding the RFI itself may be directed to Capt Lagonik at 505-853-2001.  The anticipated release date for the PRDA announcement is 19 July 2002.

<SUBJECT>A -- nonkinetic /limited effects/non-lethal weapons for crowd control
<DESC>(1) General Statement of Research Need 
  Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), in support of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), is soliciting proposals that address research and development for the application and employment of new nonkinetic/limited effects/non-lethal weapons for crowd control and area denial to personnel.  Some of the operational context for crowd control and area denial to personnel is to: Disperse a crowd within 50 meters of friendly forces, disperse a crowd that is 50-1000 meters from friendly forces, direct crowd movement, contain or stop the crowd from advancing, deny area to personnel in urban/suburban and rural/open terrain, or provide for force protection against a point or area threat.  Submissions should describe assimilation of new and/or existing technologies that can be mounted on platforms such as Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) or in existing weapons such as 40MM grenades and 12 gauge shotgun rounds.  This solicitation will NOT fund development of any new UGVs.  Some possible technologies are advanced riot control agents, dazzling lights/lasers, electrical shock suppression systems, audible acoustics (no infrasound, please).  The desired capabilities for the payload is for quick human effect onset time (less than 90 seconds), ideally has a human effect duration of between 10-60 minutes, temporarily renders target incapable or unwilling to continue, its deployment is readily evident, requires no decontamination and is not an environmental hazard, is difficult to countermeasure, and can be stored for at least five years.  A statement of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the technology is required (A description of TRLs and proposal format can be found at the JNLWD website www.jnlwd.usmc.mil in the Technology Investment Program Solicitation tab).  The proposals should address work to be conducted over a period not longer than two years.  Proposals should be no more than $250,000.  All proposals selected for funding will be required to submit quarterly status reports that include financial data and present an annual Director's review.  At project completion, a comprehensive report and outbrief will be required.

(2) Instructions for Preparation of Proposals
Offerors are invited to electronically submit an initial quad proposal, in either MS PowerPoint or Adobe Acrobat (the proposal file size can be no larger than 1.5MB due to server limitations).  If the file size is larger than 1.5MB, the proposal must be mailed and postmarked by 25 July 2002.  If your proposal is classified, please inquire to receive appropriate instructions.  The initial proposal shall be in the form of a quad chart which contains a title and the following information: UPPER RIGHT QUAD:  a Photograph or artist?s concept of the project end-item.  Ideally, this will convey the main idea of the final capability/use of the prototype.  It should further give an idea of the size and weight of the end item.  UPPER LEFT QUAD:  payload description:  what type of technology is involved, TRL, what indicates the technology will be a success (specific research criteria, analogy to other systems, currently fielded capability, theoretical evaluation), what areas/gaps in the technology exist.  Health effects:  identify specific research that will allow a thorough characterization, counter-personnel non-lethal systems shall have reversible effects (permanent/severe injuries should be minimized).  The desire is for weapon effects to become inert and/or have no residual effect on humans with the simple passage of time; include the duration of the effect.  LOWER RIGHT QUAD:  Proposed technical approach:  tasks, prior efforts, rough order of magnitude costs and schedule.  LOWER LEFT QUADRANT:  Deliverables to include quarterly status reports, final reports, final outbriefs, any hardware, software, etc.  Include Point of Contact information (address, email, and phone number).

Invitations for final proposals will be extended after evaluation of quad charts. Offerors submitting the most promising initial proposal will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their initial proposal submission.  Final proposals will be submitted electronically in either MS PowerPoint or Adobe Acrobat.  File sizes smaller than 1.5MB may be submitted electronically by 27 September 2002.  Files larger than 1.5MB must be postmarked by 27 September 2002.  However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Final proposals should not exceed fifteen (15) pages of text and will be required to have the following three sections:

1) Technical Section includes: (a) a clear statement of objectives, tasks, and description of proposed concept, (b) provide background information in areas of technical, historical and applicability, (c) technical approach and methodology:  The proposal shall identify the technology, explain how and why it would be effective, and provide rationale for verifying the desired effect.  Specific areas to address include: What type of technology is involved? Electronic? Electromagnetic? Mechanical?  What is the proposed delivery mechanism?  What indicates that the technology will be a success? (Specific research, analogy to other systems, currently fielded capability, theoretical evaluation).  What areas or gaps in the technology need to be researched/explored? (d) Discussion of associated risks, (e) Health Effects - The proposal should identify specific research that will allow a thorough characterization.  The proposal should be able to identify the effect the weapon will have on the targeted individual(s) and address the overall health effects (including how such effect is known) associated with employment of the system.  Counter-personnel non-lethal systems shall have reversible effects (permanent/severe injuries should be minimized).  The desire is for the weapon effects to become inert and/or have no residual effect on humans with the simple passage of time:  What is the mechanism for the desired effect?  What are the important parameters for describing the desired effect and what is the threshold for effectiveness in terms of those parameters?  What is the duration of the desired effect?  What are the most likely undesired health effects from the use of the technology?  What are the important parameters for describing the undesired health effects and what are the thresholds for those undesired effects?  What is the variability in response over the range of the human population?  (f) describe the schedule for developing the proposed concept and relate to near (2-4 years), mid (4-7 years) and/or far (greater than 7 years) term.

2) A Management Section which includes a description of relevant corporate expertise, experience, facilities, and other relevant resources, and resumes of key personnel.

3) A Cost Section, which provides a detailed breakdown (a plan of actions and milestones) of the proposed effort described in the technical section and deliverables.  Cost needs to include travel to JNLWD Quantico for two reviews per year and the cost of producing a final technical report.  Included in the final report shall be a signed cover sheet by your organization?s senior management, table of contents, abstract or executive summary, references, and conclusions.  The Cost Section will not be included in the 15 page proposal limit.

The deadline for initial quad chart proposals will be 1600 DST 25 July 2002.  Final proposals will be required by 1600 EST, 27 September 2002. Offerors must state in their initial quad proposal and final proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for initial proposal or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All initial proposals will be acknowledged.  Initial proposals will not be returned after evaluation.
