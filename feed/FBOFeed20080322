Background:  The National Park Service has initiated efforts to address hypotheses associated with the decline of harbor seals in Glacier Bay NP.  Glacier Bay has historically supported one of the largest breeding populations of harbor seals in Alaska.  Harbor seals are an important apex predator and the most numerous marine mammals in the park; however, harbor seals have declined by up to 75% in Glacier Bay since 1992 when monitoring efforts began.  In 2004, the National Park Service initiated research aimed at addressing hypotheses associated with the decline of harbor seals in Glacier Bay National Park.  The research requires the capture of harbor seals to assess survival, body condition, health and disease status, and movements. 2.  Contractor shall provide a research vessel in support of the National Park Service harbor seal research program. This includes providing a vessel charter, meals and lodging for eleven (11) NPS passengers/personnel and associated technical expertise to facilitate the safe capture and handling of harbor seals in Glacier Bay National Park in southeastern Alaska.  Vessel must be able to depart Auke Bay, Alaska in early September 2008 (dates to be determined later) for approximately 6-10 days. The vessel must be able to travel from Auke Bay to Glacier Bay on the first day of the charter and be at the study site ready for capture efforts to begin on the morning of the second day of the charter. 3.  The National Park Service (NPS) will pay for only those days the charter will be utilized for the two charter periods in April and September and cannot guarantee a minimum or maximum number of days.  The length of charter is estimated and can be terminated at any time by NPS due to unforeseen circumstances.  Area of operation will be Glacier Bay, Alaska.   4.  The vessel will be required to provide sleeping areas for 11 passengers, 3 meals per day, fuel for chartered vessel, adequate deck and laboratory space,  a utility (hydraulics) crane to load and off-load seals and Government owned equipment and gear, and enough water for drinking and showers for passengers and crew for at least 10 days. 5.  Research passengers/personnel will meet the vessel at Auke Bay, Juneau, Alaska to load equipment and supplies on the day before departure.  Research crew will be responsible for loading supplies aboard the vessel in Auke Bay.  Vessel must be available for loading of gear the day prior to charter and staterooms will be available for sleeping quarters (no food is provided on the loading day).   SPECIFICATIONS: 1.
