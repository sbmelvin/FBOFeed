<CONTACT>Sharon L. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-1781, Email sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is soliciting proposals for multiple IDIQ/Task Order contracts through which individual Task Orders will be awarded to maintain, serve, and support the AHRQ National Resource Center for Health Information Technology (NRC).

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Potential offerors are responsible to monitor these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

AHRQ anticipates awarding multiple contracts under this RFP for each of four separate domain areas:  (1) Support for Health IT Program Management, Guidance, Assessment and Planning; (2) Health IT Technical Assistance, Content Development, Program Related Projects and Studies; (3) Health IT Dissemination, Communication and Marketing; and (4) Health IT Portal Infrastructure Management and Website Design and Usability Support.   Offerors may choose to submit proposals for one or more of these four domains, but are strongly encouraged to submit proposals only for those domains which they are particularly qualified.  Resultant contracts will specify the domain under which the contractor is eligible to compete and receive task orders.

It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made in each of four Domains with a base period of performance of one year with four option years. Multiple awards of master contracts are expected by the end of May 2009, and multiple individual task orders are expected to be awarded by August 2009.   AHRQ anticipates awarding approximately 3-6 contracts per domain with no more than 10 contracts per domain.  However, this is an estimate only.  AHRQ reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts per domain area.  Through the issuance of task orders, AHRQ expects to award approximately $25 million, contingent on available funds, over the course of the one year base and four option year periods, with the potential of $50 million if the program expands and gains federal partners.

It is AHRQ’s desire to award contracts to a mixture of large and small businesses.  While the solicitation is full and open competition, AHRQ’s intent is to reserve some awards in some of the domains for small business.  For Domains 2 and 4, AHRQ reserves at least 20% of the contract awards to small business; for Domain 3, AHRQ reserves at least 50% of the contract awards to small business.  Domain 1 is unrestricted.  Should an insufficient number of small businesses be deemed to be technically qualified in each domain, AHRQ reserves the right to award to other than small business to reach the required number of awards needed in each domain.  

Offerors must have an understanding of and experience in the Domain areas described  below for which proposals are being submitted. Sources must possess, or be able to obtain (in-house or through subcontracting / consulting arrangements) the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed.

Key personnel shall include a Project Director with extensive experience in health IT and program management and either a doctoral degree or senior level management experience directing at least $5M projects.

For Domain 2 - Health IT Technical Assistance, Content Development, Program Related Projects and Studies, the contractor shall have the ability to effectively perform technical assistance, establish and support collaborative efforts among government, academic and other public and private organizations, develop and evaluate Health IT tools and products, develop content and syntheses of Health IT topics, project results and best practices, perform Health IT research, development and implementation projects and studies, and propose new visionary approaches for applying Health IT, to improve the quality, safety, effectiveness and efficiency of health care.

Background
In 2004, AHRQ established a single external NRC and a web site (healthit.ahrq.gov) to support its efforts to advance the goals of the HHS and AHRQ for transforming health care through the best and most effective use of health IT.  The NRC supports the AHRQ health IT program by serving as a central national source of information and assistance to help the nation and assistance to help the nation embrace the power and efficiency of health information technology. Under the direction of AHRQ staff, the NRC provides direct technical assistance and consulting services to AHRQ projects involved in developing, testing, and using health IT applications. In doing so, the NRC is helping AHRQ to build the nation's capacity across health care settings - large and small, urban and frontier - for the effective use of health IT. In addition, through the development of a web presence, the NRC helps AHRQ serve as the link between the health care community at large and the researchers and experts who are on the front lines of health IT. By assisting AHRQ in developing a central repository for lessons learned from AHRQ's health IT initiative, the NRC assists in encouraging the adoption of health IT to improve quality, safety and efficiency by disseminating the latest tools, best practices, and research results.   By providing direct technical assistance to AHRQ's health IT projects and supporting effective dissemination of lessons learned, the NRC maximizes the benefit of the Agency's investment in health IT.  The NRC helps AHRQ support its grantees, contractors, and federal partners  through a variety of services including: providing technical assistance and consultative support; serving as a repository for best practices,  developing, synthesizing, and disseminating executable knowledge for clinicians and patients; facilitating communication and sharing of ideas among grantees; organizing and leading educational activities; and developing and disseminating tools to help providers and organizations utilize health IT to improve patient safety and quality of care in their communities. The NRC assists the Agency by serving as a link among the grantees and contractors of health IT program. The NRC also assists the Agency in planning and implementing program and initiative evaluations and by collecting and aggregating research findings and synthesizing new knowledge about health IT for multiple audiences.  The NRC has provided the Agency with additional expertise in multiple areas including health IT standards, hardware and software, financing, sustainability strategies, and privacy and security.
Given the success of the initial NRC, AHRQ has committed to continuing this effort through this solicitation of multiple master contracts.  The AHRQ Health IT Program envisions that the next phase of activities for the NRC will focus on driving use and satisfaction of the NRC presence and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of developing, synthesizing, and disseminating information for the program’s diverse stakeholders, including researchers, implementers and decision-makers.

<p>1) Radio Frequency (RF) Sensors<br />2) Electro-Optical (EO) Sensors<br />3) RF Electronic Warfare (EW)<br />4) EO Battlespace Access<br />5) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)/Performance Driven Sensing<br />6) Enabling Sensor Devices/Components<br />7) Trusted Collaborative Sensing</p>
<p>This strategy will provide AFRL/RY an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs as ever-changing technology issues are identified.</p>
<p>The BAA will remain "open" for 5 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during calls. Each call will identify solicitation topics and contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission. Proposal receipt after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Calls for proposals (made by amendments to this BAA) will occur periodically throughout the life of this over-arching BAA. Each call will: (1) identify specific technology development topics within the seven major CTCs; (2) identify any changes to the standard evaluation criteria or proposal preparation instructions, and; (3) contain common cutoff dates for proposal submissions.<br /><br />It is anticipated that solicitations issued under this BAA will be unrestricted.

<DESC>The FAA Academy located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK will train many of the new air traffic controllers in addition to the 4,000+ technical and managerial training courses currently being taught by various media types each year at the center.  The FAA Academy currently provides four training shifts to accommodate the influx of students attending, and scheduled to attend training at the MMAC.  This 75% increase is attributed to an increase in new hire air traffic control students.  The length of training for these students has introduced challenges to the Academy that consists of locating long term lodging within an established budget (comparable to student costs based upon FAA Travel Policy extended-stay fixed rate per diem).  To fulfill future long term lodging needs for Academy students, the FAA Academy is considering contract services to facilitate extended stay-lodging with related amenities.  The  services are anticipated for the period beginning third quarter 2009.
The Contract services shall provide lodging (and related accommodations) to facilitate a minimum of 300 rooms annually (365 days a year).  Lodging and accomodations will be provided for new hire air traffic control students only.  Contract facilities located within a 10 mile radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73169, and  lodging standards equivalent to AAA - Three Diamond (http://www.aaa.com) are preferred.

On Demand for a Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) would occur during a period July 6 through September18, 2009, though these dates could change when listed in the solicitation, and Call When Needed (CWN) during the other time periods in the base year and each option year.

The solicitation may, or may not, request two quotes/offers, one using the Jefferson County (JEFFCO) Airport USDA Rocky Mountain Air-tanker Base (10900 West 120th Ave., Broomfield, CO) as the designated base and the other quote/offer using the contractor's home or other contractor base location to determine the best cost advantage to the government.

<a href="mailto:debra.buckley@navy.mil">contract specialist</a>
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2).  This announcement is open until 01 February 2009.  NAVFAC ESC is interested in a non-mechanical fastener technology and methodology to attach thin-film photovoltaic (PV) panels to a concrete roof that is capable of withstanding Guam weather conditions, including typhoon winds of up to 200 mph.  Furthermore, the technology and methodology shall be compatible with roof coatings that are used on concrete roofs. Work under this award will be conducted in two phases. Phase I is to develop and validate the technology and methodology under controlled conditions, such as in a laboratory environment. Phase II is to field test a fully functional system in Guam. Each phase will be negotiated and awarded separately.
The announcement for this award is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pages of technical material. The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant to this announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit. The award will be made for Phase I only and is estimated for up to $450K. Abstract emphasis should be on the Phase I effort with the subsequent phase identified more broadly. Multiple awards may be made under this announcement. Topics of interest described below are provided as guides to areas that may be included in the abstract for the various phases. It is not expected that any individual abstract will include all topics, nor is it expected that abstracts limit their approach to only the areas specified in the topic list. Individual topics of interest are as follows: (a) Identify a technology and methodology for attaching PV panels to a concrete roof. Imp! act(s) to the cost of installation should be considered. (b) Thin-film PV panels generally have a product warranty of at least 20 years. The technology and methodology for attaching them to the roof should also be capable of having a similar warranty and/or be capable of maintained such that it endures for 20 years. (c) Areas of the roof not protected by the PV panels may need to be reapplied. Protecting the proposed technology, methodology, and PV system from damage during re-coating of the roof should be considered. (d) Maintenance on PV systems are relatively minimal. However, some PV panels can still fail. Ease of disengaging and reapplying the proposed technology and methodology may reduce the system's life cycle costs. (e) Testing standards, such as IEC 61646 and IEEE 1262, are commonly used to test PV modules. Any proposed technology and methodology should be capable of passing these types of tests.
A NAVFAC ESC technical review board will evaluate the abstracts to this BAA. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA (listed in descending order of importance): (1) the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract; (2) the contractor's capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractor's proposed objectives; (3) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract; (4) the cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach, and (5) the applicability of the conclusions to guidance and criteria. Subsequent to review, the NAVFAC ESC Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) may request a full scale Proposal of no more than 25 pages. NAVFAC ESC may share the abstracts and the proposals with other Dept. of Defense (DOD) personnel of offices associa! ted with this topic. Information that is sensitive or proprietary must so be marked page by page in the abstract and or proposal. Multiple awards may be made. The request for a proposal does not obligate the government in awarding a contract. CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR). NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR. THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227-2423, OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV. THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE NAVY EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE CONTRACTOR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD. ONLY A WARRANTED CONTRACTING OFFICER CAN OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT. Any information that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted. Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors, who have submitted an abstract, after the Navy's TEB has r! eviewed all abstracts submitted by an internal periodic cut-off date. The internal periodic cut-off date may occur several times within the period from the BAA announcement to the closing date for receipt of abstracts. Abstracts may be submitted at any time, but to ensure review by the TEB, abstracts should be received by 09 February 2009. Abstracts received after this date may or may not be evaluated by the TEB and will be dependent upon the results of the evaluations and budgetary constraints. For technical questions regarding this BAA, contact Peter Ly by telephone at (805) 982-1367 or via e-mail at peter.ly@navy.mil. Abstract submittals to this BAA should be submitted on a single CD-ROM, in MS Word .doc format, or Adobe .pdf format along with 3 printed hard copies. Packages shall be mailed via USPS, UPS, or FedEx to:PETER LYNAVFAC ESC PW2221100 23RD AVENUEPORT HUENEME, CA 93043

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:richard.macklin2@va.gov">Contracting Officer Richard Macklin</a>
<DESC>1. Title of Project:  Automated Reporting and Workflow system for Enterprise Denial Management (EDMP)2. Background:  The Veterans Health Administration's  (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) is responsible for developing a denial management system to 1) identify, 2) monitor and 3) assist in the processing of primary and secondary claims that are                  denied payment.  Third-party denials are the number-one cause for non-payment and/or underpayment.   Until recently, providers did not have the ability to identify, report or process denials on a consistent basis because insurance companies use different adjudication systems and payment reporting techniques.  With the advent of Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the ASC X12N 835 for Health Care Claim Payment/Remitance Advice, providers have the ability to capture and organize denial information in a systemic fashion.  Utilizing technology enables providers to better identify root causes for denials, accelerate the resubmission of denied claims and eventually reduce the amount of revenue written-off as a result of timely filing, medical necessity and eligibility related denials.  At this time, the CBO is interested in moving towards identifying supporting solutions for 1) identifying, 2) monitoring, and 3) reworking denied claims.3.  Scope of Work:  The system will capture third-party Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) (and/or remittance advices) that are received electronically using the HIPAA ASC X12N 835 format.  By capturing and analyzing 835 transactions, the technology component will translate complex data structures into meaningful business reports by payer, denial category, denial type and source of denial within a provider or provider department.  The system will also provide for distributed reporting capability and security among multi-users; provide reporting flexibility at both a summary and detail level to include sorting and parsing of data by the end user; support the importing of user data into multiple packages (e.g. excel, acrobat, etc.); generate reports by health plan to allow for payer performance analysis and provide user defined database fields.In addition, CBO requires Contractor services that provide the use of their technology, classroom instruction in the use of system output, and support for the use of such technology by multiple users and multiple organizational levels.  Training should enable the VHA staff to produce reports, utilize workflow tools and have a thorough understanding of the specific HIPAA ASC X12N 835 standards, terms and data elements.  CBO requires system follow up support including:	Telephone and modem support to answer coding questions and resolve technical problemsRevisions and system updates should be supplied on a timely basis to stay current with industry standards.  Such program modifications may include, but not be limited to, third-party revisions to Medicare and non-Medicare denial categories.  4. Performance Period: The period of performance (POP) shall be from date of award for a period of 12 months.   5.	Type of Contract:  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Task Order

Pittsburgh IAP ARS Water Distribution System:

Potable water is supplied to the 911th AW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 12-inch main. The water is metered and then delivered into the distribution system through the base’s 8-inch main. The average pressure supplied to the Base is 90 psi. The 911th AW provides no additional treatment, and the Base has no active potable water wells. Water storage is provided by a 1.5-million gallon elevated water storage tank, which is located on-base but owned and operated by the MTMA. The elevated storage tank is supplied through a 16-inch main, which is also owned by MTMA. The elevated storage tank serves both the local community and the installation, and the MTMA reserves 300,000 gallons of water exclusively for the base’s fire protection requirements. An additional ground-level tank stores 165,000 gallons of water used only for fire protection of two flightline facilities. The Base water distribution system is government-owned and consists of approximately 23,685 linear feet of water mains and service laterals. The majority of the mains were upgraded in the mid-1990’s with polyvinyl chloride (PVC); the remaining original system is ductile iron. Most of the base’s original system was abandoned in place during the upgrade. Most of the 911th AW water lines distribution water through a looped system; however, the system has some dead-end lines. The water distribution system is generally in excellent condition. Flow volume is good, and system pressures are well balanced. Pressures at the fire hydrants are consistently in the 90-100 psi range with good flow. Vales, which are generally older than the distribution lines, are all accessible and in good operating condition. There are no known code violations. There are 58 facilities on the Base of which only 6 are metered.

Pittsburgh IAP ARS Natural Gas Distribution System:

Peoples Natural Gas Company supplies natural gas to the 911th AW. Gas is brought to the Base through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe operating at 40 psi. The 6-inch supply line enters the Base southeast of the main gate and runs parallel along Defense Avenue to the metering station located at Building 119. At the metering station, pressure is reduced to 10 psi, and then distributed to Base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4-inches. Thirty-two buildings have gas meters installed. The existing 15,826 LF of pipe is polyethylene, some of which has been inserted in the original steel lines. The remaining polyethylene pipe has a tracer wire to facilitate locating this pipe. The metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only point where pressure is reduced. Peoples Natural Gas owns all natural gas lines and the meter and regulator system to the point of pressure reduction; 911th AW assumes ownership of the gas lines on the “low-side” of the reducing station. Plastic isolation valves located at each building and throughout the system enable portions to be isolated for maintenance. The system was extensively replaced in FY 1991. No code violations were observed during the site visit, and the system is in good condition.

Pittsburgh IAP ARS Wastewater Treatment System:

Wastewater generated by 911th AW is carried off base through a 15-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, and disposed of through Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) sanitary sewer lines and sewage treatment facility. Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the Base is billed for sewage treatment fees based upon 100 per cent of its potable water consumption. Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system. The Base system meets all known regulatory requirements, and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements. The 911th AW wastewater collection system consists of approximately 8,020 feet of clay pipe and 7,000 feet of PVC pipe, both gravity-flow.  The collection system includes laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains. The Base has no lift stations and the oil/water separators are not part of this contract. Service laterals are typically 4- to 6-inches in diameter; mains range from 6- to 8-inches. The wastewater collection system is generally in fair condition. Most of the system is original and has not been lined, but the base’s terrain and slopes provide for adequate flow, and base personnel report no problems with blockages or backups.

Pittsburgh IAP ARS Electrical Distribution System:

Exelon Energy and Duquesne Light supply the electrical power to the Pittsburgh ARS, Pittsburgh IAP, through two primary distribution lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company. Exelon Energy supplies 68 percent of the electricity while Duquesne Light supplies 32 percent of the required electrical power. The primary source originates at Duquesne’s Mountour substation approximately four miles ease of the Base and delivers 17,055 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) via 22.9 kilovolt (KV) overhead transmission lines. The primary is stepped down at the Base substation to 4.16 kV to feed the Base primary. An alternate source begins at the Russell Burdsall and Ward substation located three miles north of the Base, and delivers 10,313 kVA through 22.9kV overhead transmission lines. Duquesne Light’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 212). Automatic sectionalizing switches control the two circuits, providing automatic switching capability in the event of a power outage. A three-phase 1500kV transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160Volt (V) primary distribution for the Base. Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with two 1200 Amp vacuum switches protecting two 4160V feeders. From the substation, a combination overhead/underground system serves the majority of the base facilities. Base drawings show approximately 24,000 SCLF overhead cables and 72,000 SCLF of underground cables, including lighting. All of the PCB-contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced. The system also includes the following: (1) 59 transformers ranging from 10 kVA to 750 kVA; (2) 81 utility poles of various heights; and (3) 14 switches (2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-way). There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system. However, the Base has programmed a Demand Side Energy Reduction initiative that will provide load shedding of building air conditioning systems when a preset demand level is reached. The substation was constructed in the mid-1950’s and upgraded in the late 70’s. The underground circuits are newer, with construction dates ranging from the mid-1980’s to present. Equipment such as transformers average in age from 25 years for pole-mounted and 5 years for those on pads. The underground cables are relatively new being installed in the 1990’s. The existing Duquesne-owned substation is operating at its maximum capacity, and the base-owned switchgear is weak, requiring the base to restore power incrementally after outages. The distribution system is generally in fair condition, and the positioning of switches throughout the system provides a degree of backup from one circuit to another. A number of utility poles require replacement, as do some of the strain reliefs. The Base has total of 58 facilities of which 16 are metered.

<DESC><p>The Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) program office intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of 2 additional SBIRS Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites (GEO 5 &amp; 6). GEO 5 &amp; 6 are anticipated to be derivatives of the existing designs developed under the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development Contract with minimal modifications. The SBIRS program office anticipates releasing the RFP in early Fiscal Year 2010 with a contract award in early Fiscal Year 2011. No firm decisions have been made to fund GEO 5&amp;6 at this time. The program office has been directed to add undefinitized, Not-To-Exceed options to the current SBIRS contract which procured GEO 3 &amp; 4. The planned contract type will be Fixed Price.
<p>The current SBIRS contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), Sunnyvale, CA. It is anticipated that this effort will be awarded to LMSSC as a sole source award.</p>
<p>The government's acquisition strategy is to build nearly identical replicas of the GEO 3 &amp; 4 units. However, the government recognizes minor design changes will be required to accommodate parts and material obsolescence and new government-directed design changes.</p>
<p>GEO 5 &amp; 6 are intended to continue deployment of the full SBIRS High constellation. The new GEO satellites must integrate with the existing ground operations and maintenance support infrastructure with minimal changes.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they have the capability to perform as a prime contractor in support of this production effort and deliver a fully integrated system solution may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC), which must include the following information: Personnel/Size Standard - Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification, Large, Small, or Other, and experience-specific work previously performed or work performed which is relevant to this follow-on effort. Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate. The small business size standard (Number of employees) for this requirement is 1,000 under NAICS Code 336414. If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities please indicate this fact clearly in your submission. The SOC shall not exceed ten pages. The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. Verbal responses will not be accepted. The cover letter must contain an Executive Summary. All responses must be signed, scanned, and submitted by e-mail to the POCs listed below in MS Word or PDF format.</p>

Increasing rates of chronic diseases among Navajo people in Shiprock Service Unit are often related to changes in exercise and nutrition habits and patterns over the last 50 - 100 years.  The lack of availability of wellness and exercise facilities is a significant factor in the current epidemic of obesity faced by Navajo people.

	In addition, current high death rates of motor vehicle crashes and intentional injuries related to high rates of alcohol and substance abuse among local young people have been related to lack of positive available opportunities.

Any proprietary information submitted in response to this sources sought notice should be marked.  This is only a sources sought notice, and no solicitation is available at this time. Please see the SOW below for further details. 
Statement of Work:
Background:Cochlear implants have been widely used to restore a sense of sound to users that were profoundly deaf, with more than 100,000 devices in use worldwide.  Commercial implants operate by electrical stimulation of surviving portions of the auditory nerve through an electrode array placed in the scala tympani of the cochlea. The major limitation of this approach, however, is the broad spread of neural excitation that is derived from electrodes placed within the cochlea.  
Significant gains in auditory ability are likely to be obtained by increasing the number of spectral channels and dynamic range of each stimulating electrode. Recent animal studies utilizing a novel intraneural stimulating electrode have produced clear evidence that robust and frequency-specific responses can be driven through an intraneural implant design. This approach could also provide a means to stimulate the auditory nerve of patients with cochlear pathologies that preclude insertion of an electrode array into the scala tympani. All of these features are likely to provide important gains in user perception if a device safe for human use can be constructed around this concept. 
Now that acute animal studies have established the restricted nature of excitation, chronic animal studies are needed to investigate safety issues. Interactions with surgical experts and medical device designers are required to develop this concept into a device optimized for use in patients with hearing loss.
Objective:Design intraneural electrode arrays for use in a multichannel prostheses that can be inserted directly into the human auditory nerve and perform animal studies that assess safety and efficacy of this approach.
Work to be performed:A. Utilize the cat (Felis catus) auditory nerve as the animal model of the human auditory nerve during its course from the modiolus to the cochlear nucleus. Previous research for development of neural prostheses for auditory neural pathways has provided a significant body of scientific literature describing sound and electrical evoked activity in this animal.
B. Design appropriate electrode configurations for electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Multiple stimulation sites shall be provided on each electrode shank, since this design maximizes the number of electrode sites across electrode insertions. Additional configurations of stimulating electrodes and novel forms of neural stimulation beyond electrical currents can be proposed to add merit to the proposal.
C. Select at least two implantation sites within the animal models auditory nerve that mimic candidate locations for chronic electrode placement in human subjects. Additional implantation sites may be utilized to facilitate access to the nerve tissue for later histological analysis. Interactions with surgical experts and implant fabricators are expected to develop optimal approaches for use of this technology in patient populations with hearing loss.
D. Utilize multichannel electrode arrays with recording sites distributed across the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) to record single and multiple unit activity as driven by electrical stimulation through the intraneural electrode array. Perform acute and chronic neurophysiological animal studies to quantify functional capabilities and safety concerns of the proposed stimulating electrode designs and placement strategies. 1. Determine the ability of intraneural electrodes to stimulate restricted populations of auditory nerve fibers at low stimulus levels.2. Determine the approximate number of fibers activated as a function of stimulus level from neural thresholds up to maximal levels that can be safely applied to nerve tissue during chronic use.3. Quantify differences in the neural populations activated based on the placement of the stimulating sites in different regions of the nerve.4. Quantify temporal features of the electrically driven neural response, and compare these results to the capabilities needed to provide enhanced benefit from a neural prosthesis. 5. Assess capabilities for simultaneous stimulation of more than one electrode to provide enhanced benefits from a neural prosthesis.6. Additional studies that develop and assess novel capabilities available from intraneural stimulation can be proposed to add merit to the proposal.
E. Chronic studies shall be performed in the animal model to provide preclinical data and address any safety concerns arising from use of an intraneural electrode array. At a minimum, these studies shall include chronic stimulation of a statistically appropriate number of animals at suprathreshold levels for periods of at least 60 hours per week over a two month period. Where advantageous, this activity should make use of hardware and software developed under the NIDCD contract, Open Architecture Research Interface for Cochlear Implants.
F. Upon completion of chronic stimulation, histopathologic assessment of the auditory nerve tissue near  the electrode contacts shall be conducted to determine the presence of tissue damage due to:1. passive implantation with non-stimulated control electrodes.2. chronic stimulation at suprathreshold levels. 
G. Upon analysis of the results from the animal studies, determine the safety and effectiveness of a chronic intraneural electrode array(s) in the animal model. Suggest further studies for the development of a safe and effective intraneural auditory prosthesis for human use.
H. Technological Resource Sharing. The Contractor shall provide engineering documentation for technological resources developed in the course of performing the project, such as electronic circuit schematics, printed circuit board layout specifications, and software source code.
I. Publish research data in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
Data acquired during performance of the project shall be fully analyzed to determine important trends and subsequently published in the peer-reviewed literature. At least one submission for peer-review in a scientific journal is required on an annual basis to provide a timely review of the ongoing research and wide dissemination of the results.
Required Travel:The Contractor shall travel to national scientific meetings on an annual basis to present recent findings of the studies performed under the contract in conjunction with PIs from other NIDCD Neural Prosthesis Development awards. The semiannual Conference on Implantable Auditory Prostheses and the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology are typically candidates for these meetings. Offerors should estimate two persons traveling for four days per year.
Deliverables:In addition to those reports required by the other terms of this contract, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Government the following reports/deliverables in the manner and number specified below:
A.Quarterly Progress ReportThe Quarterly Progress Report shall consist of an abstract summarizing activity followed by a brief description of the work performed during the previous quarter and the anticipated work plan for the coming quarter.

<CONTACT>MICHAEL BROOMFIELD401-832-8469LORI ROSARIO401-832-1487
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required. However, the NECO webpage serves as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.
In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this is a Request for Information (RFI). The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to aid the United States Navy in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a competitive procurement for the production of Modular Infrared Sensor Assemblies.  The sensor assembly consists of a 3-5 micron infrared camera housed in a pressure-proof module located above the Type 8 periscope.  The Type 8 periscope with the sensor assembly is installed on the 688 and SSN 21 Class submarines. 
The purpose of the Modular Infrared Sensor (IR Module) Assembly is to provide a Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) sensor that permits recognition and classification of targets in tactical maritime operations. The IR Module consist of an infrared camera and cryogenic cooler, camera control electronics, narrow and wide field optics (2.3 H x 1.7 V and 6.4 H x 4.8 V degrees), focus, power change controls and an infrared head mirror with elevation controls. The top of the IR Module replicates the same mechanical and electrical interfaces to the EHF SATCOM Antenna and EW Carriage used by the Type 8 Mod 3. The IR Module also uses the same nitrogen purge and fill valve design used by the Type 8 Mod 3. IR Module shall be a separable unit that mates on top of the Type 8 Periscope Visual Head. The module has a diameter of 7.5 inches and is 23.6 inches high.  The overall length between the optical and infrared lines-of-sight shall not exceed 24 inches. The lower disconnect of the Sensor!  Housing shall be a low pressure barrier that mates to the Visual Head Assembly to functionally interconnect the electrical leads and waveguide routed to the EHF SATCOM Antenna, EW Carriage, and Infrared imaging components. Both the infrared chamber and EW chamber of the Assembly shall provide for nitrogen purge and fill operations. When the lower disconnect of the Sensor Housing is mated to the new Visual Head, a high-pressure (1000 + 50/-0 psi) hydrostatic  boundary shall be formed. The IR Camera line of sight shall be varied from 60 degrees above and 10 degrees below the horizon. Focus shall be between Near (50 meters or less) and Infinity. The IR Module power will be 115 Volts 400 Hz. One goal should be an increase over the current IR system resolution by 25 percent or more. The present camera has a pixel count of 640 x 480 and the current pixel size is 28 microns square. It is allowable to use FPA's (Focal Plane Array ) that have greater than 640 x 480 pixel counts and!  pixels that are smaller than 28 microns in order to achieve the goal of 25 percent better resolution. However, the resolution should not be increased at the sacrifice of NETD (Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference).
Detailed technical drawings are available, however due to the restricted distribution statements, the drawings will not be posted with this RFI. In order to receive a copy of the drawings, your company must be certified under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP). Send an e-mail request for the drawings to Michael Broomfield at michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil citing RFI N66604-09-R-1187 with your company name, address, JCP and cage code number, telephone number and point of contact. CD-ROMs will be sent once JCP registration is confirmed. Information on JCP registration is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/faq.aspx . All drawing requests must be submitted prior to 16 Jan 2009.
This RFI is intended to gather information regarding possible technical solutions and their characteristics.  NUWCDIVNPT's goal is to use the information collected to develop an acquisition strategy for a competitive best value acquisition. NUWCDIVNPT requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, affordability, weight, size and power requirements of the proposed approach. Responses should be limited to five pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a soli! citation based on responses received. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by NUWCDIVNPT from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Failure to respond to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  In order to comply with scheduling priorities, responders are asked to provide responses by no later than close of business (COB) Feb 12, 2009. RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to: Mr. David Saleem, Code 3432, NUWCDIVNPT, 1176 Howell Street, Newport, RI, 02841. e-mail david.saleem@navy.mil.

<DESC><BR>Description:  PEO STRI Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Assistant Product Manager (APM) for Live Training Transformation (LT2) Consolidated Product-Line Management (CPM) approach focuses on the requirements, execution, and management for the synchronization of a multi-phased, multi-thread Product Line.<BR><BR>CPM is the framework by which Product Managers (PdM) will execute control of a systems life cycle to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based.  CPM is the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of PM products.  It enables managers to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems for which they are responsible throughout the life cycle of that system.   <BR><BR>The process by which PM TRADE manages products must be deliberate, disciplined and coordinated in order to maximize re-use of components and products in the development of new systems, synchronize the production of products to gain efficiencies, facilitates technology refresh and obsolescence/retrofit efforts, enable supporting efforts, and to maintain seamless interoperability between components, products and systems.  <BR><BR>CPM provides LT2 the mechanisms and processes to achieve a holistic consolidated approach to managing disparate products and elements within the product line.  CPM provides the means for development, integration, and sustainment.  CPM is the life-cycle implementation mechanism for LT2. (Refer to Appendix C, CPM Core Functionalities, of Attachment A, Draft Statement of Work, for functions included within the CPM scope)<BR><BR><BR>1.  The anticipated nature and complexity of the work tasks  (ranging from software development to product line configuration management) associated with the CPM requires mature and established processes; and therefore a level 4 CMMI rating. (Refer to Attachment A for a Draft copy of the Statement of Work)<BR><BR>2.  Security Requirements regarding software development and potential access to secure information will limit the CPM effort to US companies/citizens only.<BR><BR>3.  The intent of this Market Research is to:<BR>a.	Determine which companies may have potential interest in competing for the CPM effort.<BR>b.	Determine whether or not the CPM functionality already exists via COTS/NDI solutions. <BR>c.	Solicit comments and feedback from industry regarding the draft/initial requirements and capabilities being sought for CPM, including opinions on the viability of the approach and strategy.<BR>d.	Solicit brief capabilities statements from interested parties regarding these high level requirements.<BR><BR>4.

<p style="text-align: left;">The Office of Land Warfare &amp; Munitions, under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, in conjuntion with the DoD Services and Agencies involved in weapon research, development, and testing, are pursuing the development of robust and reliable data recorder technologies for use in weapon development testing, including weapon sled and flight tests.&nbsp; Past history with data recorders has shown that it is very difficult to manufacture a reliable and survivable data recorder for the harsh environments experienced by weapons during gun, sled, and flight tests.&nbsp; The primary environment of interest is the axial and lateral acceleration environment of the weapon and components.&nbsp; However, there is also interest in other applicable environmental sensors (e.g. spin, strain, displacement) that may have applicability to measuring and recording the response of the weapon, explosives or its components during testing.&nbsp; The purpose of this announcement is to announce the Data Recorder Worshop and obtain a listing of companies interested in attending.&nbsp; The workshop is currently planned for February 24-25, 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The DoD Fuze community is interested in receiving input from industry and academia regarding the current state of recorder technology including packaging and manufacturing methods for recorders and instrumentation packages utilized in harsh environments.&nbsp; As such, the workshop format is structured to enable government, industry, and academic organizations to present their state-of-the-art technological solutions for harsh environment instrumentation systems during the first day.&nbsp; A general overview of DoD interest in this area will be presented at the beinning of the first day.&nbsp; Note, all presentation materials and discussions during the first day of the workshop will be limited to public releasable/cleared information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second day of the workshop will be limited to DoD, DOE, and DoD Contractor personnel to enable break-out sessions relevant to current and future technology challenges for DoD specific applications.&nbsp; These sessions will incorporate a more detailed government synopsis of recent issues associated with recording data in the extreme shock environments of sled and flight tests.&nbsp; This session will help in the planning of future government development efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organizations interested in attending the Workshop must provide the following information to the point of contact listed below NLT January 23, 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1.&nbsp; Company information including company name, address and a main point of contact with phone number and email address.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Contracting Center (USRDECOMCC) intends to issue on a sole source basis a modification for 75,000 Improved Outer Tactical Vests. Specialty Defense (SD) and Point Blank Body Armor (PBBA) are the only two sources that have US Army tested and approved ballistic material packages.  A Request for Proposal (RFP), W91CRB-07-R-0079, was issued on 30 November 2007 for 736,000 IOTVs.  Due to numerous delays award is now estimated to be April 2009.  As a result of the required need for continual production of the IOTVs to support the ongoing fielding requirements until deliveries from the subsequent full and open competition commence, a need to modify one of the contracts for the procurement of 75,000 IOTVs will be required.  The modification of one of the contracts will be awarded based upon the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is based on SD and PBBA being the only two sources that have US Army tested and approved ballistic material packages, proven producers of the IOTV, and the manufacturing capabilities to meet the current IOTV production and performance requirements.  The modification of one of the existing contracts for a total of 75,000 IOTVs at the rate of 25,000 IOTVs produced per month for three months, will be awarded based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  The USRDECOMCC point of contact for this action is Mitzi Wall, telephone 410-278-0868, email:  mitzi.wall@us.army.mil.  Any questions as a result of this posting shall be submitted in writing and emailed to the above listed address.

<DESC>The purpose of this sole-source synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on the Enterprise Information Technology Contract (EITC) supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  The EITC was awarded under full and open competition in April 2002 as a Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with an anticipated period of performance through March 2011.  The contract provides critical Information Technology (IT) support to HQ USSOCOM, its Components, Theater Special Operation Commands (TSOCs) and the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps) that have or provide direct support to Special Operations Forces (SOF).  The work performed by the contractors includes, but is not limited to, Local Area Network Administration, Network Management, Disaster Recovery, Helpdesk, IT Planning, Integration, Information Assurance, Configuration Management, Infrastructure, Hardware Maintenance, Desktop, IT Training, Web/Portal Administration and Development, Database Administration and Development, Application Development, Transmission Security, Technology Refreshment, and spare/repair parts.  To continue this critical support, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of this contract from $900M to $1.3B.  The proposed contract action does not extend the current period of performance.  This action is due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to the expansion of USSOCOM’s operational tempo as it prosecutes the Global War On Terror.  One or more competitive procurements are anticipated as future follow-ons to this contract. The contractor is L-3 Services Inc.; contract number USZA22-02-D-0017.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all responses received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p><br />________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. <br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Website at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to support the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) requirement by providing a single Universal Serial Bus (USB) IDM interface cable capable of supporting dual channels in order to support digital Close Air Support for Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties. A critical link in the dismounted digital Close Air Support chain of Air Force Tactical Air Control Party is a rugged, small, light weight, and low power portable computer that utilizes a PC Integrated Data Modem (IDM) to interface with Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), High Frequency (HF), and SATCOM radios. Currently, the interface between the computers and the Integrated Data Modem is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot. Many computers in this class lack PCMCIA support and eventually the PCMCIA slots will become obsolete asthe computer industry is moving to other interface methods.  See Note 26.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Organizational Experience
Organizational Past Performance
Key Personnel
Price

Organizational Experience, Organizational Past Performance, and Key Personnel, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-28.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Cryostat for Measurement of single-electron tunneling (SET) devices to be used in Atomic Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

BACKGROUND
NIST has an ongoing program to investigate nano-electronic SET devices, for applications in metrology and quantum information. The measurements require low, controllable temperatures.  In order to expand NIST's measurement capability, a temperature scanning measurement system is required. This will allow measurement over a wide range of temperatures and will allow characterization of a large number of samples by virtue of a much faster turnaround time.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Each, Cryostat for Measurement of SET Devices

Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum required technical specifications:

Ability to scan temperatures from 5 K to 300 K

Cryogens: This system shall be Cryo-cooled, and not require any external cryogenic fluids for regular operation.  It is acceptable if, on an infrequent basis, the operators need to replenish He gas.

Turnaround time: six hours or less.  

Size of sample space: We require a sample space (empty volume in vacuum) of at least 3 inches diameter by 6 inches of length.

Electrical feedthroughs: A total of 24 electrical leads are required.  The Offeror may provide these leads through multiple connectors.  The Offeror shall provide spare parts of cable connectors that mate to the cryostat connectors; the total number of such spare part cable connectors shall be three times the number of cryostat connectors.

Total size: the total volume and mass of the cryostat and any ancillary equipment shall be as small as possible, with a maximum size of 3 cubic meters for all parts, and a maximum mass of 35 kg for the cryostat itself (excluding ancillaries).

Manual controls: To the extent that this system is designed to be operated in conjunction with a computer, there shall be a parallel set of manual controls that allow full operation of the system without any computer whatsoever.

Unattended time: It shall be possible for the system to run for two days without operator intervention.

A full set of mechanical drawings and manuals shall be included.

To the extent that any metric fittings are used in the assembly, the Contractor shall supply a set of spare metric bolts, nuts, and washers.  The spare bolts shall be identical in size and shape to those used in the system. The Contractor shall supply at least 50 of each of the spare bolts, nuts, and washers.

As part of the proposal, the Offeror shall submit the following information:

1.	A description of the steps necessary and concomitant times necessary, to warm the sample up to room temperature, change samples, and then cool the new sample back down to base temperature.
2.	An approximate sketch of overall dimensions and weight.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in Indiana seeks the services of a licensed, independent real estate professional, such as an agent, broker or appraiser licensed and registered in the State of Indiana to conduct an area wide market analysis or survey on sales prices of properties comparable to the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) easement properties. The survey will be based on values of comparable sales in the areas covered by the market analysis/survey. 



The independent real estate professional shall have at least three (3) years experience, as an agent, broker or licensed appraiser and be knowledgeable of the dynamics of vacant and/or agricultural land sales in the State of Indiana in order to make required judgments based upon the data available. Acceptable certification includes but is not limited to the following designations: Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, Accredited Land Consultant (ALC), USPAP, etc. 



The requested market analysis work is not the traditional WRP appraisal requested in the past. The intent is not to put the deliverables to the review process provided an appraisal, but to obtain an independent, professional opinion of the fair market value of the land that would typically be included in enrolment into the WRP. The market analysis result will consist of a cropland value and a non-cropland value for each Market Area (Region) in the format of a final report and supporting documentation.  


This is a total small business set aside NAICS code 531320 with a size standard of $2.0M.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Exposure Research Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC (RTP), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, on a fixed price basis, intends to purchase a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer for the continuous identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air.  The Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer shall comply with the specifications listed below.
A.	MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS: The instrument must be able to detect these VOCs with low-pptv (parts per trillion by volume) sensitivity and must be capable of high mass resolution.   
 The instrument will be extensively used for identification and quantification of VOCs in both field and laboratory settings where concentrations of the VOCs may range widely from sub-ppbv (parts per billion by volume) to ppmv (parts per million by volume) levels. This instrument will therefore need to maintain linearity over several orders of magnitude.  The Proton Tansfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer shall meet the following specifications:
a)	The system must operate with no carrier gas to deliver or analyze air samples.
b)	The system must use soft ionization of the target compounds using water as the ionizing agent (H3O+ ions).  
c)	The system must be capable of a minimum sensitivity level of 5 pptv (parts per trillion by volume).  
d)	The system must have a linear response range from 5 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) to > 1 ppmv (parts per million by volume).
e)	The system must achieve a minimum mass resolution of 1 amu (atomic mass unit).
f)	The system must have a minimum mass range of 1 ? 512 amu. 
g)	The system must have a response time of at least 100 ms (milliseconds).
h)	The system must have a measuring time of 2 ms/amu to 60s/amu.
i)	The system must include a heated inlet capable of maintaining an inlet temperature of 150oC.
j)	The system must fit in a ?limited? space of 60 cm wide by 90 cm high and 80 cm deep.

GSA Design Excellence Solicitation
C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS11P09MKC0022 

Region: Region 11
City: Washington, DC
Contracting Officer: Vincent E. Matner, P.E. 
Contract Specialist:  Chrischanda S. Smith
Phone Number: 202-358-3573

PROJECT:  Commons/Health Care Building Project 
BUILDING TYPE:  Senior Living Facility
CLIENT AGENCY: Armed Forces Retirement Home 
SIZE: Approximately 200,000 gross square feet
BUDGET:  $58 million to $68 million

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption.  

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, including the P100 [Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service].  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, including standards mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 2005, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). 

The GSA, National Capital Region, Washington, DC, is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services for the Bridging Design of a new Commons/Health Care Building(s).  The Commons/Health Care Building (s) will include a Long Term Care and Memory Support Facility and a Commons Building.  These buildings will be located in the same general area of the Scott and Sheridan buildings, with sensitivity to the historic campus.  The estimated project construction cost range is $58 million to $68 million including furnishing, fixtures and equipment (FFE).  This construction cost range excludes the cost of the design effort in the proposed Bridging Design-Build contract.

GSA anticipates using the Bridging Design-Build method of project delivery.  Therefore, the overall design effort under this solicitation, such as architectural and MEP for the new buildings, will be to the Bridging (35%) Design Development level. Some components, however, such as interior layouts and fixtures may be designed to near completion.   Additionally, transitional work may be designed to 100% CD documents if needed to maintain the schedule.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Scott project will include (but is not limited to) the following elements:
1)	Construction of one or more new buildings in the same general area as the Scott and Sheridan Buildings.
2)	Alteration of the adjacent Sheridan building for transitional work, to enable resident’s ease of movement amongst it and the new buildings, and to retrofit existing rooms for Assisted Living.  
3)	Design associated site and landscaping work to integrate and link the Commons/Health Care Building with the existing buildings and the historic campus.

The Long Term Care and Memory Support building will accommodate 72 residents. It will be approximately 60,000 to 70,000 square feet.  The new “Commons” Building will be approximately 110,000 to 130,000 square feet and will include the following components:  
•	Kitchen 
•	Administrative offices
•	Dining room
•	Canteen
•	Hall of Honors
•	Wellness clinic
•	Bank and/or Credit union
•	Library
•	Multipurpose Rooms
•	Card rooms
•	Game rooms
•	Other services

The work will be performed in several phases to facilitate uninterrupted resident services and building site utilities.  Determining and designing the phasing of the work are aspects of this project. 

The project will incorporate cost-effective and innovative strategies to meet the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 goals to reduce energy consumption.

The completed Bridging Design Documents will be included in a separate Design-Build contract solicitation RFP.

SCOPE OF WORK

The proposed A/E Design Contract (Base Contract) will require, but is not limited to, preparation of bridging design documentation and related services as follows:  drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, renderings, mock-ups, computer graphics, color/material selections and presentations, system design and calculations, life cycle costing, value engineering, programming, space planning, and other similar services as determined to be required.  In addition, the A/E Design Contract will require the A/E Design Firm to provide computer aided design (CAD) documentation, including building information modeling (BIM), a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews, and concept approval submission(s) and presentation(s) to the PBS Commissioner.  The GSA will require the A/E Design Firm to make such presentations to other public authorities and commissions for project approvals as required.
The following optional services may also be required:  
&#61607;	Assistance with design reviews during design phase of Design-Build Contract. 
&#61607;	Assistance during construction to validate work as it relates to the Bridging Design.

SCOPE OF WORK:   The Contractor shall perform helicopter aerial wildlife counting services for large mammal evaluations.  The work area is from Columbia River mile 315 at mouth of Walla Walla River, to Snake River mile 60, mouth of Palouse River, WA, on both sides of the river and islands.

The following work shall be performed:  	<BR><BR>1.1 Hours and species:  Fly approximately 22 hours total between 29 January and 12 February, 2009.  Wildlife species to be included in the census are white-tailed deer, mule deer, coyote, skunk, raccoon, badger, cougar, fox, and any other mammal species observed.<BR><BR>1.2  Weather, Terrain, and Flight Limitations:  Work will be performed in areas of rugged terrain, steep slopes (up to 2,000 feet), and narrow valleys.  Weather in the work area includes strong up-and-down drafts and side winds.  Rain, snow, fog, and extreme cold are common in the winter months.  Obstructions include high tension powerlines, telephones lines, trees, and canyon walls.  A substantial portion of the work will be performed at approximately 100-200 feet above ground level (AGL).  Pilot must demonstrate experience in these types of terrain and weather with the minimum hours specified in paragraph 1.5.<BR><BR>1.3  Flight Patterns:   The flight shall begin at the mouth of the Walla Walla River and progress upriver, with the emphasis on completing both sides of the river prior to beginning other river sections.  In the event of unsuitable weather or scheduling conflicts, the flights may begin at any designated point.<BR><BR>1.4  Survey Dates:  Starting dates and locations will be coordinated with Mr. Mark Halupczok, Wildlife Biologist, Ice Harbor Dam, (509) 543-6069.  The Contractor shall be given 7 days verbal notice to begin work.<BR><BR>1.5  Pilot Experience:   Pilot shall have a minimum of 1,000 hours helicopter flying time as pilot-in-command, with a minimum of 300 hours shall be recent experience, flown in the past 24 month.  In addition, a minimum of 200 hours of the above-referenced experience shall be in areas of rugged terrain and weather as referenced in paragraph 1.2.  Pilot must be able to predict animal behavior patterns in response to low-flying aircraft which are already in a stressed condition due to weather.  A written record of pilot experience shall be presented to the Contracting Officer at the per-award survey.<BR><BR>1.6  Observer Experience:   Observers shall have a minimum of 30 hours of helicopter flying time as an observer during aerial deer counts.  All experience shall be recent, flown within the past 24 months.  A written record of observer experience shall be presented to the Contracting Office at the per-award survey.<BR><BR>1.7  Survey Methods:   The flight shall begin at the mouth of the Walla Walla River and progress upriver, with the emphasis on completing both sides of the river prior to beginning other river sections.  In the event of unsuitable weather or scheduling conflicts, the flights may begin at any designated point.<BR><BR>1.7.1  Flights shall be from the river landward up to 1.5 miles or to the top of the canyon, allowing for sufficient census of deer.  Flights shall be done in river mile sections at several elevations within each section.<BR><BR>1.7.2	The following species and data shall be recorded:<BR><BR>DEER<BR>a.	Approximate River Mile, GPS coordinates, and Shore (North or South).<BR>b.	Elevation of Animals (100 foot intervals)<BR>c.	Species<BR>d.	Number of Bucks (points on antlers if discernable)<BR>e.	Number of Does<BR>f.	Number of fawns<BR>g.	Herd Size<BR><BR>COYOTE, SKUNK, RACOON, BADGER, COUGAR, FOX, ELK, MOOSE, BEAR, AND INCIDENTAL SPECIES<BR>a.

Data shall be totaled by sheet and the Contractor shall submit all original data sheets to the COR.  The Contractor shall total all species by project (McNary, Ice Harbor, and Lower Monumental) and shore (North or South) and submit these totals on a separate sheet.  <BR><BR>1.8  Delays and Terminations:   Once a census or survey is directed to start, the only delays to cause rescheduling will be weather-related.  All scheduled equipment maintenance must be taken into account so no delays occur in the census or survey.  Termination of daily census will be made by the pilot in conjunction with the observers.  A substantial drop in deer sight ability, severe weather, or significant changes in topography will be used as the determining factor(s) for termination.<BR><BR>1.9  Reimbursement:  The Government shall be reimbursed by the successful Contractor on the differential in costs between the bid price and any subsequent contract of helicopter surveys in case said successful bidder is unable to furnish a functional aircraft, qualified pilot, or observers, and another contractor must be employed by the government to accomplish the work.  Bidders are cautioned not to obligate themselves to more hours and locations than they have equipment and personnel to handle.<BR><BR>1.10  Time is of the essence:  The success of these programs is mostly dependent upon weather and the observables of the animals.  In the event of noncompliance of specification or contract requirements, service, performance, or supply, as set forth in this contract, termination of the contract may be given by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR><BR>2.

The Contractor shall also provide documentation of observer experience.<BR><BR>2.4	References:  Contractor may be asked to provide three (3) references from the three most recent jobs they have completed which will allow the Government to verify their performance with respect to the above factors. Animal behavior pattern is defined as the direction, distance, reaction to obstacles, and probable route that an animal may travel in response to being followed by the helicopter. It also includes the ability to determine, with reasonable certainty, whether or not the animals currently are being followed were previously counted, based on the other behavior pattern factors.<BR><BR>2.5	Pre-work Meeting:  The Contractor shall be required to attend a pre-work meeting with the district and project biologist and the COR to discuss procedures, billings, contract provisions, and other pertinent topics of discussion.<BR><BR>2.6	Contracting Officers Representative:   A Wildlife Biologist from Ice Harbor Dam will be designated as the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for this contract.<BR><BR>2.7	Lodging, Meals, Other Expenses:  Contractor shall be responsible for all lodging, meals, transportation, and other expenses for themselves and any ground crew associated with this contract.<BR><BR>2.8	Reports:<BR><BR>2.8.1	Exposure Hours:  The Contractor shall submit a monthly report of the number of exposure hours by project (actual work hours plus ferry hours).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.    Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

BACKGROUND
The Executive Office for U.S. Attorney’s (EOUSA) is seeking a comprehensive enterprise-wide Emergency Notification System (ENS) to notify United States Attorneys’ offices and EOUSA employees of emergency and contingency situations.

Minimally, the system shall be able to transmit alert messages via conventional and mobile telephone, pagers, electronic mail, and Short Message Service (SMS) text.

The status of the broadcast can be seen real-time on screen or via report detailed by user and medium used. There will also be exception reports to ensure those not notified can be traced via other methods in the event normal notification is not possible. 

The ENS must be capable of notifying U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorney’s in locations throughout the United States and United States’ territories including the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

The Government intends system to have achieved initial operational capabilities within 14 days of contract award in accordance with SOW requirements.


The Government has no preference regarding newly developed systems versus existing systems. 


The SOW does not specify any particular system.  The Government will consider all vendor offerings.


EVALUATION CRITERIA

 (a) The Government will award a commercial item purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Organizational Experience
Organizational Past Performance
Key Personnel
Price

Organizational Experience, Organizational Past Performance, and Key Personnel, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Under Section 6, Basic Functionality, it says:

"A person using a phone/cell shall be able to trigger notifications that include existing groups and scenarios."

Does this mean a person can SEND alerts from the phone/cell or does it mean send notifications that an alert was received?  It would help immensely to clarify this particular requirement.

Response: The Government intends to send alerts from phone/cell.  

If the answer is, alerts must be able to be sent from a phone/cell, can you specify what types of phones/cells are required for this functionality?  For example, it may be possible from the newer smartphones (e.g., iPhones or Blackberry Storm), but not older phones.

Response: The Government intends to send alerts from any phone/cell.

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition:  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation meet the following: 

The following standards must be adhered to for optimum performance of copiers which support the Office of the Secretary:

1.  Flat rate monthly charge for unlimited black & white copies - the flat rate maintenance plan will accommodate the migration of stand alone printers to multi-functional devices; supporting a Departmental directive. The rate also includes all labor, parts, toner, and staples. 

2.   Provide Canon imageWare Enterprise Management Console at no additional cost. This internet portal allows OS to actively monitor the status of all Canon multifunction devices within the DHHS network in real-time. This includes viewing service histories as well as monitoring the status of staples, toner, paper, network connection, and meter readings.

3.  Provide webcasts for training to update the OS on systems and software changes and to be fully apprised of all other technical requirements at no additional charge.

4.  Fully support the present life guarantee replacement cycle warranty. Within three years of original installation of any newly installed Canon brand equipment or throughout the term of Canon leased equipment, the offerror will, at the Government’s request replace such equipment with a like unit if the following three conditions are met: (1) the equipment is continuously under a Canon authorized service provider maintenance agreement from the date of installation; (2) all terms of the Canon maintenance agreement applicable to the Government are fulfilled; and (3) prior to requesting a replacement “like for like” unit, the offerror is given a reasonable opportunity to cure any service problems with the equipment.

5.  Authorized Canon technical support which utilizes only Canon genuine parts for service and replacements. The maintenance by certified Canon technicians on Canon equipment insures the continuation of the warranty agreement on leased Canon equipment. NOTE: The warranty shall be void and of no force and effect if the copier is damaged as a result of repair by other than service representatives qualified by Canon U.S.A. and acting in accordance with Canon U.S.A.’s service bulletins.  This will also ensure that all integrated multifunctional, digital solutions incorporating eCopy (Canon partner) will continue to address the workflow requirements of the OS customers.

 
6.  Dedicated eCopy representative and eCopy trained systems engineers. The offerror will provide maintenance and support (purchased by the Government at installation), for the remaining term of the M&S agreements that are currently in effect at no additional cost. The offerror will provide the Government with customer references that have both Washington DC and National coverage with eCopy installed. The offerror will provide their systems engineer support infrastructure for eCopy to include systems engineers and certifications and years of experience for supporting eCopy installations.

7.  Network integration and training at no charge for initial installations and troubleshooting during the life cycle of the equipment. Dedicated hardware and software, Canon -pecific trained technical systems engineers are included.

8.  Meter readings are submitted through an interactive interface or through a simple Microsoft Excel-based bulk upload interface reducing the OS workload for color copiers.

9.  Dedicated Federal Account Executive exclusive to HHS to monitor any technical, administrative, and billable issues and provide an account analysis and review on a weekly basis and work with any related facilities management service. 

10.  No cost training for at least two sessions per machine.

11.  One (1) preventative maintenance check per year, per Canon specifications.

12.  Four (4) hour response time during business hours, 7:00am through 5:00pm, local prevailing time. 

13.  One (1) extra toner per machine, per location.

14.  No pre-maintenance inspections are allowed.

15.  Service which resolves network integration issues remotely at no additional charge if they appear related to the copier’s connectivity, specifically the print board or eCopy scanning functionality.

16.  If OS elects to add additional accessories, there is no increase in service pricing.

17.  Practices with document encryption, security and authentication with a senior staff of senior system engineers for pre-sales activity and consultation.

 
18.  Validate device types, id install locations, and access account information and account submission of service and supply requests through an internet based account management application at no additional charge.

19.  Utilization of a user management interface to access requests, delegate responsibilities, and assign privileges to multifunctional devices at no additional charge.

20.  Consistent technical staff/hardware and software - Canon specific trained.

21.  Administration of services contract for local and national response - critical for the regional and field offices’ ability to interface with Canon’s direct and wholesale operation.

22.  Use of a no charge customer support center: a program available to solve integration network issues quickly via a phone site operating twelve hours a day. Site provides training and webcasts to the field for updated technology and new software to understand significant and relative technical issues.

23.  Provide a service response plan and training response plan, and include number of staff for each.

<DESC>The subcontracting goals for this district were incorrectly stated in the original synopsis.  The correct FY09 Target Goals published by USACE Headquarters are as follows:

Small Business - 52.23%
Small Disadvantaged Business - 8.98%
HUBZone Small Business - 7.45%
Women-Owned Small Business - 5.03%
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business - 3.0%
  

The following questions have been received and responses are provided:

Q1.  Does the 140 page limit also include the Part II pages, or only Part I?  Does the 140 page limit include the detailed Quality Control Plan?
A1.  The entire SF330s qualifications package is limited to 140 (8.5"x11") pages, excluding sample CADD compatibility CD ROM, as specified in Paragraph 4, Submission Requirements.

Q2.  Some Districts allow a total of only 10 projects in the project section of the qualification package, but other Districts allow up to 10 for each firm on the team. Can we use more than 10 total projects as long as the total number of pages is under 140?
A2.  This synopsis does not place any limitations on the number of projects, as long as the total number of pages is within the 140 page limitation.  

Q3.  Are we to hold to the minimum 12 pitch font requirement for all text and text within the forms, or just the text in Section H?  
A3.  All SF330 text shall not be smaller than 12 font type.    

Q4.  Are these services currently being provided by a contractor?  If so, could you please provide the incumbent name as well as the contract number?
A4.  W911WN-07-D-0001 was awarded to INCA/FMSM JV, 400 112th Ave., NE #400, Bellevue, WA  98004 on April 26, 2007.  W911WN-07-D-0002 was awarded to Bergmann Associates, Suite 200, 28 East Main St., Rochester, NY  14614 on April 11, 2007.  Task orders were negotiated as necessary.

Q5.  Does the Pittsburgh District accept Joint Ventures (JV)?  If so, is it sufficient to have an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the JV with the qualification package submittal, rather than the completed JV? 
A5. If a company is submitting their technical proposal as a JV, they will need to provide something official that shows they have the intent to perform the contract as a JV should they be awarded the contract.  This can be in the form of a contingent MOU between the two companies.  The MOU must indicate that the JV agreement will be formalized if the JV is proposed for award of a contract and the firm/s will perform the contract as such.  The agreement must be approved by the boards of both companies.

NOTE:  Any questions related to this synopsis should be sent to Carole Householder at carole.householder@usace.army.mil, with a copy to Jim Costantino at james.m.costantino@usace.army.mil.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The date specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the vendor;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(5) Terms of any express warranty;<br />(6) Price and any discount terms;<br />(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;<br />(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);<br />(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;<br />(11) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) N/A<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) N/A<br />(2)<br />(i) Any quote, modification, revision, or withdrawal of a quote received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quote would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of quotes; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of quotes and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of quotes; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for quotation, it was the only quote received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful quote, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the quote, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotes cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of quotes by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes. Oral quotes in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile quotes, quotes may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile quotes. A quote may be withdrawn in person by a vendor or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of quotes, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the quote.<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Multiple awards. (To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) N/A<br />(ii) N/A<br />(iii) N/A<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) N/A<br />(End of Provision)<br />(6) 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.<br />(i) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />(ii) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(iii) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Spacelift Range Group (LRRG) Program Office will be holding an Industry Day on 23 December 2008 for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for the LRRG Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; widest industry participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712 (size standard 1000). The Industry Day will be hosted by the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Bldg 272, Room C2-238, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback on the Government's draft acquisition documents for the LRRG SE&amp;I effort as part of the Government's ongoing market research. A draft RFP will be made available on or about 18 December 2008.</p>
<p>To aid in the development of a clear and effective RFP for the SE&amp;I contract, the LRRG Program Office is soliciting industry inputs on the following topics: 1) feedback on the Draft RFP, including the Performance Work Statement, Instructions to Offerors (Section L), incentive fee plan, contract deliverables and any other aspects of the documentation released; 2) Organizational Conflict of Interest issues; 3) feedback on the proposed 20% Tier 1 Small Business Subcontracting Goal; and 4) responses to the remainder of "Questions to Industry". A subset of the current program-developed copies of acquisition documents will be made available on the FEDBIZOPPS website under the title of LRRG SE&amp;I. Contractors shall document and submit all critical comments/input in writing, including recommended discussion questions and responses to the attached "Questions to Industry" by 1200 PST on 19 December 2008. Non-critical or general RFP document comments will be accepted through Industry Day. Discussion questions will be addressed through a formal Government-response posting on FEDBIZOPPS. All input shall be submitted to SMC/LRSW/PK (LRRG), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lin S. Jensen, Contracting Officer or via email to lin.jensen@losangeles.af.mil. Discussion questions must be marked appropriately; justification must be provided for any portion marked as proprietary or for other restrictions on their use.</p>
<p>All interested parties are invited to attend Industry Day on 23 December 2008 starting at 0800.&nbsp; The General Session will be from 0800-1000 where the Government team will present an LRRG program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system requirements, and the SE&amp;I contractor's required interaction with the other program elements. In the afternoon, LRRG will meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties. Please contact the Contracting Officer to arrange your one-on-one appointment. Following Industry Day, the collective non-proprietary questions and responses will be consolidated and posted to the FEDBIZOPPS website.</p>
<p>Seating is limited and registration is required for attendance. Please contact the Contracting Office to register and for information on the facility being used for discussions. Potential prime contractors will be limited to four (4) representatives and one (1) representative per potential subcontractor. For one-on-one discussions, the individual prime contractors or prime contractor teams will be limited to ten (10) representatives. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>For access to Los Angeles Air Force Base and LRRG Industry Day, all Visit Requests should be faxed to (310) 653-1508 by 19 December 2008. Requests should specify "Attn:&nbsp;Major Jasem Fleming, LRRG SE&amp;I Industry Day" and contain the following: Name/SSAN/DOB/POB/Citizenship/Clearance Level/Clearance Investigation Date/Clearance Granting Agency/Member's Company-Organizati89on/Meeting Subject/Meeting Location/ Visit Dates/LRSW Sponsor and Cage Code (for industry). All meetings will be held at the unclassified level.</p>
<p>Questions to Industry</p>
<p>1. Provide feedback on Section L/M.</p>
<p>2. Provide recommendations for Government insight into subcontractor execution and performance.</p>
<p>3. The concept for the potential contract is for the contractor to ensure the Government's functional, technical, and program baseline by producing and giving advice on Government referenced Architecture documents. Please identify the top three (3) risks associated with this concept.</p>
<p>4. Given the Incentive Plan and the requirements for the SE&amp;I contract, what would you recommend as an appropriate fee percentage for this contract? Can you suggest additional, alternative and/or better objective incentive events for this contract? Do you have any recommendations for better methods to incentivize performance using objective criteria?</p>
<p>5. What percentage of the entire requirement will be subcontracted? What percentage of the contracted work can be performed by small business (please provide a description of the work and the associated NAICS code)? What methodology was used to make the above determinations?</p>
<p>6. For the basic period of performance (POP) there are significant deliverables early in the POP. Please assess any risk in achieving the milestones.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 7 to BAA-08-21
Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE)

The purpose of this amendment to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) is to provide the following solicitation questions and answers:

Question 79: Provide rationale regarding the Amendment 06 High Band Performance Changes (1,2,4,& 5).

Answer 79:  Amendment 6 provides Proposer’s greater flexibility in meeting the MAINGATE SWAP, cost and/or performance requirements. 

Question 80a:  Specifically, does the move of the "Above UHF (High Band) use of directional antennas" as well as the move of the Overall Informational Rate "High Band (Above UHF) of > 10 Mbps (T); >100 Mbps (O)" from the Radio section of Attachment A to the Gateway section of Appendix A remove the requirement for high band performance and/or move the cost of the high band equipment from the Radio to the Gateway?  

Answer 80a: No, the amendment does not remove the requirement for high band performance.  Proposers must show they can achieve high band performance using MAINGATE.  The change provides proposers the opportunity to provide the high data rate capability above UHF either through an internal function, or though an external capability (see item
6 in amendment 6).  This change also provides the opportunity for the cost of the high band equipment to be removed from the radio cost, should the proposer desire to do so.

Question 80b: If neither is correct, then what is the rationale for this significant change/reduction in capability? 

Answer 80b:  Not applicable

Question 81:	Can DARPA advise the significance and major implications, if any, of moving the high band requirement from Section 1 Radio to Section 4 Gateway? Are there any implied new requirements?

Answer 81:  Amendment 6 provides proposers greater flexibility in meeting the MAINGATE SWAP, cost and/or performance requirements.   There are no implied new requirements. 

End of amendment 7

<DESC>The Agency of Office of The Secretary, through Strategic Acquisition Services (SAS), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 9 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the NH Institute for Health Policy and Practice
Regional All-Payer Healthcare Information Council (RAPHIC)
University of New Hampshire
202 Hewitt Hall
4 Library Way
Durham, NH 03824
The anticipated date of award is 12/31/2008.

The purpose of this sole source performance based contract is to support the mission of the Office of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality

All Payer Claims Databases (APCDs) are being established in multiple states, bringing together health care claims from all settings of care (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, dental) for all payers, or insurers, in a state.  APCDs have the potential to provide a unique source of information on costs and quality of care across the continuum of health services.  With the spread of APCDs across more states, it has become apparent that standardization of the data systems, formats, data elements, and coding is imperative.  Standardization will help to reduce costs of data submission for payers who must submit data to multiple data systems, facilitate cross-state sharing of data, enable multi-state research and analyses, and encourage the development of tools and measures for use with APCDs.

The work shall be performed primarily within the contractor’s workspace beginning January 09, 2009 through September 30, 2009.
The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Far 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available.

<DESC>The following questions were asked of project.  The answers are hereby incorporated into request for quotation 09WRQQ0031 and should be considered part of the specifications.
1.  Does the solicitation Item 0001 refer to the winch with both drums (one installed and one spare) or is the spare drum indentified as a separate item on the solicitation?
Answer:  The solicitation Item 0001 refers to the winch with both drums (one installed and one spare).
2.  The solicitation does not request a support or storage stand for the spare drum.  Shall we quote one as an option or would the purchase specification be revise to reflect this request?
Answer:  Quote the storage stand as an option.
3.  Are items 0002 - 0004  intended to be separately supplied items, i.e., spare part?  Or are they intended as a manufacturing option to replace the standard construction material of those components with stainless steel material?
Answer:  Items 0002 - 0004 are intended as manufacturing options to replace standard aluminum construction material.
4.  The technical description indicates a maximum depth dimension of 28 inches for the winch, however, the winch drum flange itself is indicated as a 30"diameter requirement.  Can you please clarify, as these two dimensions seem to conflict?
Answer:  The maximum depth dimension of 28 inches should be clarified as the maximum desired depth dimension of the base in contact with the deck.  The projected depth of the drum will be 30" as noted.  The maximum width of the base in contact with the deck must be no more than 26 inches to allow access to deck hatches (See attachement A of RFQ)
5.  We note the winch is intended for side scan sonar and towed camera operations, yet there is not requirement for the ability to accomodate a slip ring.  Does the user require a slip ring on the winch and, if so, would the purchase specification be revised to reflect this?  The provision of a slip ring would require several typical yet specific design features including drum cable entry, hollow shaft, slip-ring mounting flange, anti-rotation bracket, protective guard, etc.  Also, if a slip ring is required, we will need some detail on the type and model in order to assure compatibility.
Answer:  The design should include provisions for slip ring installation, including drum cable entry, hollow drum core, slip ring mounting flange, anti-rotation bracket and protective guard.  Slip rings used are IEC Corp. "BX" series, and have a 4" diameter.  End of shaft mounting flange with four 1/4" screw holes on 2.5" centers.  Slip rings are supplied by USGS.  Model numbers are IEL-BX and IEL-BXU-02 MOD.
6.  How long is each cable?
Answer:  Cable 1:  662 ft., 0.780 " multi-conductor plastic jacketed Kevlar cable with 4" of freeboard at full drum.  Cable 2:  1162 ft., 0.455" armored side scan cable with 4" of freeboard at full drum.
7.  How would you like the winch controlled - local controls, remote control, control on an umbilical?
Answer:  The winch will be controlled remotely.
8.  Specific line speed?
Answer:  Desired line pull:  1500 lbs max. (bare drum).  Desired line speed (up haul):  60m/min.

<DESC>Please note that this is NOT a request for SF330's or proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue a Request for Proposal. The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care Center, Biloxi, MS, is conducting a market survey for qualified small businesses that are Veteran-owned (VOSB) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) located within a 250 mile radius of the VAGCVHCS located at 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, MS.  If there are enough responses of interest to this notice the Request for Proposal will be issued as a 100% set-aside for SDVOSB or VOSB.  Look for any further information in FedBizOpps.  Applicable NAICS code is 541310 size standard $4.5 million. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax is acceptable) and received no later than December 12th, 2008. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES will be accepted. All responses to this notice must indentify the social economic category of the respondent, name and address of company, name and phone number of contact person, and must also include the company's DUNS number.  Applicants must have an established working office within a 250 mile radius of Biloxi, Mississippi.Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square foor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.  A/E shall submit one (1) set of Mylar sepia "as-builts" (each drawing shall be stamped "AS-BUILT" in red ink), and shall submit computer generated material depicting as-built conditions in accordance with all applicable VA Engineering CADD requirements.  A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCad 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.
