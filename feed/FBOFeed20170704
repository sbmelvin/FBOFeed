<DESC>Notice of Intent to Issue a Sole Source purchase order for High Quality Genomic Nucleic Acid
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Tetracore, Inc., located at 9901 Belward Campus Drive, Suite 300, Rockville, Maryland. The anticipated purchase order is for high quality genomic nucleic acid. The genomic nucleic acid will be used to generate full length genomic sequence, assembly and metadata that will be deposited onto the FDA Database for Reference Grade Microbial Sequences (ARGOS) data base and made publically available via National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and FDA web portal. The rapid development and dissemination of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies for in vitro diagnostic medical devices have made the HTS technologies a prime candidate for a medical device of public health importance. To realize the potential of HTS as diagnostic devices and to correctly assess its potential to promoting public health, sequence data quality measures, and solid scientific evidence are needed to foster the acceptance and widespread use of sequence-based diagnostic device technology. The availability of high quality sequence and metadata will improve access to cutting-edge, safe, and effective medical devices of public health importance. <br /><br />Award will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements using Simplified Acquisition Procedures per FAR Part 13.5. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement within seven (7) days after the publication of this synopsis, which will be considered by the agency. Responses received after seven (7) days or without the required information may not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete as a result, of information received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information concerning this acquisition, contact Linda Troutman, Contract Specialist at Linda.Troutman@fda.hhs.gov</p>

<p><strong>1.	Solicitation Number:	 HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SBSS-17-504</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.	Title:  Automated Liquid Handler </strong></p>

<p><strong>4.	NAICS Code:  334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />Gene Expression and Genomic Unit is the only genomics core at NIA Baltimore campus catering the unique sequencing needs of the NIA IRP investigators and thereby helping to fulfil NIA's goal to promote aging-related research. Upcoming projects contain 400-500 RNA samples for gene expression (apart from other samples) which would be impossible to sequence with our current manual sample preparation. The new Biomek i-5 Span-8 automatic liquid handler will can do many genomic sample-prep protocols for Next Generation Sequencing and other molecular biology protocols. This machine will be supported for approximately next 12-15 years which makes Biomek i-5 protected against newer next generation sequencing, genomic and molecular biology protocols.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The Gene Expression and Genomics Unit (GEGU), a core facility at NIA/NIH, is purchasing a new Beckman Coulter Biomek i5 Span-8 automated liquid handler for expediting Next-Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS) at NIA-IRP. The number of next-generation sequencing projects are increasing at an astounding rate to answer many scientific questions regarding aging and age-related diseases. To cope up with this increasing sample preparation load and to fully utilize the sequencing instruments already present in GEGU, we need to acquire this Beckman Coulter Biomek i5 Span-8 automated liquid handler.</p>

<p>1. Technical Capability:</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer may only award BPAs to responsible organizations whose proposals conform to this combined synopsis/solicitation and offer the best overall value to the Government. Any Offeror's proposal merely offers to perform work according to the terms of the RFP or fails to present more than a statement indicating its capability to comply with the terms without support and elaboration as specified in the instructions will be rendered non-responsive.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the Government may render any proposal unacceptable that merely offers to perform work according to the terms of the RFP or fails to present more than a statement indicating its capability to comply with the terms without support and elaboration as specified in the instructions.</p>
