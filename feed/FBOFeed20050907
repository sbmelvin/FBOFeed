            WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. 

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.


III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Business, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement and the PIP contain all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [Note: see other submission requirements under paragraph 6 for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This BAA requires completion of an online Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  To do so, the offeror must go to  http://CSC-Ballston.dmeid.org/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-51  and follow the instructions there.  Each offeror is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If an offeror intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  

PROPOSAL FORMAT
Offerors must submit an original and 2 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-51, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) 26 October 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 05-51, Application Communities will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) 05 September 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through 05 September 2006. While the proposals submitted after the 26 October 2005 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, offerors should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Offerors must obtain the BAA 05-51 Offeror Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-51 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
(2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem
(3)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology, Integration and Transition  
(4)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience
(5)	Proposed length of project 
(6)	Cost Realism

2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria which are detailed further in the PIP.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as Government Only.   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).


VI. Award Information Administration

1.  Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail.  

2.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Offerors may visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

For Research Involving Human Subjects: 
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards, and Federal Wide Assurances.  These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving greater than minimal risk to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA.  For proposals that are forecasted to involve greater than minimal risk after the first year, a discussion on how and when the offeror will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).
DARPA has determined that work for this program is to be funded by budget category 6.2 (Applied Research). This means that research performed under this program on-campus at a university is considered contracted fundamental research; therefore, public releases of information about such research are not subject to prior Government review. The definition of CONTRACTED FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH is contained in DOD Instruction 5230.27 and can be found at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf2/i523027p.pdf. Public release of information about research performed under circumstances other than those described above is subject to prior government review, according to the procedures available at http://www.darpa.mil/tio

3.  Reporting
The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Offeror Information Pamphlet (PIP).

The DARPA/CMO website referenced above also provides general information about reports required specifically for grants and cooperative agreements.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in Argonne, Illinois, Dupage County.  ANL is a multi-disciplinary research laboratory located on 1500 acres approximately 25 miles southwest of Chicago.  The site is owned by DOE and currently operated by the University of Chicago for DOEâ€™s Office of Science. ANLâ€™s mission is to serve DOE and national security by advancing the frontiers of knowledge, by creating and operating forefront scientific user facilities and by providing innovative and effective approaches and solutions to energy, environmental, and security challenges to the national and global well-being. ANLâ€™s scientific and technical experts support a broadly diversified research effort in support of DOE major R&D focus areas.  This includes programs in Basic Energy Sciences, Nuclear Energy Science and Technology, Nanotechnology, High Energy Physics, Computational Science, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Electric Transmission and Distribution, and work for National Nuclear Security Administration.  Collaboration among the various ANL Divisions, as well as other national and international institutions, is also a major strength and focus of its mission. ANL has several research facilities that are open to outside researchers from industry, academia and other national laboratories on a cost-recovery basis. The ANL research facility includes the following major Laboratory and user facilities: Advanced Photon Source (APS): The APS is a national user facility. The mission of the APS is to produce reliable, tunable x-ray beams for user research. Users at the APS conduct forefront basic and applied research in the fields of material science, biological science, physics, chemistry, environmental, geophysical, and planetary science, as well as x-ray instrumentation.  The APS can accommodate as many as 70 beamlines and serves a user community that exceeds 2500 individual industry, government, and university users. Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS): The IPNS is a national user facility for neutron scattering experiments.  The IPNS provides a dozen neutron scattering instruments, as well as facilities for studying radiation effects. Approximately 250 individual users perform a variety of neutron scattering experiments each year. Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS): The ATLAS facility is a superconducting accelerator for projectiles heavier than the electron. This facility is a DOE National Collaborative Research Facility open to scientists from all over the world.  ATLAS consists of a sequence of machines that produce high precision heavy-ion beams ranging over all possible elements, from hydrogen to uranium, to energies as high as 17 MeV per nucleon and delivered to one of three target areas. Center for Nano-scale Materials (CNM): The purpose of the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) is to create, characterize, and understand the behavior of new functional materials on the nanoscale.  The CNM exploits the unique electronic, magnetic, structural, chemical, and optical properties of individual nanostructures and their ordered arrays and includes examining the behavior and fundamental properties of functional nanocomposites of patterned ferroelectric and magnetic films, bio-inorganic hybrids, nanophotonic phenomena, and assisted self-assembly.  An APS hard x-ray nanoprobe beamline is part of the CNM. Electron Microscopy Center (EMC): The EMC is used to conduct materials research using advanced microstructural characterization methods and an Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope.  Research includes microscopy based studies in high thermal conductivity superconducting materials, irradiation effects in metals and semiconductors, phase transformations, and processing related structure and chemistry of interfaces in thin films. Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility: The ARM Program was created to resolve scientific uncertainties about global climate change with a specific focus on improving the performance of general circulation models used for climate research and prediction.  The ARM Program establishes and operates three field research sites, called Cloud and Radiation Testbeds (CARTS), in several climatically significant locations. Scientists collect and analyze data obtained over extended periods of time from large arrays of instruments to study the effects and interactions of sunlight, radiant energy, and clouds on temperatures, weather, and climate. Transportation Technology Research and Development (R&D) Center: The Transportation Technology R&D Center brings together scientists and engineers from many disciplines to find cost-effective solutions to the problems of transporting people and goods from one place to another. Argonne's transportation research focuses on three areas: advancing toward an environmentally benign passenger car, from fuel production through recycling of obsolete vehicles; paving the way to safer, cleaner trucks, buses, and locomotives; and improving traffic flow, safety, and security. In addition, ANL performs other non-DOE sponsored research that supports the Laboratoryâ€™s missions.  Through its technology transfer programs, industrial firms and other organizations benefit from ANLâ€™s technological knowledge, which increases the competitiveness of U.S. industry. Anticipated funding (from all sources) for fiscal year 2007 for ANL is approximately $492 million.  DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and will include a 60-day transition period.  All interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest to Jodi VonRox, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-06CH11357, at the following e-mail address: jodi.vonrox@ch.doe.gov.

Expressions of Interest should be received no later than 3:00pm Central Standard Time on October 14, 2005. Future information regarding this solicitation will be posted on DOEâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov.  DOE anticipates issuing a draft RFP in the first quarter of FY06.  The draft RFP will be open for comments or questions for approximately 40 days.  DOE expects to conduct a comment workshop, offer site tours and one-on-one meetings with prospective offerors about three weeks after the draft RFP is issued.  Following the issuance of the final RFP, DOE plans on hosting a pre-proposal conference.  Dates and times for the comment workshop, site tours, one-on-one meetings and the pre-proposal conference will be announced at a later date.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), announces its intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Accent Technologies, Inc., a small women-owned business, for the purchase of a 25-user license for Accent Librarian software including on-site installation and support, including travel expenses, and annual technical support and maintenance.  The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Background:  DOE-ID had established a common area to store PowerPoint presentations to facilitate the reuse of content, photos, graphics, flow charts, hyperlinks, documents, etc.  However, the manual approach currently used provides limited search capabilities and content management.  This hampers the reuse of presentation material.  Advanced electronic features were sought that would allow users to locate and easily reuse information from various presentations to prepare future high quality presentations. DOE-ID conducted market research and found three companies that provided the type of software that could potentially meet the Government's requirements. A request for software samples was extended and a review against the requirements below was conducted for SlideManager, Presentation Builder, and Accent Librarian.  Accent Librarian was the only software that fully met DOE-ID requirements.  Therefore, as required by FAR Part 13.106(b)(2), the contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available, as an exclusive licensing agreement with Accent Technologies is necessary to obtain this software. The requirements needed by DOE-ID and used to determine sources available that would meet the Government's requirements are: 1. The ability to create presentations from existing presentations quickly. 2. Cataloging Meta data information. 3. Web-based. 4. Hyperlink functionality. 5. Multi-user access. 6. Assign access rights based on users need or role. 7. Key word searches (full-text search) and retrieval at content level on pages or slides. 8. DOE-ID hosts the software. 9. Ability to find Presentation in one location. 10. Taxonomy strategy for content management. 11. Document management system. 12. Browse and search inside files to quickly assemble new documents. 13. Be able to use shared files. 14. Create personalized sets of presentations. 15. Be able to categorize presentations for easy retrieval. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive offers and a solicitation will not be issued.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements listed above may give written notification to the Contract Specialist via email by no later than 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time on September 22, 2005.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The written notification should be sent to Janet Surrusco at Janet.Surrusco@nuclear.energy.gov.

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for an intensified photodiode detector with InGaAsp, 1mm diameter cathode for 1.06 um wavelength operation, GaAs APD anode, QE minimum of 20% and gainof 10,000 minimum with a model 284 power supply. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Intevec Inc. in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The detector must simultaneously operate in both analog and digital mode such that post-detector circuitry can simultaneously detect photon counts and analof optical waveforms.  After conducting and in-house survey of 1.06 micron-wavelength sensitive optical-detector vendors, we find that the above company is the only source of 1.06 micron-wavelength-sensitive optical-detector that meets our requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on the closing date listed above.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Digital Video System.  This system consists of a digital video compressor and recorder system capable of simultaneously recording 2 or more NTSC standard color video signals, a Digital I/O board used to configure the system, and a video compression/signal transmission board which is compatible with the current External Tank (ET) camera system.  A power Module and enclosure Software and a demodulator are to be provided to view the analog NTSC and allow control of video compression and transmission chracteristics. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Ecliptic Enterprises Corporation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  Because of the software interfaces, the digital video system must be compatible with the current ET camera system.  Ecliptic is the current provider for the ET camera system and knows the requirements and capabilities of the current system.  Also, Ecliptic is the only known vendor providing an intergrated system with the capabilities and known compatibility with current ET camera system.  While individual components of the system could be acquired from other sources, it would not be cost effective to do so because of the resources that would be needed to write a software code to intergrate the video system to the camera system.  In addition, the ability to write the code would be severly limited due to the proprietary nature of the detailed specifications for the current shuttle imaging system and interfaces, which were developed by Ecliptic. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Septenber 19, 2005.

The sample cans shall be used in neutron scattering powder diffraction experiments.  These cans are used because they produce a low level, innocuous background signal compared to other material.  The design of the sample cans make explicit use of the deep drawn character of the tubes because the smooth closed end enables making the maximum use of the available sample without increasing unwanted background scattering.  The combination of the ability to produce the deep drawn vanadium tubes plus the experience and capability to electro-weld to titanium and leak-check the results is critical for the reliability required in these sample cans.  Metal Technology Inc. is the only known source that can provide these customized deep-drawn vanadium assembly sample cans that maximize use of available sample, have minimum number of joints and have high reliability.  The NAICS code is 332999 with a size standard of 500 employees.****The period of performance shall be ten (10) weeks from receipt of order, FOB Destination.***The Government anticipates the award of  a fixed price purchase order.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from interested offerors.  A full copy of this amendment, including the Standard Form (SF) 30 cover sheet can be found at the IRS Procurement website: http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/.  A signed copy of the SF30 acknowledging the amendment is required to be submitted along with all proposals.  The due date for proposals is NOT extended as a result of this amendment and all terms and conditions remain unchanged.  Question # 1.  How many of the 7,618 applicants taking the exam in 2004 took the completed exam (4 parts) and how many only took individual parts?  Is there a complete breakdown of who completed what?

Answer #1:  We can provide estimates for the number signed up to take part of the exam.  In 2004, approximately 1,250 signed up to take part of the exam and the remainder took the entire exam.  
  
Question # 2. How many challenges and questions should be expected?
Answer #2:
In 2004 we received 1,456 challenges.  Our current policy is to release all the questions to the public for feedback as well as "unofficial answers".   After consideration of feedback (i.e. challenges) we arrive at our "official answers" approximately 5 - 6 weeks after the examination.  The decision on whether to use this approach or an alternative approach, such as not releasing the questions to the public, should be part of the offeror's solution to the requirement.  If the questions are not released to the public we would expect the number of challenges to be reduced significantly.
  
Question # 3. How often has IRS been forced to defend the SEE (Special Enrollment Exam) legally? 
Answer #3:
To the best of our knowledge, never.
 
Question # 4. Does IRS have previous job analysis information that we can use?
Answer #4:
No.
 
Question # 5. Does IRS have previous test blueprint information that we can use?
Answer #5:
No.
 
Question # 6. Will IRS provide SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) for item bank development?
Answer #6:
No.  However, to the extent noted in the solicitation, the IRS will provide subject matter experts for the job analysis and pilot testing.
 
Question # 7. How has IRS created cut-scores for the SEE in the past?
Answer #7:
The passing rate has been set at 60%. 

 
Question # 8. How many requests are made for lists of SEE applicants annually?
Answer #8:
Records are only available for this year to date.  From the first of this year, to date there have been 26 paid requests for lists of Enrolled Agents.
 
Question # 9. What metrics does IRS use currently to measure SEE program effectiveness?
Answer #9:
Comments we receive from candidates and professional organizations help us measure the effectiveness. 
 
Question # 10.  Is there a prior job analysis and may we have a copy if awarded (the contract)?  
Answer #10:
There is none. 

Question # 11.  The 2004 Special Enrollment Exam Topic List included 30 topics for part 1, 29 topics for Part 2,  15 topics for part 3, and 12 topics for Part 4 (see Appendix). How were those distribution of topics established?
Answer #11:
We typically have had a revenue agent lead a team of IRS employees in developing questions.  This team lead decided on the distribution of topics.
 
Question # 12. Exam validation, including pilot tests of the exam.  Provide the IRS with validation report with results of the pilot test.  Provide the IRS with a recommendation for the cut-score for final approval.  Is the stipulation of a cut score meant to preclude an Adaptive Testing approach?
Answer #12:
Not necessarily, however detailed explanation would be needed in order to justify the use of Adaptive Testing.  Given the breadth of knowledge needed to be an Enrolled Agent, we want to focus on the EAs demonstrating the necessary knowledge rather than on a specific percentage of people passing the exam.

Question # 13.  Update exam as needed to reflect changes in tax law, exam saturation and scoring.  How will "as needed" be determined, and what will be the timeline for the update? 
Answer #13:
 We currently administer the examination in September based on the law applicable for the prior year's returns.  For instance, an examination administered in 2005 will reflect the law in affect for preparing 2004 tax returns.
 
Question # 14.    "8.0          Considerations -        
b.         ....Up to two (2) IRS employees will be available for pilot testing up to 16 hours each."  How was the number 2 determined? 
Answer #14:
Two (2) IRS employees will be available for up to 16 hours each for pilot testing because that is the IRS manpower commitment available for this project.

 Question # 15.   There is no restriction on the format(s) of the exam or frequency. The IRS is seeking the best overall approach to the SOO that is economically feasible.  Does format unrestricted refer to the T/F, multiple choice or computation components, or the topics tested?  
Answer #15:
Format unrestricted refers to the t/f, multiple choice or computational components.  It is up to the vendor to determine topics tested through their job analysis. 

Question # 16.  With regard to Exam development and validation:  Are parallel forms required, or will randomized question order suffice? 
Answer #16:
The approach used for this should be part of the offeror's solution offered in their proposal.

Question # 17. How many appeal cases occur per year? When a successful appeal of the scoring key has been made, are all other test-takers rescored and re-contacted? 
Answer #17: 
There is no appeals process in place.
We give ourselves about 5 weeks to consider challenges and come up with final answers.  Only after the final answers are determined do we grade the exams.  If we accept a challenge, it will impact all test takers, not just the individual who wrote in.  

Question # 18. How will the contractor be paid for applicants who have taken previous parts under the old fee structure?
Answer #18:  Accommodation of applicants who have passed part of the exam under the prior format is not a requirement of the solicitation.
 
Question # 19. May we have access to de-identified applicant item-level performance data for prior examinations?    
Answer #19:
We can provide frequency distribution reports to the successful offeror, providing a breakdown of how each question was answered.   We can also provide a passing basis summary report showing how many individuals received what scores.  

Question #20. Paragraph (h) (vi) on page 39 of 48 states that “a sample exam comparable to that which will be developed in satisfaction of this requirement” is to be submitted with the proposal, in CD format.  Two questions with regard to this requirement:
a.	Please define in some meaningful way what is meant by “comparable.” One assumes that it does not mean “comparable” in length to the current examination.

Answer # 20 a.  "Comparable" means an exam of similar depth and complexity that has been developed for another application.  The purpose of this requirement is to demonstrate the quality of exam produced by each offeror.

b.	Can the Government provide assurances that the sample exam will be kept secure and that it will be destroyed after award?

Answer # 20 b.  All proposal material is kept secure.  One copy of all proposals is retained in the contract file, and all other material is securely destroyed at the conclusion of the acquisition process.

Question # 21.  Paragraph (4) Price states that “overall price will include the fees collected for reimbursement of Government expenses plus fees that will be retained by the contractor. Can the Government provide an amount that all bidders can use as the “fees collected for reimbursement of Government expenses”?

Answer # 21.  The fee collected for the reimbursement of Government expenses will be determined and provided to the successful offeror for inclusion in their fee collection process.  This amount will be the same for all offerors and, therefore, has no impact on the competitive process.  The amount has not be definitively determined at this time.

Question #22.  Attachment A, Phase 2—Exam Development identifies one of the major activities as “External review of the exam by outside professionals.” Who are these outside professionals? Are they tax experts? Are they testing experts? What organization(s) are involved in the review?

Answer #22.  Attachment A is an overview of the current program for exam development and administration.  It is provided for your background information only and is not intended as a requirement to influence offeror's proposals.  Therefore, the answers to this question are not necessarily germane for an offeror's proposal development.    

Question #23.  Will continue the policy of publicly releasing the test items on an annual basis?

Answer # 23.  While release of the test items was a practice under IRS administration of the exams, it is not an IRS policy and is not a requirement for this solicitation/contract.

Question #24.  Where are the resumes of key personnel to be included?

Answer # 24.  While resumes have not been specifically requested, key personnel information should be included in the technical portion of the proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>FA9302-05-P-E155
<RESPDATE>090705

<CONTACT>Mary Uptergrove, Contract Negotiator, Phone 661-275-2538, Fax 661-275-7819, Email mary.uptergrove@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The AFFTC, 412 Test Wing (412TW/EWBC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers in accordance with the following Statement of Work:
STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS. 1.0 SCOPE: The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of foam absorbers in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 1,680 EACH 72” foam absorbers and 36 EACH 24” foam absorbers is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies. 2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS IEEE STANDARD 1128 –“Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz”. NRL Report 8093 – “Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers”. 
3.0 REQUIREMENTS:  3.1 Testing. Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on tale below.) The break points are listed in the table below: Frequency (MHz) Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB) 80 -20, 120 – 30, 200 – 40, 300 – 40, 500 – 45. 3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance. The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov – 2 Dec 2005. The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery. 3.3 Fire Retardant.
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  3.4 Physical Characteristics for RAM:  “A low frequency test area design requires larger Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) in order to eliminate multi-path reflections from the floor to the test zone.   a. Implementation of the 72” RAM on the BAF chamber floor requires it to be tilted at various angles in order to obtain an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 100MHz.  In order to accurately tilt the 72” RAM and provide the greatest layout flexibility, three separate RAM wedge angles are needed, 45°, 30°, and 15°.  Each wedge type should be color coded to provide easy identification.  Velcro with suitable strength will be attached to each wedge and single piece of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The wedges will be loaded with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  In addition, special RAM pieces needed for the specular region of the RAM layout will be required.  These pieces are made by using a special 2’x2’x2’ cube with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  They will fit in the area where the 72” pyramidal RAM is titled at 45° and pointing in opposite directions.  The cubes will be made with Velcro on two adjoining surfaces so that two 24” pyramidal RAM pieces can be attached to them.  The total number of cubes needed for the specular region is 36 each.  The total number of 24” pyramidal RAM is 36 each. 	b.  Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80 MHz to 500 MHz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values table cited above: High frequency reflectivity measurements are required on 10% of the full lot of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The frequency band for this measurement is from 6 to 18 GHz at near normal incident angle.  Test samples will be taken from sub-lots throughout the manufacture run and are deliverable (A001). c. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance.  d. Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  
e. Note: The physical characteristics of the 72” RAM: * Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/ft3, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.
3.5 Past Performance Requirements. Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: 
a.	RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2, 3.3 & 3.4)
b.	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
c.	Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.6 Program Management. The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements for providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide listed above.  

Firms responding to this synopsis must identify their company’s capabilities to perform the requirements described herein, reference the synopsis number and indicate whether or not that they are a small business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS code is 326150.  The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  

The information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought synopsis.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded in September 2005. 

All responses may be sent via e-mail to mary.uptergrove@edwards.af.mil  or mail to 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Mary Uptergrove, 412TW/PKDD.  Fax Number: 661-275-7819.

<DESC>Subject: RFP HM1576-05-R-0003 (Human Development Technology and Services (HDT&S)
 
Dear Potential Offerors
 
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Human Development (HD) Directorate mission is to attract, develop and retain a world-class Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) workforce.  NGA’s strategy is to align and integrate the various HD services to successfully accomplish the mission.  Currently, HD service functions are provided through several individual contract support vehicles which provide a full range of human development support.  The HD strategy will unify these efforts in a new HD Support Program along functional lines. At this time, the planned functional elements will include: Human Capital Management (HMC); Learning Management Services (LMS); Program Management; Corporate Health and Wellness; Drug Testing Services; and Organizational Development. NGA’s strategy is to procure these efforts through full and open competition for HCM and LMS, and through small business set-aside competition for Program Management, Corporate Health and Wellness, Drug Testing Services, and Organizational Development.

This letter provides a notification of NGA’s intent to release draft RFP documents in support of the full and open competition for HCM and LMS.  Draft documents for the small business set-aside functional areas will be released at a later date. Draft documents include the draft Performance Work Statement, dated 6 September 2005, entitled “National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Human Development Technology and Services (HDT&S)”, and Draft RFP Sections B, C, L, and M. These documents are available for your review/comment at https://www.fedteds.gov. This is an early draft and we are looking for feedback to improve the final RFP.  Your comments to NGA as the result of this draft are greatly appreciated.

Both HCM and LMS will be competed under a single solicitation document. Offeror’s are encouraged to propose on one or both efforts.  The Government reserves the right to award a single contract for both efforts, or award separate contracts for each effort.  The Government contemplates awarding a hybrid-type of contract to include Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Award Fee and Cost Reimbursable type contract provisions.  The estimated performance period is from date of award for twelve months, with four (4) option years (5 years total).   

A pre-solicitation conference will be conducted for interested offerors on 13 September 2005 from 8:00 a.m. until 15:00 p.m. at the Mission Partner Facility (MPF), 14520 Avion Parkway, Suite 120, Chantilly, VA  20151.  Further instructions regarding the pre-solicitation conference are posted at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  Participants may submit questions to HDT&S@nga.mil.   To the maximum extent practicable, we expect to have answers at the conference for those questions submitted by 09 September 2005.  We encourage participants to submit the questions as they are generated.  There will be an opportunity to submit written questions at the conference and afterwards as NGA will accept written comments through 19 September 2005.  All briefings presented during pre-solicitation conference and all questions and answers will be posted to the website https://www.fedteds.gov/ on or about 21 September 2005.  Offerors are reminded that the FedTeDs website will be the primary tool to communicate with industry.  NGA will post a notice of release of the final RFP through www.fedbizopps.gov, however, changes or additions to documents will be posted directly to FedTeDs may not be announced through the www.fedbizopps.gov.  Please be advised that it is the sole responsibility of prospective offerors to check the FedTeDs site regularly in order to remain current with posted information.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  


THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the Medical Marketing Services, Inc. (MMS), 185 Hansen Court, Suite 110, Wood Dale, IL 60191, to acquire the American Medical Association’s Physician Master File.  

	The focus of this project is to provide the year-end 04 historical file; match up to the 	Race and UPIN Files; match to the saved end-of-year Dec.04 file to extract alternate 	(office) addresses; match office address and provide alternate office address in both 	places; convert AMA state code to FIPS code, combine with county FIPS, match to list 	with county name; and append residency name and state of residents.

The anticipated period of performance for this project is for one (1) year.  The statutory authority is FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  MMS is the sole supplier authorized by the American Medical Association to market the Physician Master File.  Any other organization would have to duplicate the database. A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  Any interested party may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication within 15 days from the date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The NAICS Code is 541990.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 3, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

Question 1

Please identify the specific categories of pest certification required.  The list of pests to be suppressed greatly exceeds the work legally covered by the category of certification described.    For example, outdoor treatment of insects that feed on vegetation is category 3; and mosquito larva treatment is category 5; not within the Industrial, Institutional, Structural, and Health Related Pest Control categories. 

A) The contractor shall have all required certificates to meet our requirements.

Question 2

Fumigation falls within the Industrial, Institutional, Structural, and Health Related Category.  Few companies hold that certification, as it is deadly work with little use in an urban setting. Also Industrial Weed falls in the same group, Does the Offeror have to maintain those specific certifications?  

A) If the need for fumigation arises, the contractor shall need to be certified.  This is a IPM contract fumigation is the last resort.

Question 3

A) Must the Offeror have the pesticide certifications in hand at the time of bid or acquire them after the award and prior to work being performed?

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and following the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR part 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested.

Solicitation number APVSNVXX-0203-5 is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-4.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  The requirement is solicited on an open market basis for potential set-aside to a small business.  If two or more small businesses firms submit responsive proposals the requirement will be set-aside to small businesses and award be made to that small business offering the lowest price.  Should fewer than two small businesses submit responsive proposals, the requirement will be deemed unrestricted and award will be made based on the evaluation factors noted below.

You are invited to submit a brand name or equal proposal for the supplies and services as listed in the attachment entitled “LIST OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES”.

INTRODUCTION:  USDA’s Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) needs an Animal Resources Management (Medical Research) application with an integrated veterinary management system. The process covered starts with the submission of a research protocol.  The protocol is distributed to the Animal Care and Use Committee members for review and comment.  Following approval of the research protocol by the Animal Care and Use Committee, researchers can request the purchase of animals.  Animal care staff will  record the animal inventory with a bar code system.  Researchers and veterinarians will be able to record information on the individual animals and access it either from the current network or from a remote location via a peripheral device to be supplied with this application.

The proposed software application will have the ability to track the complete history of an individual animal, from approval of the research protocol, to arrival, to treatment of the animal, with the ability to access that record in the barn.  Currently, a paper record is started for each instance of illness.  Later, veterinarians and researchers must physically go to the previous paper records on that animal to look at prior diagnoses and treatments.  An integrated veterinary management system will help to centralize the individual records for the animals in our various facilities.  The application will help to capture the diagnosis and treatment information at the location of the animals in real time, and will also allow several different veterinarians to access the complete record for an individual animal, as well as groups of animals.

The proposed software application must be 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, and GLP, GALP and GCP compliant.  The proposed application would use an Oracle or SQL database, and allow for customization.  Licenses, maintenance & support, training, peripherals, implementation support and project management are also required, as listed in the “LIST OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES”.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is interested in receiving information on commercially available manual and or automated industrial paper shredding equipment that will meet specified requirements. The Bureau is not issuing a solicitation at this time, but rather, would like to review product literature and pricing as part of market research to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement.
	BEP believes that such a shredder needs to be capable of shredding either US currency sheets (26 inches x 23 inches and 32.283 inches x 27.559 inches) and or currency notes (approximately 6.25 inches x 2.75 inches). The Bureau expects such equipment capacity to handle individual notes and or sheets through 100 notes or sheets at a time. Throughput shall be determined based on the equipment capability of shredding notes and or sheets.
	The shredded material must not exceed .375 inch square (9.25mm square), or .08 inches x .75 inches (2.1mm x 19mm). The currency material has special characteristics. The tear resistance at thread in machine direction is approximately 75 grams while resistance of the blank stock is at least 84 grams. The tensile strength (wet) of approximately 1.3 Kilo Newton per Meter measured cross direction on the blank paper.
	The equipment must be capable of 98 percent up-time.  Bulk shredding should be approximately 100,000 notes or sheets per hour. Note or sheet individual piece capacity shall be approximately 10,000 notes or sheets per 8 hour shift.
	The equipment must be capable of bagging the shreds or be attached to the BEP’s shred take-a-way system. The equipment must not exceed 5 foot high x 6 feet deep x 3 feet wide due to space requirements. Design must consider existing layout, power requirements and output.  Safety features include noise level, OSHA regulation 29CFR 1910.212 guards for rotating and reciprocating parts. Heated surfaces shall not exceed 135 degrees F during continuous operation. 
	
           Your response will be treated as information only. The Government will not pay for information requested, nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the government. Interested parties should send questions regarding this request should be directed to Donald Baron, Contract Specialist, 202-874-3143. .

<DESC>Air Force Services Agency, San Antonio, Texas is seeking GSA sources capable of providing a commercial off the shelf (COTS) Survey Data Analysis software Tool (SDAT).  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only.  This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential GSA sources and commercial products, and obtain prices.  It should be noted that the need for cost/price data, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is to assist in the planning process.  This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), or request for quotation (RFQ), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force. 

SDAT Overview:  The SDAT system will provide an electronic means of statistically analyzing data retrieved from various survey instruments distributed to personnel throughout the Air Force.  The software must be web-based, utilizing a database management system (DBMS) for storing inputted data.  The tool must allow for data input by either hand typing or text file import.  The tool must provide read-only views of data at all levels.  There will be three levels of organization with approximately 300 users.  The upper two levels of organization (higher headquarters and major command (MAJCOM) will have the ability to view all organizations under their purview.  The bottom level (bases) will have the ability to view data owned only by them.  Regardless of the method of development, the end result will be a software tool housed on the Global Combat Support System Air Force (GCSS-AF) framework at Gunter AFB, AL, and accessible only to authorized users via the Internet.  System Requirements:  (1) must be web-based; (2) must comply with Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card regulatory requirements for program log-on; (3) report views must be customizable by selecting one or more survey variables for analysis, and the type of analysis.  The system must present survey data as graphs, charts, or tabular format depending on the users chosen criteria.  Users may choose any variables for analysis and may compare data from selected time points.  This allows a comparative analysis showing changes over time such as improvements in market share, customer satisfaction, usage, etc.  The system must perform relevant statistical operations to include measures of frequency, percentages, central tendency, fit, cross tabulations, and missing/valid responses.  Reports must provide a visual representation of the information selected for each report. (4) the software must be able to operate in one of the following environments:  Solaris 8, IBM Websphere, or Oracle Server (9i). 

System Compatibility:  The application must be compatible with Air Force computer systems and comply with DoD and Air Force policies.  Interested vendors should e-mail their capability statement/information to MSgt Paul S. Bains, paul.bains@agency.afsv.af.mil.  If the information cannot be e-mailed, please mail it to MSgt Paul S. Bains, 9504 IH-35 North, Suite 250, San Antonio, TX 78233.  The capabilities statement/information should include as a minimum a detailed description of your product (including capabilities of COTS software, comparison of COTS software and the AFMOST system requirements/system compatibility, COTS software maintenance/modification/upgrade requirements), catalog, brochure, business size (i.e., small business, large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.), and prices (including maintenance costs).  All contractors must be CCR registered.  All responses should be received by 15 Oct 05.  If you have any questions, please contact MSgt Paul S. Bains.  The government is not liable for any costs and/or activity associated with providing a response to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Announcement of Workshops and Demonstrations involving National Land Command and Control Systems (LC2S) in Support of the Land Command and Control Information Services (LC2IS) Project
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has invited National Delegations to propose National Land Command and Control Systems (LC2S) to be demonstrated during the Land Command and Control Information Services (LC2IS) workshop to be held between 26-30 September 2005.

The workshop, designated by 1999/5HQ00592, has been authorized for implementation by the Infrastructure Committee within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program.

NC3A is expecting that National demonstrators will:

1. Participate in an Information Day workshop in support of a National C2 Systems Demonstration, organized 1 September in Brussels, to get additional information on the NC3A expectations for the demonstration and the technical description.

2. Provide a technical description of their Land C2 Systems, using the Target Architecture Framework (only the Service Architecture is expected: see attachment for more details), no later than 15 September 2005.

3. Demonstrate their systems (based on the scenario that will be provided by NC3A during the Information Day) during a workshop to be held 26-30 September (each National Land C2 System will be demonstrated during a maximum of one day).

PLEASE NOTE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WAS ONLY NOTIFIED OF THIS PROJECT AS OF 7 SEPTEMBER 2005, SO THE INFORMATION DAY WORKSHOP HAS ALREADY PASSED. HOWEVER, INTERESTED FIRMS MAY STILL BE ABLE TO TAKE PART IN THE LATTER WORKSHOPS DURING THE WEEK OF 26-30 SEPTEMBER 2005.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has previously advertised a Notification of Intent (NOI) related to LC2IS, inviting bids from industry to Develop and Deliver Increment-1 of the LC2IS in Support of Land Staffs. Firms interested in pursuing this LC2S workshop demonstration are also encouraged to consider bidding on the LC2IS project, which can be found on the Federal Business Opportunities website by doing a search for IFB-CO-11715-LC2IS under Solicitation/Award Numbers, before its 15 September 2005 deadline.

ELIGIBILITY

If your firm would like to take part in the LC2S Workshop and Demonstration, it must first be nominated by your National Authority with the required Declaration of Eligibility. Requests for participation received directly from firms cannot be considered.

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 

The contracting entity is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has certified as eligible will be allowed to bid. A Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to the contracting entity.

In addition, you may request a copy of the Bi-SC AIS Target Architecture Engineering Methodology for describing National Land Command Control Systems to help you prepare your workshop demonstration. An electronic version (PDF file) of this document is available to U.S. firms upon your certification/nomination.

<SUBJECT>A--PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY DOCUMENT (POD) FOR DESTINY MISSION
<DESC>The Goddard Space Flight Center’s Destiny mission team is developing a proposal to submit in response to the upcoming NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for NASA-DOE Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) concepts.  The proposed mission concept is called Destiny, which consists of the full suite of hardware and software capabilities necessary to conduct a space-based JDEM science investigation.  The key hardware elements include the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), Science Instrument and Fine Guidance System (SI/FGS), and the spacecraft bus.  The goal of the concept study is to develop a mission architecture to be proposed for the JDEM Announcement of Opportunity (AO), to be released no sooner than Spring of 2007.  Thus, this proposal effort is comprised of two phases: the JDEM NRA for mission concept studies and the JDEM AO.  NASA HQ is expected to select one or more mission concepts for study from the NRA.  This study will be ~2 years in duration, and the results of this study, in addition to fulfilling the obligations of the NRA, will be used to propose to the JDEM AO. This partnership opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner(s) to: •	Develop the Destiny mission concept and observing strategy •	Develop all or a subset of the following: o	Optical elements or all of the Optical Telescope Assembly o	Science Instrument concept o	Fine Guidance capability o	Focal Plane Arrays and Detector System o	Spacecraft Bus •	Collaborate in future JDEM development opportunities. Responders may propose a partnership to provide for all mission elements, a single element, or any subset of the above elements.  There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the JDEM NRA proposal and JDEM AO proposal.  If the Destiny concept is selected in the NRA for study, some funding will be available according to the budget developed during the proposal preparation.  If Destiny is selected as a result of the JDEM AO process, the partner(s) will be funded according to the budget developed during the mission AO proposal phase. Questions about this POD should be directed to Dr. Jon Morse (Phone: 301-286-7923, Email: Jon.A.Morse@nasa.gov).  Final Due Date of POD Response Responses to this POD are due by 5 pm EDT on September 30, 2005. An electronic PDF document may be sent to the above Email address at this time.  This solicitation/synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	An ombudsman has been appointed. See Internet Note “B”.	The documents for this partnership opportunity will be in Microsoft Office Suite (Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, or PowerPoint 4.0) format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The WWW address, or URL, of the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51.

<SUBJECT>99--SEEKING OFFERS FOR NASA TV'S PUBLIC INFORMATION DIGITAL CHANNEL: OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE AND MANAGE PROGRAMMING
<DESC>Statement of Purpose The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks an unfunded collaboration or collaborations for creating, producing, and programming of broadcast quality television video products	on NASA related topics that include; Aeronautics, Space, Science and Technology for NASA TV’s (NTV) new digital Public Information channel. (For more information on NASA TV’s digital channels, see www.nasa.gov/ntv.)  The Public Information channel is available for broader programming styles that, if not directly about NASA projects, would be related to NASA interest, goals and missions.  NASA seeks a partner to provide high quality and informative programming, which would comprise newly created, previously produced by the proposer, pulled from the NASA archives, or from live special events. NASA is interested in reviewing proposals from organizations that support NASA’s mission, values, and goals, and that would strategically enhance the Agency’s ability to provide information on NASA’s projects and missions to the public by means of these media.  For more information on NASA’s vision and mission, please see  http://www.nasa.gov	. It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offers will result in the establishment of one or more non-reimbursable agreements that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization(s).  Proposals will be accepted for all or part of this opportunity. Also, one proposer could represent a consortium of organizations. Scope NASA Television is a resource designed to provide real-time coverage of Agency activities and missions, as well as providing resource video to the news media and educational programming to teachers, students and the general public. NASA Television’s multi-channel digital format and transmission system greatly enhances NASA’s ability to reach educational facilities, museums, and the general public.  This NTV channel is available for 24/7 programming that is widely available to the public.   The partner would work with NASA personnel cooperatively and would have editorial input (in accord with NASA standards and values).  NASA would offer access to NASA’s various physical and electronic archives as part of this collaboration, as well as specialized access for live events or personnel.  All decision making authority as to the selection, scheduling or content of programming on all NTV channels shall be retained by NASA. The term of this agreement is two years with option to extend five years for a total period of seven years. Benefits to Corporate Partner In addition to the unique access offered by this new NASA TV digital channel,  NASA may consider negotiating brand placement, limited exclusivity, such as “official sponsor/affiliate” designation and other naming rights, as well as other opportunities as part of this collaboration in exchange for the creation, producing, programming and managing of NTV content for this Public channel.  All creative concepts from the proposer regarding this opportunity will be considered by NASA.  However, consideration only will be given to those offers that are commensurate with the value of the above, and that reflect NASA mission, values and goals.   NASA Requirements and Evaluation Criteria NASA is looking for a collaborator to deliver the following: •	A minimum of 16 hours of new programming per month that is about NASA or related to NASA projects in order to enhance NASA’s ability to inform the public about it projects and their relevance to the American public. •	Manage the content of the new programs that the partner will create from a combination of new shows, previously produced NASA material and live events for a minimum of 12 hours per day.  The partner will program these new television products on this NTV public channel. •	Up to thirty percent of new programming should be relevant for ages 8 and above. •	All programming is free of charge.  •	Full understanding of the architecture for the Multi-Channel Digital NASA TV.  (Details are in Attachment to this announcement.) •	Partner to assume FCC requirements for programming (e.g. closed captioning) and to follow NAB guidelines. •	Schedule and milestones for delivering programming. •	Monthly status report with metrics. •	Weekly production and programming meetings Evaluation Criteria Overview:  Proposals will be evaluated on the capabilities to provide this product and service, the viability of the organization, the level of the team’s experience, the documented experience and success in television production and management, and the milestones for the start of broadcasting on the Public NTV digital channel and its ongoing operations plan.  All proposals will be evaluated on the documented success of the organization in the following areas: Technical Ability and Experience: 1.	Ability to provide quality, digital television programming that is factual, educational and entertaining.  2.	Success in programming and producing television content for major markets and in running daily operations for a digital broadcast center or digital television channel.  Operational ability: 1.	Ability to schedule and meet realistic milestones.   2.	Operational team experience (include information on location, points of contact and top-level organizational structure.) 3.	Projected schedule and milestones for accomplishing project. Financial Stability: 1.	Strength of market analysis and strategy analysis. 2.	Strength of financial plan and evidence of financial stability (include annual audits, balance sheets and appropriate documentation.) Other: 1.	Level of NASA assets and resources requested for the collaboration. 2.	Level of prestige of the organization, company and/or other government agency represented, and how its strategy, mission statement, values and goals reflect NASA’s. 3.	Level of additional value and benefits offered to NASA. Instructions Submittals should address all the areas to be evaluated as stated under “NASA Requirements and Evaluation Criteria.” The proposal also must identify what the proposer expects NASA to provide in terms of assets and opportunities for the collaboration, as outlined in the section entitled, “Benefits to Corporate Partner.”  This request will be open for 6 weeks following date of release of this announcement.  All proposals must be received by October 18, 2005, 4:30 p.m. Eastern, to be considered.  Submittals should be limited to no more than 20 pages, double-spaced, 1” margins using Times New Roman 12-point type, and may be submitted.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERICAL ITEMS.  The Department of Health and Human Services, Immediate Office of the Secretary, through the Program Support Center ; plans to award a sole source contract  to Prescience Systems Corporation.  The award will be made under FAR Part 12.   The Strategic Work Information Folder and Transfer System (SWIFT) is a custom built Correspondence Management system that was developed in 2000, implemented and maintained by Prescience Systems Corporation.  This system is mail enabled with an extensive proprietary object model to handle imaging, data retrieval and routing of documents.   This custom system is a large SQL database that contains document and workflow routing data, as well as custom visual basic scripts and tables to control the complex workflows and business logic.  The documents are stored in a highly customized document management system and work items displayed in Microsoft Outlook using eiStreeam’s Workfolder for the Exchange product.  Customized Outlook forms and views serve as the user interface to the system.  Web-based indexing screens and search/reporting tools are also employed.  In addition to managing correspondence sent to the Secretary, SWIFT manages the production of Regulations, Briefings, and the Secretary’s calendar.  Statement of Work:   Strategic Work Information Folder and Transfer (SWIFT) System Maintenance Provide maintenance for the Office of the Secretary (IOS) SWIFT system.  SWIFT includes the IOS Correspondence Control, HHS Secretary Forecast, IOS Green Sheet and Secretary Scheduling module.  BACKGROUND: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) IOS developed SWIFT Correspondence Control System in 1999 to route and track such documents as, Regulations, Reports to Congress, Correspondence, Memoranda to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary, Briefings for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Chief of Staff, Invitations to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Chief of Staff, Requests for Meetings with the Secretary, Assignments Made by the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary. IOS continues to rely on SWIFT to provide the HHS Secretary with timely responses to inquiries into the above list of documents. Offices thatparticipate in the use of SWIFT include: Executive Secretariat  (IOS/ES), Correspondence Control Center (IOS/ES/CCC), Scheduling Office (IOS), Chief of Staff,  Deputy Secretary, Secretary, Operating Division Executive Secretariat Offices (i.e., ACF, AHCPR, AOA, CDC, CMS, FDA, HRSA, IHS, NIH, SAMHSA, and PSC), Staff Division Offices within Office of Secretary (i.e., ASAM, ASL, ASBTF, ASPA, ASPE, DAB, EXO, FOIA, IGA, OCR, OGC, OIA, OIG, OPHS, PPO).  The SWIFT Green Sheet is a web-based application that allows ASPA to
organize/maintain news articles specific to HHS community.  With this application the Green Sheet administrator can with a single click review an article and choose to include it in the dayÆs edition of the Green Sheet so that the Secretary and OS OPDIV Heads and other designated employees can review on a daily basis.  The SWIFT Executive SecretariatÆs HHS Forecast module compiles significant events and activities from all of the HHS staff and operating divisions to be placed in the SecretaryÆs Weekly Report to the President.  Prescience Corporation developed this system in 2002.The Secretary Scheduling module of SWIFT allows the Secretary Scheduling and Advanced (SSA) Office to keep track of all of the HHS Secretary meetings and traveling arrangements. This component has always been a part of SWIFT but it had never been used until after February 2005 when SSA requested the use of this component.  Thus changes and modifications were made based the new secretaryÆs requirements.  
During the 1st quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Correspondence and Control portion of SWIFT will be replaced by SERCH.  SERCH is the Immediate Office of the SecretaryÆs Enterprise Records Correspondence Handling (SERCH) System.

The HHS Forecast and Green Sheet modules are not being replaced by SERCH at this time. However the Scheduling module will be replaced by SERCH.  Thus IOS will continue to use these systems until they are replaced or no longer required. Therefore yearly maintenance is required on these two systems while only 4 to 5 months of service is required on the Correspondence Control and the HHS Secretary Scheduling modules.  The work required under this contract will be performed primarily at the vendorÆs site and as needed at the HHS Southwest complex (in Washington DC).

Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background Investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative.  The following forms will be provided and must be completed:  (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor Preliminary Background Check Form.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract.  To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.  At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR.  Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.  Government Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.  (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual(s) presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Mr. Irving Levesion, 10 Inverness Lane, Jackson, NJ  08527-4047.
 
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  

Description:  The Government has a requirement to provide policy-makers with the Interagency E GPS executive Board (IGEB) and oversight agencies with recommendations as to timing, sequencing, number of satellite systems, military considerations, and the role of GPS in a GNSS.    

The IGEB was established by Presidential directive in 1996 to manage the Global Positioning System (GPS). Until December 2004 IGEB functioned as a senior-level policy making body chaired jointly by the Departments of Defense and Transportation. The new Presidential Directive established a National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Executive Committee, co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation or their designated representatives in order to place responsibility for GPS at a higher level and updated the description of agency responsibilities. 

The recommendations to the IGEB will be based on analysis of the benefits, cost, risks and other strategic alternatives.  A strategic cost-benefit analysis is necessary to support these decisions rather than a traditional-cost benefit analysis because costs and benefits depends on scenarios/assumptions about the future development and deployment of civil satellite navigation achieving objectives and risks. 
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this 
procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible offerors may submit a quote.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology, Large-Scale Coordinate Metrology Group 
(LSCMG), provides methods, procedures and artifacts for performance evaluation of large scale coordinate measuring systems.  One such system is a laser tracker, which is a measuring instrument that has a measuring envelope of approximately 35 meters.  In order to evaluate the 
performance of these instruments, the LSCMG is in the process of designing new, novel artifacts.  

The artifact described in the solicitation will be used as a support structure for targets that can be measured with these systems.  The distance between the targets, designed by NIST, will be the calibrated dimension of this artifact.  Consequently, the support structure should be rigid with a high stiffness to weight ratio, have low coefficient of thermal expansion and be easily repositioned into different orientation.  This will allow the artifact to sample the measuring errors over a large portion of the measuring envelope.


Quoters shall provide a quotation for the following:

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Carbon Fiber Beam and Support Structure for Prototype Development of a Laser Tracker Artifact meeting all of the following required specifications:

1.	Carbon fiber beam three (3) meters, plus or minus 100 mm: (a) Cross section minimum
90mm height and 50mm width; (b) May be hollow with minimum wall thickness of 10mm; (c) Absolute value of coefficient of thermal expansion less than 1 ppm Celsius; (d) Mounting holes along neutral axis and positioned at airy points; (e) Sealed ends; (f) Effective modulus of elasticity of greater than 45 GPa;

2.  Tripod mounting structure to hold the beam in horizontal, vertical, and inclined positions.  Possible inclined orientation may be discreet orientations as long as the beam may be positioned at a 45-degree inclined angle relative to the ground.  The tripod shall include integral fixtures to support the carbon fiber beam;
	
3.  No mounted artifacts or target nest along the beam length.  (Typically, this type of artifact has mounted spheres along its length.  NIST does not desire to have these as NIST’s application requires designing special use target nests.)

<DESC>Answers to questions:

Typically, the air
velocity inside a booth is 100 to 160 FPM. Based on some simple engineering calculations, the cross section of the booth is 24ft wide by 12ft high which equals a cross section area of 288 sq
ft. The booth spec is rated at 24,000 CFM, however 24,000 CFM at 288 sq ft would only equal 83.3 FPM inside the booth. In order to achieve 400 FPM, you would need to take to 288 sq ft and multiply it by 400 which equals 115,200 cfm or 230,400 CFM for 800 FPM. My question is what FPM inside the booth are
you looking for?
ANSWER: Per Bio we have to have a minimum of 100 FPM inside the booth so we need whatever is req'd to make that happen. 

Do we need to provide electrical contracting services to connect the electrical control panel that will operate the booth to the existing 460V power or will electrical services be provided by others?   
ANSWER: Yes we are going to need contracting services to connect the electrical control panel.

Do we need to provide an air compressor for filter cleaning operation, or is compressed air available at the job site? If air line is available, how close to booth location? We will need 1" air line rated for 90-100 PSIG. 
ANSWER:  There's already an airline in the area where the booth is going to go.

Do we need to install fire sprinklers inside the booth? 
ANSWER:  Yes we are going to need fire sprinklers in the booth. There is already a line in the room for them to tie into for the sprinklers though.

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
Number Note 1 applies.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group, which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of clause)

Amendment 2
Questions and Answers

 
The purpose of this amendment is to answer contractual and technical questions submitted before the specified cutoff date and time of October 29, 2004, 11:00 A.M. EST.  
 
The due date for quotes has not changed.  Quotes must be submitted to Ms. Gena Leake NLT November 5, 2004, 1:00 P.M. EST via e-mail [gena.leake@dcma.mil] or facsimile [(703) 428-3579].  ALL correspondence MUST reference the solicitation number in the subject line.
   
 
QUESTION 1.  Who will provide the actual part/inventory content?  If this is pulled from somewhere will you provide the contractor with the necessary non-technical support to gain permission to interface with desired system?
ANSWER:  The data comes from various Government databases.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to obtain and have all the required data available to fulfill the contract requirements. 
 
QUESTION 2.  The current configuration is licensed to 4 locations in the U.S. (Alexandria, VA; DCMA East - Boston, MA; DCMA West - San Diego, CA; Ft. Belvoir, VA).    
Worldwide access would have a substantial effect on the price of the copywritten data vs. 4 sites in the U.S.   
Can the bidder assume access to be the same as the current configuration?  If not, please tell me the new locations 
ANSWER:  

The current contract does not specify the number of site licenses or specific locations.  While there are overseas locations, the current contract price does not separately identify or price them.  

The following is the current configuration the Government is paying for:

Parts/Logistics - 10 simultaneous users
 
Specs/Standards - 5 simultaneous users
 
Sites:
  DCMA East - Boston, Ma
  DCMA West - Carson, Ca
  DCMA HQ - Alexandria, Va
  
Access is provided to all DCMA users (including overseas locations) via the above sites.
The DCMA overseas sites can be viewed at the following URL:  http://home.dcma.mil/dcmai/places.htm.  You must click on each field office to view the locations supported by each field office.
