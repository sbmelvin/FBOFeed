<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Idaho Technology Inc., 390 Wakara Way, Salt Lake, UT 84108 as the only responsible source that can provide the Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device R.A.P.I.D. System with advanced software.   

In compliance with the Commands Initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Expeditionary Medical Logistics Program applications, the only technically acceptable item which has (ILS) support is the R.A.P.I.D. System with advanced software manufactured by Idaho Technology Inc. The R.A.D.I.P System with advanced software made by Idaho Technology Inc. has been standardized for all of the Forward Deployed Preventative Medicine Units (FDPMU).  The R.A.P.I.D. is a field-hardened rapid thermal cycler with concurrent fluorescence monitoring.  The R.A.P.I.D. is capable of automatically analyzing samples for the presence of biohazard nucleic acid sequence using real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology.  Idaho Technology is the sole manufacturer and distributor for their biodefense products.  The R.A.P.I.D. is the only instrument of its kind commercially available for portable field biological identification, which includes proprietary reach back software.  These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the FDPMUs.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between FDPMUs.    It has been determined that no other manufacturer makes an R.A.P.I.D. System to these specifications.   
  
This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.

However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Idaho Technology, Inc.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Christina Boyd-Brown at christina.boyd-brown@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a sole source award to Don Haggen of Boulder Bend, LLC for the covered moorage for the 45 foot undercover CBP Marine vessel used in operations on the water ways of the Northwest.  This award includes four additional option years that can be exercised if CBP chooses to do so.   The justification for the sole source award for the covered boathouse is for operational security and officer safety.  To maintain a level of covert appearance to the public and therefore blend into other boat traffic the storage has to appear without Government markings.  We use undercover operations to further ongoing investigations, gathering intelligence and surveillance. 

This requirement needs the contractor to ensure that all taxes, insurance, and utilities are paid.  The contractor must also be able to provide a covered boathouse that is located on the Squalicum Harbor in Bellingham, Washington in order to meet our requirements for an easily accessible boathouse for the Marine Interdiction Agents of the Bellingham Branch.  

If you company is able to meet all of the requirements for the this procurement you must email the contact specialist at Michael.A.Hall@dhs.gov by the Wednesday May 27, 2009.

<DESC>Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition-Brand Name JustificationRENEWAL OF EMC NETWORKER LICENSES In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), FAR 11.105, and VAAR 811.104 the following brand name justification is provided.  It is requested that sufficient documentation be provided to allow evaluation of the proposed solution to meet the Governments requirements. 1.  Contracting Activity:Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of InformationVA Cleveland Business CenterOffice of Information Service CenterBuilding 31000 Brecksville RoadBrecksville, Ohio, 44141Acquisition Management Section    Agency Activity:Department of Veterans AffairsOffice of Acquisition and Materiel ManagementCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward, Austin, TX 787722.  Nature of Action Being Approved: The brand name justification is for the FY09 follow-on support of the timely renewal of EMC Networker licenses that are currently utilized at the Bay Pines Office of Information Field Office (OIFO) to backup and restore Weblogic application servers and Oracle database systems on all development and testing servers utilized by the Common Services development and Service Quality Assurance (SQA) staff. These Application servers and databases are critical in many different development and SQA efforts and timely renewal of the subscription/maintenance will ensure continued backup of corporate data, application technical support, and access to required updates to stay compatible with the RedHat Linux and Oracle licenses.  3.  Description of Service and Supplies: The EMC Networker licenses are critical to ensuring continued backup of corporate data, application technical support, and access to required updates to stay compatible with the RedHat Linux and Oracle licenses running on computer servers located in the development environment at the Bay Pines (BP) Office of Information Field Office (OIFO). The EMC network backup system and associated application software is the currently installed network backup system for all Common Services servers located in Bay Pines OIFO Common Services portfolio. The specific software license packages include:NETWORKER FOR LINUX - BUSINESS EDITION SERVER - 12 MOSNETWORKER MOD FOR ORACLE ON LINUX - 12 MOSNETWORKER CLIENTPAK FOR UNIX - 12 MOSNETWORKER AUTOCHANGER SOFTWARE 1-9 SLOTS - 12 MOSNETWORKER MOD FOR ORACLE CLT ORACLE 8 & LATER UX - 12 MOSNETWORK CLIENT CONNECTIONS - 12 MOSNETWORKER SERVER NETWORK EDITION - LINUX - 12 MOSTotal value anticipated: $13, 261.50.4.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1(c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  (a) Authority. (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1). (c) Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand name justification. (Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.)5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  As described in Sections 2 & 3 above, this procurement is essential to the government's requirement. EMC is the only manufacturer allowed to provide the services identified above for these licenses.  Procuring an alternative product instead of updating the license support for EMC Network would result in substantial duplication of costs through reprocurement, installation, and training, and it is not likely to be recovered through competition among other products.  In addition, the Government does not currently have the knowledge, nor can the knowledge be obtained due to limited rights data, in order  to update and maintain the software. 6.  Description of Market Research: In addition to SEWP contract research, significant market research was conducted to determine additional means of purchasing the requested items including GSA Smart Buy, FSS, and open source research. During this research, a cursory review of available alternative products was accomplished. It was determined that no suitable alternative products could meet the requirement. Market research concluded SEWP IV to be the appropriate purchasing option and the Fair Opportunity tool built into SEWP satisfies the effort to solicit from as many sources as practicable.   All SEWP orders are placed under existing IDIQ (indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity) contracts, and thus, are not required to be synopsized pursuant to FAR 16.505. FAR 16.505(b)(1)) provides that each contractor shall be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,00 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts. The Contracting Officer shall utilize the SEWP-IV RFQ tool, which automatically includes the contract holders within a selected class in the RFQ/Search process, to solicit vendors. The SEWP IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) is composed of five (5) groups of contracts. At a minimum, to provide Fair Opportunity as required by FAR Part 16, all contract holders within any one individual group must be provided the opportunity to quote.  7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  The VA will evaluate the quotes based upon Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). It is anticipated that two or more offerors will be received, and therefore a fair and reasonable price determination will be made, in accordance with FAR 15.101 and FAR 15.101-2, by evaluating competitive quotes that propose at least the same price or lower. Price competition is also expected from authorized resellers. Technical acceptability will be determined by vendors who offer the brand name.8.  Other Supporting Data: Market research indicated that the requirement is available on the SEWP IV GWAC. The requirement shall be solicited under SEWP IV pursuant to the memorandum issued by Robert T. Howard, Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology, on June 1, 2007. The memorandum instructs VA offices to use the SEWP IV contract for all IT acquisitions as of June 15, 2007. 9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  None10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None. 11. A Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.a)  Re-procurement of licenses other than EMC, which would duplicate the cost of the licenses, installation, and training.  b)  Procurement of unlimited data rights, and training or procuring knowledge within the Government to supply the required services.  This alternative is not currently available since EMC owns all rights to the software currently.The agency will continue to monitor the usefulness of EMC Network and the agency's satisfaction with the vendor's performance of software and support services.  Should the current product and/or the maintenance and support services fail to meet the government's requirements, competition will be sought in future acquisitions of this product.12. Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  (FAR 6.303-1(b))_________________________________        __________________Technical/Requirements Representative             DateI certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  (FAR 6.303-1(a), 6.303-2(a)(12))Since this contract does not exceed $550K, this certification serves as APPROVAL.  (FAR 6.304(a)(1))_________________________________             _________________Kari CozzensContracting Officer                                                       Date

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has a requirement to perform an Organizational Alignment (OA) study to determine options for DESC to implement an Alternative Fuels/Renewable Energy (AF/RE) Office/focus in support of ongoing and newly emerging AF/RE mission requirements.  In addition to the OA for the AF/RE Office, phase II will be performed to review/assess the current DESC organizational structure to determine the best alignment to meet current/future requirements.  The OA is to be utilizing the following phased approach:  

Phase I will provide a recommended office structure that supports meeting alternative fuels and renewable energy requirements for DESC in the short-term.  

Phase II will address options pertaining to how DESC will align itself organizationally to support current and emerging energy related mission requirements as well as determine the best organization fit for supporting DESCs planned migration into the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) scheduled FY 2012.

New mission requirements will require DESC to perform an enterprise-wide organizational alignment (to include the Regions) to determine where gaps and seams exist between current organization capability and the future requirements.  This requirement must be developed in accordance with the DLA One Book Guidance for Enterprise Organizational Alignment (EOA). These techniques will include, but not be limited to, eliminating obsolete practices; consolidating functions or activities; reengineering and restructuring organizations, functions, or activities; and adopting industry best business practices.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis a Quantitative Sweat Measurement System with WR Medical Electronics co., 123 North Second Street, Stillwater, MN 55082-5047. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 339112 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The NINDS Clinical EMG lab is expanding its capabilities to provide autonomic testing for the clinical center. The Q-Sweat Quantitative Sweat Measurement system will be used to evaluate patients with small fiber neuropathies or other evidence of autonomic dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system. It has the potential to be incorporated into clinical protocols for better characterization of disease or disease processes. The Q-sweat system is a device that tests the integrity of the post-ganglionic sympathetic sudomotor response in the evaluation of autonomic dysfunction. It provides non-invasive measurements of resting and persistent sweat activity on the skin and has four channel capability that allows sweat activity to be studied at several sites simultaneously. Use of this Q-sweat device in clinical studies has been well-documented in the literature and it is in use in major research institutes. The device will complement NINDS-EMG Lab's ability to test other components of the autonomic system integrity. NINDS-ERM lab has been able to perform limited testing of the autonomic system on Viking EMG machines but do not have the ability to test the post-ganglionic cholinergic system. The Q-Sweat system will provide NINDS-EMG lab this capability. The device is also compatible with the CASE IV Quantitative Sensory Testing machine which has been used for many years in the NINDS-EMG lab. <br />W-R Medical is the only known supplier of the Q-Sweat measurement system. In order to maintain compatibility with existing equipment in ongoing studies/experiments, it is critical for the EMG Lab to acquire the Q-Sweat measurement system with W-R Medical Electronics Co. who is the sole supplier of this device. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Office of Acquisitions, NIDA, on or before 11:00 AM ET June 1, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 on or before May 28, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a sole source five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC) to provide software, products, and services in support of the NAVAIR V-22 team in the areas of MV-22 and CV-22 avionics acquisition and engineering services, and avionics products, as listed below, beginning 01 January 2010 and lasting through 31 December 2014.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation and test software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform.   It is expected that rapid responses will be required to address issues found during the deployment and testing of the V-22 platforms, and RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting program cost and schedule: 

Avionics acquisition and engineering services:  
Includes avionics software and systems engineering, and prime contractor and subcontractor monitoring of new V-22 Block developments.  Also includes technology evaluations and demonstrations to support program planning, and developmental software testing.  Further engineering services are required in support of the Fleet Support Team (FST) for resolution of avionics user technical problems, and the transition from the legacy RTSC Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground System (AMEGS) to the new maintenance system for V-22. 

Avionics products:  
Includes V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) Fleet software suite releases; V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS) software releases; Situational Awareness (SA)/Blue Force Tracking (BFT) hardware and software products, and roadmap planning and conversion products.  Products include both software and hardware Configuration Items (CIs) to support production and post-production modifications.  To provide these various avionics products, including mission planning and ground stations, software and systems engineering, software design and development, and hardware and software integration and testing is required.  In addition, Government owned V-22 labs housed at Raytheon Indianapolis (V-22 Avionics Integration Lab (VAIL) and V-22 Electronic Warfare Systems Test Lab (VESTL)) are required for generation and testing of these products.  These labs are also utilized by other V-22 Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), such as the Electronic Warfare (EW) and Vehicle Management System (VMS).  Upgrade and sustainment of these labs is required to maintain current configuration with deployed, in-production, and in-development aircraft.  Deployment of personnel at Fleet and test sites is required for tasking described herein.  The development and sustainment of avionics software simulation products used by V-22 labs and other activities is required to sustain the capabilities of these labs and to develop software CIs.

The Navy intends to award multiple Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee/Cost Plus Incentive Fee/Firm Fixed Price Delivery Orders under this IDIQ contract over the five (5) year period.    As a result of an evaluation of responses received to a Sources Sought Notice posted 11 February 2009, it has been determined that RTSC is the only know company that possesses the engineering expertise and personnel necessary to perform the efforts associated with this procurement.  Note 22 applies.

Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract to Societte Etenne Lacroix Tous Artifices, 6 Boulevard De Jofferey, Muret, France, for countermeasure decoy flares to utilize in the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program.  Due to the nature of the requirement, a solicitation will not be issued to the public.  The flares will be tested against domestic and other foreign countries flares presently in inventory. 
The procurement will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2317(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the flares resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to the duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the flares.
Direct questions to Ms. Diane L. Pearson by e-mail: diane.pearson@navy.mil (preferred) or by phone (812)854-5201.  Please reference the last four digits of the solicitation number when responding to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Technical Assistance in Evaluating Options for National Healthcare Reform
<SOLNBR>OS4809
<RESPDATE>060509
<CONTACT>Clint D Druk, Phone 301-443-0403, Email clint.druk@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), intends to negotiate with Jonathan Gruber, Ph.D. on a sole sources basis for technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) 106-1(b) because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy DHHS requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be eight months. 

ASPE requires a technical memorandum on the estimated changes in health insurance coverage and associated costs and impacts to the government under alternative specifications of health system reform.  The requirement includes developing estimates of various health reform proposals on health insurance coverage and cost.  The alternative specifications to be considered will be derived from the Presidents health reform proposal.  This project is a continuation of work that Dr. Gruber is currnetly providing for ASPE.

Dr. Gruber is uniquely positioned to provide the analytic work ASPE requires based on over 15 years of experience in health care and health policy.  Dr. Gruber is a recognized expert in health policy in economics including being widely published in peer-reviewed academic and health policy literature on the effects of changes in health benefit designs on the cost of enrollment in health insurance.  Moreover, in order to estimate the impacts, Dr. Gruber developed a proprietary statistically sophisticated micro-simulation model that has the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private sector health care costs due to a large variety of changes in health insurance benefit design, public program eligibility criteria, and tax policy.  This model has been used for other health reform proposal.  Finally,  Dr. Grubers ongoing work with ASPE, using these proprietary models to help inform the Office of Health Reform, strongly positions him to meet HHS requirements the most efficiently, which is a key requirement in order for well-developed legislative proposals to be put forth for Congressional consideration as soon as possible.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency  Any interested source, in order to meet HHS requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) A recognized expert  in health policy and economics with special expertise on the effects of changes in health benefit design on the cost of enrollment in health insurance (2) a proven micro-simulation model with the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private sector health care costs due to a large variety of changes in health insurance benefit design, public program eligibility criteria, and tax policy (3) the ability to seamlessly and immediately begin working with ASPE and the Office of Health Reform No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted by June 5, 2009 at 5 p.m. eastern time to the point of contact listed in this announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army has a requirement to procure 249 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Wiring Harness Kits to update the existing MLRS M270A1, APU.  As part of the APU modification, an APU Fuel Pump was added to the M270A1 Carrier to bring fuel to the APU. The internal fuel pump wiring controls in the APU Governor Box resulted in the following false indications: with the Vehicle Master Power Switch at the ENGINE ON position, the APU Fuel Pump will continue to provide fuel to the engine even if the APU is not operating; in addition, the Fuel Pump Warning Lights cannot discriminate between the two vehicle Fuel Pumps, and as a result, the MLRS Fuel Pump Tester will give inaccurate readings. To alleviate the APU Fuel Pump run-on, a new diode cable will be added inside the APU.  APU Diode Cable Fix Kits (57K6628) shall include, 12520244 Installation Instructions for the APU Diode Cable Fix, 12517450 Cable, Diode, APU Fan (4W32), and 12517451 Cable, APU Signal (4W33).  This modification is necessary to alleviate inaccurate readings by the APU.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKForConsulting Services to the USGS Lunar Calibration ProgramPrepared by: Thomas C. Stone, USGS Western Region, Astrogeology Team20 March, 20091.0 INTRODUCTIONThe US Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Astrogeology Team, in Flagstaff, AZ, requires a contract for consu Iting services in support of the USGS Lunar Cal ibration program.2.0 BACKGROUNDThe USGS Astrogeology Team has pursued a NASA-sponsored project to provide the Moon as a radiometric reference source for calibration of remote sensing instruments in orbit around the Earth. This capability has been developed by photometric modeling to fit an extensive set ofobservations of the Moon acquired at the USGS by the Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO). The observatory facility, data reduction systems, lunar photometric models, and techniques for applying lunar calibration were developed under previous contracts with NASA.The USGS Lunar Calibration program receives continuing funding from NASA under contract NNG08HV32I. The Principal Investigator and Project Scientist is Dr. Thomas Stone. Activities of this program include reduction of the large and unique ROLO dataset to cal ibrated lunar images, development/refinement of spectral irradiance and radiance models of the Moon, and the continued application of these models to the specific geometries of lunar observations made by spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. The USGS also fields requests from government-agency satellite programs, domestic and foreign , for assistance in planning lunar calibration campaigns. The NASA research proposal that has provided continued funding for the Lunar Calibration program has budgeted for consulting services to assist with project tasks.3.0 SCOPEThe contracted work advances the efforts of the USGS Lunar Calibration program in the areas of: I) reduction of the ROLO observational data, including lunar and stellar imagery and observatory operations engineering data; 2) refinement of the lunar photometric models used for calibration of spacecraft observations of the Moon; and 3) planning for lunar observations by Earth-orbiting satellites.4.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS4.1Proposal to NASA ROSES-2006 announcement NNH06ZDA001N-EOS entitled " Enabling Longterm Consistent Calibration of EOS and NPP Data and Products Using the Moon," proposal number 06-EOS/06-0129.5.0TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS5.1 The contractor shall develop an algorithm and software for high-accuracy location of the center and limb of the Moon in ROLO images.5.1.1 Software shall be implemented as an IDL program to automatically process a list ofROLO image cubes and produce an output a file containing the cube identifier filenames and arrays of the location results for each band in each cube.5.1.2 The software routine shall be tested on a set of image cubes supplied by the USGS.5.1.3 The results shall include a report of runtime timing.5.2 The contractor shall process ROLO temperature sensor data and compare these with stellar irradiance residuals (both datasets to be supplied by USGS).5.2.1 The contractor shall determine any consistent relation, and shall research potential correction algorithms.5.3 The contractor shall process the inventory ofROLO stellar irradiance measurements and determine potential contamination by direct illumination by moonlight.5.3.1 The contractor shall compute the position of the Moon at the time of each ROLO star observation and produce a list of all star images for which the Moon was within a given range of angle from the star; specifically, an angular range around 8 degrees for which moonlight could have been incident directly on the ROLO detector focal plane.5.4 The contractor shall study the ROLO irradiance model inputs and coefficients (version 311 or later) to address a discontinuity in model results between the VNIR and SWIR bands at the wavelength crossover.5.4.1 The contractor shall research model forms that minimize this discontinuity across the full ROLO phase angle range without significantly increasing the model fit residuals.5.5 The contractor shall provide a software system for planning lunar calibration observations by spacecraft in low Earth orbit.5.5.1 The software system shall be designed to work for any lunation within 30 years forward from the contract period of performance, based on a spacecraft orbit specified by either general sunsynchronous orbital parameters or a set ofNORAD two-line elements.5.5.2 The software system shall include user-adjustable inputs to specify: allowable phase angle range, definition of sensor focal plane layout, spacecraft attitude acceleration and velocity capabilities, desired sensor scan rates, and desired coverage of space beyond the edge of the Moon.5.5.3 The software system shall accommodate user-selection of the lunations that meet observation requirements, user-selection ofa particular spacecraft revolution from a table of conditions for the selected lunation, and shall produce a "waypoint" table of spacecraft pointing directions and times that would scan the Moon successively across the sensor focal plane as desired.5.5.4The software system outputs shall include an estimate of the attitude maneuver energy requirements, based upon spacecraft moments of inertia.6.0DELIVERABLESThe contractor shall provide deliverables in accordance with the Reporting Requirements Checklist.REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CHECKLISTThe contractor shall provide to the USGS Lunar Calibration Project Scientist:I. Software and test results as described for Technical Requirements 5.1 and 5.5 above.2.Written reports for Technical Requirements 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 above.3.Periodic and final reporting on the Technical Requirements above, delivered at a time and in a format to be determined by the USGS Project Scientist.
It is the intent of USGS to award this task to Dr. Hugh Kieffer of Celestial Reasonings of Genoa, NV, due to his unique expertise in this field.  Should you believe you have the capabilities to execute the above-stated effort, please contact Dick Paprocki, USGS Contract Specialist, no later than May 29, 2009, at (916) 278-9327 or rpaprocki@usgs.gov.

<DESC><p>The AFRL/RWGG, Eglin Air Force Base, Valparaiso, Florida is conducting a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>The 5 Axis FMS located in the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) is a large hydraulically driven motion platform for testing guided weapon systems. The system is driven by hydraulic fluid that moves actuators. The actuators have shaft seals and face seals to keep the fluid from leaking around the shafts and into the bearing races. The seals on both of the yaw actuators appear to be failing. This is evidenced by the bearing packing grease being pushed out around the shafts which is normally caused by hydraulic fluid seeping into the bearings. As the problem progresses, hydraulic fluid will begin to leak out of the actuators. The repair for this problem involves removing the actuators, disassembly, replacement of the seals, reassembly of the actuators and reinstallation on the FMS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requested Work:</span></strong></p>
<p>Field service to refurbish actuators for the yaw axis on the Carco Five-Axis FMS</p>
<p>Work will consist of the following:<br />&#61656; Replace seals/o-rings for actuators (and rotary joints, if needed) for the following axes of the FMS:<br />o Inner Yaw-readout side<br />o Outer Yaw-opposite side of readout<br />&#61656; Provide field service personnel to complete on-site repair of the FMS axes listed herein.<br />&#61656; Price will include travel, travel time, local trasnportation, lodging and subsistence.</p>
<p>Interested parties with the ability to satisfy the minimum requirements should submit corporate information to include commercial brochures and/or technical capabilities of the proposed system. <br />This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions for future requirements.</p>

Project Title:  
Expansion and Validation of Invitro Assays

Request for Information (RFI):
This is a RFI in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  It is emphasized that this is a notice for planning and information purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can perform the following: 

Background:


Identified Public Health Gap & Critical Path Need:  Children in a gene therapy clinical protocol for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (X-SCID) have developed leukemia as a result of insertion and subsequent activation of known human oncogenes by the retroviral vector used to treat their disease.  This tragic outcome has led many investigators in the gene therapy field to develop novel retroviral vectors with the expectation that they may provide the therapeutic benefit that the gammaretroviral vector used in France provided to the children with X-SCID but with a reduced risk of tumorigenesis.  In an effort to develop and validate an animal model that can be used to assess the relative tumorigenic risks associated with new vectors, FDA and academic investigators will assess various vectors that are under development.  While the animal model that will be used in the study can reproducibly detect retroviral vector-mediated tumorigenic events, it is time-consuming (6-14 months before tumorigenic events are detected), expensive, and requires use of animals.  In an effort to develop a method that would be faster, higher throughput, less expensive, and not require animals, we have shown that ex vivo transduction of primary cultures of murine hematopoietic stem cells can be used to detect immortalization events when subject to prolonged in vitro culture, depending on the vector structure.  We propose that the in vitro assay would not substitute for an in vivo tumorigenicity assay, but may be suitable as an initial screen of new vector types, and if the new vector was negative or had a low rate in the in vitro assay, it would then be reasonable to proceed with the more rigorous and most relevant in vivo assay to look for tumorigenicity in the mouse model.  However, prior to instituting this type of approach, the in vitro method needs to be further studied and the assay needs to be optimized and developed in order to demonstrate its reproducibility, sensitivity, and ability to be sufficiently quantitative for comparison of different vector types that may transform primary cells by different mechanisms.  The goal would be to complement the ongoing study by performing the immortalization assay on the same sets of transduced cells that are going into the mice, and in this way, one could obtain side-by-side comparisons of the relative sensitivity of each assay, as well as obtain data to define the reproducibility and reliability of the in vitro method.  If the assay proves to be suitable, then future sponsors would have a relatively inexpensive and rapid (weeks vs. months-year) assay method to perform an initial screen of novel vector constructions for assessment of relative risk. The additional advantage of using the in vitro assay for initial screens is the reduction in the use of animals for tumorigenicity testing.  Availability of an in vitro method to assess the tumorigenic likelihood of new retroviral vectors in hematopoietic cells may ultimately translate into a reduced risk to clinical trial participants, along with economic savings to the sponsors developing these novel products, and a reduction in the number of animals used for safety testing.


FDA Objectives:

Define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.


Responses to the RFI should address the following: 

Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and capacity to provide the services with little or no disruption of services to the current users at the FDA.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective analysis of respondents' capacity and capability to enable FDA to examine, analyze, review, verify, improve upon existing and develop, if necessary, mechanisms related to food safety and defense (protection) to protect, promote and preserve the publics health and well-being.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting").

Part A: Technical and Capabilities--Provide a capability statement describing how your institution would define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation. 

Part B: Cost Estimate--Provide a cost estimate for the services and the number of hours to define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation.  

Part C: Organizational Conflict of Interest--If any, provide disclosure of business activities of your company, your affiliates, your team members and affiliates of your team members which create either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest to define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation.

Part D: Security Requirements--At project completion, while the generated data, information and recommendations are considered public property, describe your ability to provide cleared contractor personnel for the project ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

Part E: Business SizeProvide your business size, ie. Small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses.  Although anticipated NAICS code is identified in the Fedbizopps posting, all NAICS codes will be reviewed.

Part F: Small Business--Describe your ability to meet the requirements in accordance with 52.219.14Limitation on Subcontracting.

Responses shall be:

1.	Identified with the RFI number; and include: Companys name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.
2.	No more than ten (10) pages in length;
3.	NOT submitted using the marketing materials;
4.	Submitted to the email as indicated above.


SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE no later than 5:00pm, on Thursday, May 28, 2009, Eastern Standard Time.  The RFI response shall be e-mailed to: Karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  FDA makes no implied or in fact contracts by issuing this RFI.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDAs view of the information received.  Do not send any material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or identify information that is business sensitive will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice will not be returned.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 20 each Anemometer, Totalizing, Standard 3-Cup, 0-100 MPH, Automatic Reset to Zero, Manually Reset, Self-Lubricating, Replaces F104F With Correction Factor of 0.96, Center of Cups Installed 6"- 8" Above Evaporation Pan Rim, Mounting Hardware F105-MP1, Novalynx Model 200-2510NC. The Totalizing Anemometer is used in the National Weather Service, Cooperative Weather Observing Program (COOP) Evaporation Station Pan. The general characteristics of the 3-cup anemometer are not necessarily unique, they automatically reset to zero and it must be self-lubricating. There are two specific and unique design characteristics that require the sole source procurement of the Novalynx Model 200-2510NC. Government climatologic data sets are now collected with a correction factor 0.96 (1) to accommodate the change in standard anemometer hardware. Additionally, the mounting hardware and repair parts (2) are now stocked at the National Logistics Support Center. A change in the baseline anemometer would require a change in the COOP data collection and recording process at the National Climatic Data Center and in the complete logistics support system for the anemometer. The following is a list of associated hardware that would require change at a considerable expense to the Government: 1) Mounting Hardware, NWS ASN: F105-MP1; 2) Acorn Nut, P/N: T920720, NWS ASN: F105-MP2; 3) Hex Nut, P/N T9200721, NWS ASN: F105-MP3; 4) Cup Assembly, P/N: T920722, NWS ASN: F105-MP4; 5) Gear Train (MPH), P/N: T920753, NWS ASN: F105-MP5; 6) Upper Bearing, P/N: T920755, NWS ASN: F105-MP6; and Counter Assembly, P/N: T920758, NWS ASN: F105-MP7. The Novalynx Model 200-2510NC was evaluated and tested at the Government's expense to replace the F104, which was discontinued by the original manufacturer. At the time of the evaluation and selection the Novalynx Model 200-2510NC was the only mechanical-type anemometer with similar performance characteristic to the previously sole-sourced F104. The associated expense resulting from another product selection would result in costs that far out-weigh any market benefits or initial savings resulting from a competitive procurement. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from only one qualified source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Novalynx Corporation, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. The anticipated award date shall be within 5 calendar days after the date of this publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified equipment. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. The information should be submitted by email to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or send a fax request with an email address to telephone number 816-426-7530 ATTN: Karen Christian. Failure to provide the required information will deem your request non-responsive. The NAICS code for this action is 339999. This requirement is considered a 100% small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>NO SOLICITATION TO BE POSTED, ONLY SYNOPSIS.

These MATO contractors provide dental services for National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, Naval Health Clinic Quantico, VA, Naval Health Clinic Annapolis, MD, Naval Health Clinic Patuxent River, MD, Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes, IL, Naval Health Care New England branch clinics, and all surrounding branch clinics in the Northeastern Unites States.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is intended to provide notification of the use of funds authorized under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 on this contract.  The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, awarded a contract to Information Technology Experts, Inc. on March 12, 2008 for testing and stabilization of applications (stress lab) support services.  This contract is a modification to add Recovery Act funds.

This project will:
 Improve the delivery of mission critical farm programs by expanding reliability and responsiveness of e-Gov initiatives.
 Increase efficiencies in completing activities necessary to support mandated government program to assist farmers/ranchers/borrowers through modern technology. 
 Identify performance deficiencies found in FSA applications and allow remediation prior to production implementation.
 Identify dependencies and record unanticipated impacts.
 Implement best business practices in production implementation of new programs.  

In January 2007, FSA applications delivered on the web experienced extremely poor performance resulting in Service Center employees inability to deliver mission critical programs to customers.  A strategy was defined to support stabilization of FSA web application delivery which included building a separate Stress lab environment, and then performing in-depth stress testing of FSA applications.  Stress testing identifies performance deficiencies in the application code, hardware settings, software settings and database queries.  The lab provides an environment and resources to simulate a large number of users and determine where changes can best be made to improve speed and reliability of FSA applications.  Early identification of improvements providing opportunities to resolve issues will provide greater service to Agency customers by reducing time spent waiting for information to be processed for program participation.  
  
This project will allow the FSA the resources needed to continue stress testing applications hosted on the current KC Web Farm, and new farm programs are delivered with improved service levels and reporting abilities.  Overall, this will result in improved reliability and responsiveness of FSA farm program applications that are delivered to the FSA Service Centers customers.

The award was made as a sole source through the 8(a) STARS GWAC program pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) and awarded in accordance with FAR Part 19.8.

<DESC>The Justification below is being posted in accordance with FAR 6.305(a)JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONBased on the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) under FAR 6.302-1.Justification1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  	VISN 11 Contract Service Center	2669 Cold Springs Road	Indianapolis, Indiana 462222.	Nature/Description of ActionThis document sets forth the justification and acceptance approval for one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2). To establish a sole source contract with Planetree Inc. to provide advisory and assistance services to improve employee and veteran patient satisfaction and environment of care within the VISN 11 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). VISN 11 VA Medical Centers also seek to become Planetree affiliate hospitals. Contract period is to include a Base Year and two (2) Option Years with an aggregate estimated cost of $286,152.00.3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesPlanetree will provide advisory and assistance services, advice for improvements to physical environment of care, data collection and analysis, assessments and evaluations of current procedures and suggestions for training, decision-making, care, and architectural improvements.  In addition, Planetree will provide staff education and training, patient improvement strategies, and detailed project management planning.4.	Identification of Statutory AuthorityThe statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).5.	Demonstration of Contractors Unique QualificationsPlanetree has 30 years of experience in patient-focused care and is able to share research, policies and procedures, experience and knowledge from internationally renowned experts and proponents of patient-centered care.  The Planetree patient-centered care designation and certification offers significant market differentiation and prestige, national and regional recognition, access to a cadre of health care and design advisors, visibility as a role model and worldwide networking opportunities with other health care facilities who have already implemented Planetree's patient-centered philosophy and programs.  This contractor has demonstrated successful outcomes by improving the customer satisfaction scores of other health care organizations similar to the Medical Centers within VISN 11-both VA (e.g., Battle Creek VA Medical Center, VA New Jersey Health Care System - Lyons and East Orange campuses) and private sector.  The contractor has identified patient satisfaction breakthrough strategies that have repeatedly proven successful in other healthcare organizations.	Based on market research as indentified below, it was determined that although some contractors could provide a portion of the required services, only Planetree could provide all of the following requirements:"	Onsite, telephone advisory sessions"	Proven success in patient centered care principles with regards to space planning and architectural improvement."	Data collection & analysis"	Patient education about treatment & services"	Comprehensive network of resources in patient centered principles (newsletters, conferences, training sessions)"	Assistance and assessment of VISN 11 facilities regarding implementation of patient centered care."	Staff education and training that successfully leads to the cultural transformation of an organization to patient centered care principles."	Detailed project management planning"	Patient satisfaction improvement strategies"	Information literature to assist patients become more involved in their care"	Proven ability to collect & analyze progress assessment information and tailor facility specific plans for improvement"	Experience with focus groups specific to patient centered care principles.6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure a Variety of Potential SourcesA Sources Sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on December 24, 2008 seeking potential sources to provide the entire package of services required.  Four (4) responses were received and reviewed by the Contracting Officer and program officials.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable CostThis contractor will provide information (i.e. other than cost or pricing data), which could include commercial price lists and prices for similar or the same services provided to other customers, to assist the Contracting Officer in determining if the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable for the services to be provided. The Contracting Officer anticipates the cost of this procurement to be fair and reasonable.8.	Description of Market SurveyThe program official conducted market research including an internet search for patient centered care initiatives to determine whether there are other entities that could provide all that Planetree provides.  The search was unsuccessful in locating other sources able to match the level of experience required to successfully implement.  In fact, the word "Planetree" came up over and over again with health care organizations that are adopting, or have adopted the Planetree model.  Most other information related to patient centered care had to do with research studies, or organizations such as Joint Commission, etc.  In addition, the Contracting Officer posted a Sources Sought notice to FedBizOpps on December 24, 2008 to determine if additional sources were available to meet all requirements. Five (5) responses were received in response to the Sources Sought notice and reviewed by the Contracting Officer and program officials. Information was reviewed from the following firms:"	Planetree"	Southwest Research Institute"	Ideal Medical"	Professional Life Skills"	Advisory Board Company9.	Any Other Supporting DataNone10.	Listing of Interested Sources"	Planetree Inc.- 130 Division Street, Derby, CT "	Southwest Research Institute- 6220 Culebra Rd., San Antonio, Texas"	The Advisory Board - 2445 M Street, NW, Washington DC"	Ideal Medical - One Course Parkway, Suite 600, Atlanta, GA "	Professional Like Skills Mentors and Coaches - 3462 Nathaniel Street, Houston, Texas .11.	Actions That May be Taken to Overcome Barriers to CompetitionOnce the core patient centered care principles are implemented, the need to contract for Advisory and Assistance services of this nature will be reduced.  The option to continue to contract for affiliate membership will be evaluated at the conclusion of this contract.12.	Contracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), "Soliciting From a Single Source" to Seabird Electronics for SBE 32 Water Carousel and Associated Bottles. Seabird Electronics is the sole manufacturer and supplier of SBE 32 Water Carousels; thus, the only known source that can fulfill the replacement need of the SBE 32. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, the Government will consider all quotes received within five (5) days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete as a result of quotes received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>Provided hereto for informational purposes is the file documentation required at 13.106-1(b) to support soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>1. This justification is written to support the sole source acquisition of one (1) each Seabird Electronics SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler and Associated Bottles for the Marine Operations Center in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b), "Soliciting from a Single Source". The purchase of Carousel Water Sampler and Bottles are for use on NOAA ships in determining the chemical makeup of local waters. The water sampler system is considered mission critical and a major part of the foundation from which all observed maritime scientific studies are based.</p>
<p>2. The specific Carousel Water Sampler and Bottles requested is the Seabird Electronics SBE 32. The compatibility of the SBE 32 to work with current equipment aboard NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN is what allows scientists to execute research objectives.</p>
<p>3. The SBE 33 is the current carousel deck unit aboard the RONALD H. BROWN that provides real time data acquisition and control for the SBE 32 currently aboard. The software used to run the SBE 33 is included with the purchase of the SBE 32. The SBE 33 issues the commands to the water carousel actuators so bottles will open and close at desired depths. The ability to determine depths for water collection assists in gaining accurate data for the chemical makeup of local water. Seabird Electronics has confirmed that the SBE 32 is the only water carousel unit with the necessary component to receive commands from the SBE 33 unit board the NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN, thus a SBE 32 must be purchased to maintain compatibility.</p>
<p>4. It is determined that no other companies' products meet the compatibility needed between the carousel deck unit (SBE 33) and carousel water sampler (SBE 32), thereby requiring a sole source acquisition to Seabird Electronics.</p>

<p><br />This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source contract to Amirix Systems Inc, 211 Horseshoe Lake Dr, Halifax NS, B3S0B9. <br />The Government intends to award this contract on or about June 10, 2009.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) only one responsible source, which applies when supplies required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies will satisfy agency needs.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />NOAA Fisheries Service is dedicated to protecting and preserving our nation's living marine resources and their habitat through scientific research, management and enforcement. In 2000, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service established the Maine Field Station in Orono, ME to have more direct involvement in the conservation of the living marine resources in Maine, particularly Atlantic salmon. NOAA Fisheries Service shares jurisdiction of Atlantic salmon with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the federal level. Within Maine, NOAA Fisheries Service primarily focuses on fish in the estuarine and marine environment, while the Maine Department of Marine Resources and USFWS focus on the freshwater life stages. NOAA Fisheries Service also works closely with other federal agencies (particularly the U.S. Geological Survey), the University of Maine System and a wide range of state, academic, public and private partners. <br />For years scientists have struggled to understand the decline and slow recovery of Atlantic salmon, a once abundant and highly prized game and food fish native to New England rivers. Biologists agree that poor marine survival is affecting salmon in the U.S. and Canada, but specific causes are difficult to determine in the ocean. Small acoustic tags and associated technology may provide some answers. Thirty of 150 Atlantic salmon smolts tagged by NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Maine's Penobscot River and released in Brewer, Maine in mid-May have crossed a line of underwater receivers off Halifax, Nova Scotia, the first fish to be tracked using the new global Ocean Tracking Network. The acoustic transmitters or tags, which are about the size of the silver eraser holder on a pencil, were surgically implanted in May in salmon smolts that were each six to seven inches in length. Each tag has a unique identification code that transmits an ultrasonic signal every few seconds. To detect these tags locally, NEFSC maintains a network of more than 80 acoustic receivers that extend from Brewer, on the Penobscot River near Bangor, into the Gulf of Maine. When a fish swims near a receiver, its identity and the time of detection is recorded by the receiver. Once data is downloaded for the season, biologists can learn which route each fish took, how long it took to get to the Gulf of Maine and most importantly, which fish survived and where fish that did not exit the Penobscot River may have died. This information can help uncover the causes of mortality.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research equipment necessary to continue monitoring migrating fish species in coastal waters in Maine. The Contractor shall provide equipment which will work interchangeably with existing gear, data analysis software, and Access database systems that are currently owned and used by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. This equipment will be required to work with the existing infrastructure of equipment and software systems. In addition; this equipment will be used collaboratively with Canadian scientists in Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the University of Maine Orono/USGS as part of an integrated international monitoring system providing additional rationale for standardization.<br />Transmitters included in this requirement are the only equipment that can be detected by an array of 130 receivers that exist as a part of existing telemetry infrastructure. This ultrasonic array has been in place seasonally since 1996 and since 2007 some portions of the array within the Gulf of Maine are in the water continuously. These units will be networked with international research efforts as part of the global Ocean Tracking Network. To utilize this network NOAA needs transmitters annually that are detectable by the existing network. Implanting these transmitters allows researchers to understand mortality, behavior and movement of Atlantic salmon smolts each year and compare between years. The VR2W receivers that are a part of this order will be used to replace units that are in need of repair or lost during deployment and to add to overall capability. These receivers allow researchers to monitor transmitter tagged fish from fixed locations for several months without the constant supervision that is required by other receivers that are used to track transmitters.</p>
<p>REPORTS, DATA, DELIVERABLES<br />The Contractor shall provide: <br />1) 10 each - VR2W Coded Acoustic Receivers (69 KHz) with Bluetooth <br />Code Map -110 <br />Delivery to be on or before July 29th 2009<br />2) 400 each - V9-6L-A69-1303 Min&amp;Max delay times (30 to 70 seconds; nominal 50 seconds Estimated tag life of 67 days. <br />Delivery to be on or before May 1, 2010 to maximize battery life</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirements set forth. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit the agency to perform analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. local time,&nbsp;June 8,&nbsp;2009</p>
<p>All responses to this synopsis may be submitted via e-mail to Timothy Wampler, Contracting Specialist, at Timothy.Wampler@noaa.gov, with a hard copy to the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Eastern Region Acquisition Division, 200 Granby Street, Suite 815, Norfolk, VA 23510.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a modification to extend the performance period on contract W912ER-04-D-0004, Task Order 0014, with Fluor Intercontinental, Inc., Greenville, South Carolina.  This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.' This action is required to extend operations and maintenance services for the Strategic Counterintelligence Directorate (SCID) in Iraq for three months, with a potential three-month additional extension, due to the delayed award of a Multiple Award Task Order Contract intended to recompete this service requirement.  The current period of performance ends May 31, 2009.  Award to any source other than Fluor Intercontinental, Inc would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost that are considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition. This action will be awarded via a modification to the existing task order. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. All responses should be directed to Diane R. Bublak at diane.r.bublak@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquires will be accepted.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0003, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, West Point Project, West Point Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work:   1)  Upgrade three (3) campgrounds  to 50 amp electrical service and upgrade 11 primitive campsites to utility hookup sites;  2) Increase routine grounds, buildings, and facilities maintenance to include grass mowing, cleaning services, refuse removal, and minor repairs to accommodate the anticipated summer increase in campers;   3)  Perform maintenance on 10 existing toilet buildings; 4)  Prepare site for a  pre-fab toilet building to be located below the dam near a high use fishing area; 5)  Plan, layout and construct in-park water service connections for two (2) parks to adjacent public water sources; 6)  Use existing plans to construct a new gatehouse, park attendant site, and landscape adjacent grounds at the entrance to Amity Campground; 7)  Convert  six (6) existing vault toilets to waterborne facilities; and 8)  Replace shingle roofing with metal roofing on seven (7) picnic shelters.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 31 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing

<a href="mailto:alexanpa@id.doe.gov">Alexander-Johnson, Patricia</a>
<DESC>IAW FAR 12.603(c)(i) - This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Background
DOE-ID intends to negotiate two 12-month purchase orders: one with Nuclear Safety Consulting, and a second with A. Bill Beach, on a sole source basis for advisory and assistance expert review and assessment support services of DOE-ID's and INL's implementation of the new INL M&O Contractor Oversight Model.  
Mr. Miller and Beach have significant experience and expertise in the nuclear industry.  In addition, they are intimately familiar with both the Naval Reactors and Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight processes which are the basic models to be implemented here. 
The Government may require continued performance of these services and; therefore, reserves this right through FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. 
Authority for Sole Source
IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  In this case, it is determined services are available from only the sources specified as this is essentially a follow on contract.  It is also noted that this award will be made to a small business, which is encouraged by FAR 19.202-1.

The certificate shall state that preventive maintenance in accordance with the specifications of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has been performed and that the equipment is performing in accordance with the OEM's specifications such that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any one-time charges (including but not limited to repair or inspection charges) if such maintenance were assumed effective the day after the Contractor's performance ceases. The Contractor is responsible for bearing all costs associated with obtaining such certification at no separate charge to the Government.  Should the Contractor fail to issue the required Certificate of Maintainability in accordance with this clause, or should any equipment fail to perform in accordance with the certification, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any reasonable costs incurred by the Government for the purpose of bringing the equipment up to the required OEM maintenance level.  If equipment is acquired under this contract, without maintenance of such equipment being concurrently acquired under the contract, the Contractor shall issue a Certificate of Maintainability for such equipment at the time of delivery for each piece of equipment. The certificate shall state that the equipment is in such condition that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any charges to the Government. All charges required to obtain the requisite performance of the equipment, up to the later of the time the equipment is accepted by the Government or the warranty expires, shall be borne by the Contractor.  The time the equipment is accepted by the Government is the date that the Government determines that the equipment has passed acceptance testing, not the effective date of acceptance. The fact that the equipment may have been acquired with a warranty does not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this clause.  All contractor employees are required to sign the Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-Public Information (NPI) Agreement (Form FDA 3398) provided at website http//intranet.fda.gov/omp/forms/internal/FDA-3398.pdf.

Project Title:  BioPlex Suspension Array System with BioPlex Pro Wash Station

Background:  The Office of Regulatory Science, Divisions of Microbiology, intends to purchase an additional BioPlex Suspension Array System and a BioPlex Pro Wash Station.  FDA/ORA field laboratories already have this particular instrument. The technology that is utilized on this platform is specific for this instrument. Our Divisions primary responsibility is to develop methods that these Field laboratories use. Therefore it is essential that our protocols are developed to meet the Agencys mission-to protect the American public from consuming contaminated foods. 

This instrument is solely utilized at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC has developed a serotyping scheme to identify Salmonella species. In order to use their serotyping protocol, it is imperative that we have the same instrument. As with our PulseNet responsibility, the next generation of rapid identification of foodborne outbreaks may just well lie with this technology. Therefore, the Luminex technology must be used on the same instrument as CDC.

The Division of Microbiology has one BioRad BioPlex instrument. This piece of equipment was purchased to be consistent with the FDA/ORA field laboratories. Therefore the additional instrument will expand our present capability. 

The Bio-Plex Pro Wash Stations have been developed specifically for performing wash steps for the Bio-Plex (and other xMAP) assays.  We are required to follow the protocol and complete multiple wash steps throughout the assay.  Currently, our group has no means of automated washing which is critical for decreasing run-to-run variability and saves analyst time.   The Bio-Plex Pro Wash Stations are highly specialized to perform the processing of polystyrene and magnetic bead-based xMAP assays.  

Technical Requirements:   
1.  BioPlex Suspension Array System   QTY  1
This system is a multiplex platform that permits the simultaneous analysis of up to 100 different biomolecules (proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids) in a single microplate well.  The BioPlex suspension array is built around three core technologies. The first is fluorescently dyed microspheres, or beads, from Luminex Corp. The second is a flow cytometer with two lasers and associated optics to measure biochemical reactions that occur on the surface of the microspheres, and the third is a high-speed digital signal processor to efficiently manage the fluorescent output. These technologies are brought together in the Bio-Plex workstation.

2.  BioPlex Pro Wash Station   QTY  1
The Bio-Plex Pro Wash Stations have been developed specifically for performing wash steps for Bio-Plex (and other xMAP) assays. The wash station eliminates manual wash steps from Bio-Plex assays which decreases variability and increases consistency in results between experiments.  The Bio-Plex Pro II has the capability of vacuum filtration for the processing of polystyrene and magnetic bead-based xMAP assays.  Start to finish wash protocols in less than four minutes.

Deliverables:
The contractor shall deliver 30 days after receipt of order.  

Warranty:  Extended warranties for the Bio-Plex 200 System shall be provided for year 1 and year 2.  Warranties shall be for the product explicitly stated.

Project Title:  Vitek 2 Compact 30 System

Background:  The Office of Regulatory Science, Divisions of Microbiology, intends to purchase a Vitek 2 Compact 30.  This is an automated biochemical identification instrument which can identify/confirm bacterial isolates in 3  8 h.  It is the next generation and successor to the Vitek 1 system, which is currently used by the FDAs ORA laboratories for the biochemical identification and confirmation of pathogenic organisms found in regulatory samples.  It has recently been validation through AOAC Internationals Research Institute (certification number 020802), as part of a harmonized pre-collaborative study.  It should gain official methods status within the next year, which will enable its use with regulatory isolates. 

The purchase of the Vitek 2 Compact biochemical identification system is essential, since our Vitek 1 system will no longer be supported by bioMerieux in the next few years and the Vitek 2 is its replacement.  This system has been validated through AOAC's Research Institute and is in the process of obtaining Official Methods (OMA) validation status. Once it obtains OMA status, it can be used for the analysis of regulatory isolates and will be adopted for use by ORA labs.  We are required to only use validated methods with the BAM Salmonella method, since we develop and validate methods for the field labs and because we can be called upon to perform regulatory analysis.  The Vitek 2 biochemical identification system is the only AOAC validated system that is currently available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is FDA- 09-223-SOL-00059. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-31.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-541990- All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services; Small Business Size Standard is $7.0 Million.

The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for a contractor to provide and collaborate on research on the Delta Obesity Prevention Study. The National Center for Toxicological Research, Division of Personalized Nutrition and Medicine, is seeking a facility and team capable of hosting a 5 week summer day camp in the Delta region of Arkansas, and specifically in the towns of Elaine and Marvell, AR.  This summer camp will provide the foundation for scientific studies that accurately measure the inter-relationships between the genetic make-up and the dietary and activity-based interventions provided for camp participants.  This program is designed to model methods for personalizing health care measures. The camp will provide participants with the necessary skills to help delay or prevent the development of chronic diseases linked to lifestyle.  While the program is research oriented, it also provides educational material and learning opportunities concerning proper nutrition and increases literacy skills. 

Obesity and related pathologies are typically considered adult onset diseases that are now appearing in teens and children. Low intakes of energy and essential nutrients during pregnancy and early childhood have been shown to influence susceptibility to obesity and other chronic diseases years later. Although environment, including unbalanced nutrition, is likely the primary cause of the steep rise in the percentage of obese individuals during the past 20 years indicates an environmental cause, differences in incidence and severity occur between ethnic groups and between individuals of one ethnic group. We propose to analyze how individual children respond to improved nutrition provided at a summer day camp in Marvell and Elaine, Arkansas. Our hypothesis is that some children will be more susceptible to the effects of under-nutrition than others of the same ancestral group. To test this hypothesis, we will examine gene  nutrient interactions by (i) analyzing candidate genes that metabolize, interact with, or regulate a subset of vitamins, (ii) determining genetic ancestry using whole genome arrays, (iii) measuring blood levels of a subset of vitamins before, at the end, and one month after a 5 week intervention of more nutritious foods, and (iv) associating differences in blood levels of vitamins in each child before, at the end, and one month after the summer camp compared to caregivers who will not have access to the summer camp food.  Assessing household food consumption habits before and after the summer camp will test whether educational materials and summer camp nutrition programs influence choice of foods in these households. Associating an individuals response to improved nutrient intakes based on genetic analyses will begin the development of personalized dietary recommendations. Certain genetic make-ups are more severely affected by specific kinds of malnutrition compared to other genetic make-ups, even though no individual is immune to deleterious effects of unbalanced diets. Research studies must therefore include individuals from diverse cultures, regions, and genetic make-ups to gain a more complete scientific understanding of health and disease and to equitably apply research findings to address health issues.  Such evidence-based data will form the foundation for recommendations and actions that will reduce health disparities through nutritional and lifestyle modifications.

 
The successful program will have the following characteristics: 

	Multi-year experience with developing, managing, and hosting summer day camps with the following aims and missions

o	High Quality Academic Enrichment that includes cultural enrichment, parental engagement, intergenerational leadership, community involvement, conflict resolution, and social action.
o	Parent and Family Involvement. Parents are required by the successful applicant to demonstrate their commitment to the program and to their childrens education and development by becoming actively involved in the daily Summer Camp programs. They are required to participate in weekly workshops focused on the educational and social development of children, parenting, camp initiatives, and other activities that build parent empowerment and family success.
o	Health, Mental Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity. The successful program will have had experience with proper daily nutrition and emotional support for developing healthy eating habits in children.

	Multi-year experience collaborating with nutritionists and some experience with biomedical research activities. 
	Manage a 5 week summer day camp consisting of a total of 100 children in at least 2 geographically separate towns (50 children at each site).
	Trained professionals capable of organizing the camp and assisting with all logistical decisions and operations within the community
	Ordering food and supplies for the camp
	Providing interns trained and certified in SPARK (Sports, Play and Active Recreation for Kids), First Aid, and Human Research Ethics (as required by the Institutional Review Board.
	Provide activities for promoting the summer day camp and help provide explanations to the community through at least two forums prior to the initiation of the camp.
	Assist with educational materials for explaining nutrition, how scientific studies are conducted, and concepts regarding DNA and how our genes help determine who we are and our health status.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: RENEWAL OF MERCURY SOFTWARE LICENSES

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. FAR PART 13, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUEREMENT. THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEIGN REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32. 
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with a size standard of 100 employees. This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted competitive basis among companies that are authorized by HP to sell the required software.
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:

The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:

52.212-1
52.212-3
52.212-4
52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.232-33, 
52.217-5

NIST seeks to procure a renewal of the following Mercury software licenses that are used by the NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer, Applications Systems Division. These licenses comply with applicable standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended. NIST has already made a significant investment in the initial procurement of these licenses. If NIST were to replace the software licenses with a different type of licenses, NIST would also have to make an investment in new hardware and retrain its staff.  Also, it is not feasible to potentially change licenses for a particular use every year since it would cause disruption and isnt practical from an operational standpoint. Therefore, NIST is electing to renew its existing Mercury software licenses. Contract Line Item Numbers and associated quantities and descriptions of the license renewals can be found on the attached document

Note: The exiting license number for the above Contract Line Item Numbers is: 1033-5596-2640

ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

This addendum replaces applicable paragraphs in provision 52.212-1.

 (b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
    (3) Firm-fixed-price for each contract line item number, and any discount terms for those prices; 
(4) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments, if any; 
(5) Evidence that the offeror is authorized by HP to sell renewal of the required licenses as specified in the contract line item numbers in this solicitation.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a modification to increase the ceiling of current contract W9113M-07-C-0161 with FLIR Systems, Inc, Wilsonville, Oregon.  This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement'.  This action is to require the original manufacturer of the FLIR StarSAFIRE III to (1) Repair and Return of 20 sensors with Pro-Active Maintenance Kits and, (2) Data Analysis of Group 1 with Pro-Active Maintenance and Group 2 without Pro-Active Maintenance.

This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are not available.

     MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   
1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 
2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  
.	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D..	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof	of insurance..	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the	prime contractor including contract number and term)..

The background check:
(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).  (c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed atGovernment expense.
Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  
3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under "business access."  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor's expense.
4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.
9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  
Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror's submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror's.

<DESC>Solicitation #  1055350

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors that can provide quotes/proposals.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The synopsis, NAICS code 325413, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13, for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

Project Title:  Vitek 2 Compact 30 System

Background:  The Office of Regulatory Science, Divisions of Microbiology, intends to purchase a Vitek 2 Compact 30.  This is an automated biochemical identification instrument which can identify/confirm bacterial isolates in 3  8 h.  It is the next generation and successor to the Vitek 1 system, which is currently used by the FDAs ORA laboratories for the biochemical identification and confirmation of pathogenic organisms found in regulatory samples.  It has recently been validation through AOAC Internationals Research Institute (certification number 020802), as part of a harmonized pre-collaborative study.  It should gain official methods status within the next year, which will enable its use with regulatory isolates. 

The purchase of the Vitek 2 Compact biochemical identification system is essential, since our Vitek 1 system will no longer be supported by bioMerieux in the next few years and the Vitek 2 is its replacement.  This system has been validated through AOAC's Research Institute and is in the process of obtaining Official Methods (OMA) validation status. Once it obtains OMA status, it can be used for the analysis of regulatory isolates and will be adopted for use by ORA labs.  We are required to only use validated methods with the BAM Salmonella method, since we develop and validate methods for the field labs and because we can be called upon to perform regulatory analysis.  The Vitek 2 biochemical identification system is the only AOAC validated system that is currently available.


Technical Requirements:      QTY  1
A Vitek 2, automated biochemical identification system.  The VITEK 2 Compact with 30 card capacity includes sealer/filler/reader module, Compaq PC, laser printer, start up kit and installation.  


Deliverables:
The contractor shall deliver 30 days after receipt of order.  

Warranty: 1 year

Instrument comes with a one year manufacturers warranty which will be considered apart of the base year:

(Base year shall be during the one year manufactuers warranty) 
Option Year 1, service and maintenance agreement
Option Year 2, service and maintenance agreement
Option Year 3, service and maintenance agreement
Option Year 4, service and maintenance agreement



CCR:  Vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of the contract.  You may register by going to www.ccr.gov.  You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.

QUESTIONS DEADLINE:  All questions are to be submitted via email to Vida.Niles@fda.hhs.gov, no later May 28, 2009, 4:30 pm EST.

QUOTATIONS DUE:  All quotations are due to:  Vida.Niles@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 4:30 pm, EST on  June 16, 2009.

<DESC><p>Title: Amendment 4 to IARPA Wide Broad Agency Announcement</p>
<p>1.  This amendment changes and clarifies the original Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).</p>
<p>2.  Additional research topics of interest have been added to the amended BAA for the following office.</p>
<p>Incisive Analysis Office (page 6)<br />&bull; Automating the Specification of Meaning that is Implied but not Said: Can computers be made to recognize conventional inferences from implied but unstated meaning in naturally occurring interactions and in various languages? The contextual features and cultural assumptions that support the inferences must be specified.<br />&bull; Dynamic and Emerging Events and Situations: Understanding the features of an emerging event as it evolves through time and space allows decision makers to maintain an awareness of the situation and/or begin to shape a response. Of primary interest are algorithms that provide the definition, features, development, interpretation, and impact of emerging situations across time and space. Following such events across languages and across data types (e.g., text, blogs, speech) is required. Retrospective characterizations of events are not of interest.</p>
<p>3. Section 3.A. on page 8 of the amended BAA has been modified to clarify the eligibility requirement for offerors. In addition, text has been added to this section to address the use of a unique capability that resides at another government agency or FFRDC/UARC as part of a proposed seedling effort.</p>
<p>4. Questions may be addressed to dni-iarpa-baa-09-04@ugov.gov. Answers will be posted on the IARPA website, http://www.iarpa.gov/solicitations_iarpa.html.</p>

The NCI-Office of Acquisition has received several questions in regards to this solicitation.  They are as follows:

Question 1:  Is the irradiation to be performed on the intermediate bulk or the final filled product and will the product be thawed prior to irradiation? 

Answer 1:  The cells in the intermediate bulk are radiated prior to cryopreservation.


Question 2: Is there an existing source of K562 cells expressing GM-CSF that the client can provide upon contract award? 

Answer 2:  NCI does not have K562-GMCSF cells to provide the awardee.   Please contact the contract specialist stated in the original announcement, regarding information for a point of contact.


Question 3:  What is the growth media being used for cell expansion and the cell densities achieved? 

Answer 3: The growth media is Biowhittaker X-vivo 15 TM media with hygromyc in 1.2mg/ml.   The final density will be confirmed after award.     
                        
Question 4:  What cry preservative is to be used for final formulation?

Answer 4: Cryopreservation is used so the cells are viable, but not proliferating when injected, and secrete GM-CSF for several days after inoculation.

This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) Q8825090025. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. FAR clauses and provisions enclosed within this RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-28 and are available in full text through Internet access at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. This procurement is designated as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $12 M per year.
By order of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) Central Valley Region, the El Portal Wastewater Treatment Facility is directed to analyze for Priority Pollutants and Dioxin 17 TCDD congeners, on its receiving water and effluent. The State Water Board adopted the Policy for Implementation of Toxics Standards for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries of California (known as the State Implementation Policy or SIP).  The SIP states that the Regional Water Boards will require periodic monitoring for pollutants for which criteria or objectives apply and for which no effluent limitations have been established.  Accordingly, the Regional Water Board is requiring, as part of this Order, that the Discharger conduct annual (1/Year) effluent monitoring (Monitoring Location M-001) and receiving water monitoring (Monitoring Location R-001) of priority pollutants.  Priority pollutants are defined as USEPA Priority Pollutants and consist of the constituents listed in the most recent National Toxics Rule and California Toxics Rule.  The Discharger must analyze pH and hardness of the effluent and receiving water at the same time as priority pollutants.
NPS employees will collect the samples required by the NPDES permit and drive	them to a certified lab.  The lab needs to be within minimum driving distance, about 90 miles maximum and/or 1.5 driving hours, from the El Portal Wastewater Treatment Facility as the samples must stay within a specific time frame and temperature.  There are approximately 40 samples taken from the river and plant effluent which must then be put into a cooler with controlled temperature.  There is also a limited time frame for the samples once collected to be received at the certified lab.  
The analyses shall be performed at a laboratory certified by the CA Department of Health Services.  The laboratory is required to submit the Minimum Level (ML) and the Method Detection Limit (MDL) with the reported results for each constituent.  The MDL should be as close as practicable to the USEPA MDL determined by the procedure found in 40 CFR Part 136.  The results of analytical determinations for the presence of chemical constituents in a sample shall use the following reporting protocols:
a. Sample results greater than or equal to the reported ML shall be reported as measured by the laboratory
b. Sample results less than the reported ML, but greater than or equal to the laboratory's MDL, shall be reported as "Detected but Not Quantified" or DNQ.  Estimated chemical concentration of the sample shall also be reported
c. For the purposes of data collection, the laboratory shall write the estimated chemical concentration next to DNQ as well as the words "Estimated Concentration".  Numerical estimates of data quality may be by percent accuracy (+/- a percentage of the reported value), numerical ranges (low to high), or any other means considered appropriate by the laboratory.
d. Sample results that are less than the laboratory's MDL shall be reported as "Not Detected" or ND.
The list for Dioxin monitoring 17 TCDD congeners, see attached Table 4.  The laboratory shall report the analytical results of the effluent monitoring for each congener, including the minimum quantifiable level (ML) and the minimum detection level (MDL) and the measured or estimated concentration.  The laboratory shall multiply each measured or estimated congener concentration by its respective toxicity equivalence factor (TEF) value and report the sum of these values.

<p>Line item #4-5--6'8" or 68"? The sizes are typos - Answer: The 68 inch door is suppose to be 6 feet 8 inches (6'8") or 80 inches - corrections made below.</p>

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations that seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The OTI Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia/Middle East (AME)  Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and is based in Afghanistan.  This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance will be authorized for incumbents with dependents.    

The Field Program Managers principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.   The exact locations for these positions has not been determined, but the majority will be based outside of Kabul with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) or the District Stabilization Teams (DSTs) housed in Forward Operating Bases established, led and maintained by U.S. or NATO/ISAF military forces.  The Field Program Manager is expected to be in daily communication and collaboration with a variety of U.S. or NATO/ISAF military units including U.S. Special Forces.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITES

The work of the OTI Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee (e.g. the OTI Deputy Country Representative), the Field Program Manager will:

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.  The program will seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

4.  POSITION TITLE: OTI Field Program Manager (Multiple Positions)

5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a tandem position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-12 (salary range: $59,383 - $77,194), GS-13 (salary range: $70,615 - $91,801), or GS-14 (salary range $83,445 - $108,483)  equivalent level, non-locality pay.  If a candidate is selected at the GS-12 level, there is a possibility for advancement to GS-13 level. The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-12, GS-13, or GS-14 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.

Similarly, applicants who apply for only the GS-12 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-13 or GS-14 positions will not be considered for the higher graded positions if they have not submitted separate applications for each of them.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations that seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>This purpose of this modification is to add additional topic areas as follows.
<p>Delegation Management: Of interest are white papers for delegation-based access control for web services within the context of large enterprise systems. The DoD defines delegation of authority as the action by which a commander assigns part of his authority commensurate with the assigned task to a subordinate commander. While ultimate responsibility cannot be relinquished, delegation of authority carries with it the imposition of a measure of responsibility, the extent of which must be clearly stated. Similarly, access to enterprise services and information can be controlled through delegation of credentials by an authority (perhaps a service itself) as established by a formal semantic model and explicit policies. A delegation of authority service would govern the ability of users and services to delegate authority to other users and services to access domain-specific computer-based resources. This service may need to interact and negotiate with other delegation of authority services across domains. The development of such delegation services requires investigation into the impacts of dynamically granting and revoking delegations of authority on the fly, approaches for resolving policy conflicts, and methods of delegation across workflow chains involving both principals (human-in-the-loop) and agents (software applications and services). White papers should discuss the technical foundations and approaches for the following research activities: (a) Development of a semantically grounded model (or models) of delegation based upon, for example, Air Force Instructions (AFIs) that informally capture delegation patterns. (b) Using such a model, development of a capability to encode policies in a formal executable language. (c) Development of enforcement services to expose and constrain the use of a minimum set of required credential sets and their delegation subject to the models and policies defined in (a) and (b). (d) Automated proof-of-concept demonstrations for a small set of AFI procedures using services within realistic scenarios and workflow orchestrations.</p>
<p>Enterprise Information Lifecycle Management: Of interest are white papers for Mission-Driven Enterprise Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) for the Air Operations Center (AOC). The Air Force needs service-oriented architecture (SOA) based systems and information management services that provide information lifecycle management and optimized query performance. This research will investigate: (a) multiple type-based and mission-based information repository and archive approaches; (b) approaches to improve reliabilities and performance in a distributed environment; and (c) dynamic Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) approaches. White papers should include discussion of the following tasks: (a) Assess commercial ILM and HSM software and hardware based on Air Force Information Management (IM) context and quantify technical gaps between commercial offerings and mission needs. (b) Define and develop, adapt, or adopt ILM and Dynamic HSM services suitable for multiple repositories supporting metadata-driven query mechanisms (to include XML). Provide web service and language bindings (minimally to include Java). (c) Define and enforce content-based access controls based upon user credentials (e.g. SAML-tokens). (d) Demonstrate ILM capabilities in an emulated distributed environment using the AFRL Information Directorate EMULAB cluster.</p>
<p>Efficient Distribution of Large Data Objects: Of interest are white papers proposing a DoD-usable protocol for the efficient and secure distribution of large objects - like video or georectified imagery - using publish, subscribe and query via peer-based protocols, such as BitTorrent. The white papers should discuss the research, design, development, testing and delivery of a prototype application/implementation that: (a) leverages the BitTorrent protocol; (b) adds security of packets to encrypt all communications; (c) incorporates authentication of users/systems in network; (d) supports publish, subscribe and query capability; (e) works on a collaborative model for calculating share ratios, rather than the existing BitTorrent "tit for tat" algorithm; (f) explicitly leverages network locality; and (g) handles real-time streaming of information (e.g. video).<br />The recommended date for white papers for these topic areas is by 22 June 2009. DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. All white papers must be addressed to ATTN: Randall McIntyre, Reference BAA 05-06-IFKA, AFRL/IFSA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505. Respondents are required to provide their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA 05-06-IFKA. Electronic submissions to: Randall.McIntyre@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 2 to 3 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC.</p>
<p>No other changes have been made.</p>

<DESC>***Proposal Due Date changed to June 30, 2009 at 2PM (EST)******Revised Drawings and Specification additions attached to this amendment***Notes from the Pre-proposal site visit RECOVERY ACT: EMERGENCY ROOM REMODEL Project# R540-07-115. 1. This project is going to use Recovery Act Funds, so the Contractors need to pay close attention to the reporting required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment ACT. Pg 23, FAR Clause 52.204-11The projects will be looked at by varies people and will tracked because they are using this money. 2. 80% of the money needs to be spent by October 2010. 3. Look at Page 31 buy American Act, Products from outside the US will need to be approved by the C.O. before they can be used. 4. Contractors will need to provide detail estimates for all Divisions (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, General Trades, Fire Protection, etc.), if the VA can't understand how they got their number than the offer/proposal will be thrown out. 5. Look at the phasing, and provide a commentary, Phasing will be important for this project. 6. Offers will be due June 30, 2009, project will be awarded approx. July or August 2009, Construction Start Approx. Oct., Nov 2009. 7. The VA only pays for installed materials and after the VA has reviewed the installation. 8. Contractor will be expected to submit an Infection control plan based on VA standards, and this will need to be in detail. Due to the area of work and area's surrounding this project areaInfection control will be high priority. The contractor will have to access Central Sterile below this Area. 9. No Office Trailer or storage trailer is to be located on Hospital Grounds property. The site is tight and with other construction projects going on there is no space for additional vehicles.Contractors should propose the use of a shuttle to bring workers from remote site to hospital. Only one vehicle will be allowed to park on site, all other vehicles are asked to park at the far end of the over flow area or off site. 10. The new door to be cut in at stairwell 6 room 1223 between column line 18 & 19 along O, should be done as one of the first steps in the project. This will allow another emergency egress for the waiting area during construction.  11. Coordination and ordering of Materials for replacement of the Air Handling unit teardown, and rebuild will need much consideration due to the fact that this unit serves other areas and will require shutdowns of those areas. This will need to be reviewed by VA before the work begins. 12. This project area is adjacent to the MRI and vibration will be a concern, the contractor is expected to coordinate the work requiring vibration or could disrupt the MRI with the VA prior to performance of the work. 13. Non-related Price factors for evaluation can be found page 11, Table 1 of the solicitation.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE TO MAY 29, 2009. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED. 


A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. 

The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc. Our intention is to specifically identify small businesses. This notice is a Request for Information (SOURCES SOUGHT) for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation. 

B. Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally.  

CFSAN has a research project in place to develop methods for the isolation and identification of biothreat agents and conventional pathogens in foods.  The identification methods currently in place will identify a single agent in a food matrix, which is fine if there is intelligence such as clinical cases of infection that suggest the causative agent of the infection.  However, in the event of an unknown with either biothreat or conventional pathogens, separate methods would be needed to screen for all of the microbial agents of concern.   This analysis would require a large amount of time that could result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Using the multiplex approach such as the Luminex (Bio-plex) system multiple agents could be screened for simultaneously significantly reducing analysis time and removal of contaminated products from the US food supply. 

C. Objective: 

The objective of this potential requirement is to assist CFSAN in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents. 

D. Draft Project Requirements:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the necessary personnel, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the following:

To accomplish the requirements for this requirement the contractor shall have access to both a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) and a Biosafety Level 3 (BLS-3) laboratory registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) select agent program that will enable the contractor to obtain purified DNA from  fully virulent strains of biothreat agents such as Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., and Burkholderia spp.  The laboratory shall also have access to genetic material from conventional foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serotypes, Cronobacter spp., marine vibrios, Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., norovirus and hepatitis A virus..  This requires that the laboratory shall have access to strain collections of the above listed pathogens to complete the work required for this requirement. The facility isolating the genetic material  shall have a USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) import permit to receive specific strains of B. anthracis, F. tularensis, Brucella spp., and Burkholderia spp. that the Government may require for use on this requirement.  

The facility shall have a security plan in place to safeguard the data generated from this requirement.  It is highly desirable that at least one person working directly on this requirement has a security clearance at the Secret Level or above. 

The contractor shall have knowledge on the isolation of highly purified DNA from gram-negative and gram-negative bacterial cultures as well as viral cultures.  The facility shall have the capability to conduct studies and develop DNA-based reagents for the Luminex (Bio-plex) system for the identification of bacterial and viral pathogens.  It is highly desirable that the contractor has or is currently developing identification methods for the biothreat using the Bio-plex.  If these methods are not currently available, the contractor shall have capability to develop them rapidly and validate them for high priority biothreat agents and foodborne bacterial and viral agents specified by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  It is highly desirable that the contractor be familiar with the Bio-plex reagents developed for the CDC Laboratory Response Network (LRN) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHHS), and have knowledge of the validation requirements for reagents utilized by these agencies.    

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement and all services shall be provided in a timely manner
1.	All signatures will be designed using a whole-genome approach such that all available complete genomes of different strains of the target species will be compared using multiple genome alignment programs. 
2.	A consensus alignment using programs such as the Gestalt Workbench developed by Gustavo Glusman will be preformed from the alignments that contain the target sequence conserved among all input genomes.  To establish that the organism-conserved sequences do not occur in any other sequenced microbe, the consensus gestalt is compared against database of microbial organisms.  An algorithm will be used for electronic subtraction of sequences from the consensus gestalt that was not unique to the pathogen targets of interest and the result will be a uniqueness gestalt that is mined for potential signature candidates.  At this stage, a number of constraints specific to the type of assay and/or platform (See Table 2 below) will be imposed on the candidate signatures, further narrowing the signature set.  
3.	A final in-silico screening will be performed to verify that signatures will detect the pathogen targets and not detect any non-pathogen targets.  After automated signature design and electronic screening, a file containing primer/probe sequence information is automatically generated for electronic ordering.

4.	Assay format will be a single TaqMan RT-PCR signature comprised of an unmodified forward primer, an unmodified reverse primer and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe labeled with a 5FAM fluorophore and 3Black Hole Quencher 1.  Assays will be tested on using the appropriate PCR instrumentation.  Use of Cepheid Smart Cycler is highly desirable.
5.	Data from the single signature development will be provided to CFSAN prior to development of the multi-plex assay.
6.	Upon completion of TaqMan signature development, a multiplex panel consisting of multiple signatures per agent that can be used to amplify a single agent or multiple agents in a single sample will be developed. This multiplex will consist of probes with recognition sequences identical to TaqMan signatures developed and coupled through an 18 carbon spacer and a carboxyl moiety to polystyrene fluorescent microbeads or immunomagnetic beads as employed by the Luminex platform.  The forward TaqMan primers will be modified by the addition of a 5 biotin moiety; the reverse primers will remain unmodified.  Probe and primer recognition sequences will be identical to the corresponding TaqMan signatures.
7.	For the assay protocol, all signatures will be computationally designed with specific constraints on GC-content, melting temperature (TM), and primer-dimer formation (Table 2 above) to enhance multiplex capability.  
8.	A standardized one-step PCR protocol for bacterial agents and a three-step RT-PCR protocol for viruses using a commercially available RT-PCR kit will be developed for the PCR portions of the work.
9.	Endpoint thermal cycling will be followed by gel screening or Multiplex hybridization.  PCR amplification will be conducted using one-step amplification kits for ease of assembly and prevention of cross-contamination encountered with two-step procedures.
10.	Standardized amounts of background, target, and near-neighbor nucleic acids will be used during screening process.  The amount of DNA will be determined for each food matrix in consultation with CFSAN.
11.	Each signature will be analyzed for each of the following characteristics.  The values associated with each will be determined in consultation with CFSAN for each agent and food matrix.
o	Limit of detection
o	Repeatability
o	Specificity
o	Robustness
12.	The Cepheid SmartCycler is the preferred instrumentation for development of TaqMan assays and end-point PCR and RT-PCR for gel and Luminex analysis since this is the instrumentation available in the majority of the ORA, FERN and LRN laboratories.  However, assays developed on instruments such the BioRad iCycler and ABI 7000 96-well plate real-time PCR instruments that can be transferred to the SmartCycler platform are acceptable.  
13.	All reagents for all assays shall be available from commercial vendors.
14.	The  efficacy of the nucleic acid purification extraction and purification process will be assessed using known quantities RNA for the virus assays  (e.g synthetic RNA encapsulated by phage MS-2 capsid protein and used as both an end-to-end assay control and extraction efficiency control) and whole bacterial DNA from a non-related non-human pathogen such as Erwinia herbicola.  Efficiency of extraction will be accessed by TaqMan RT-PCR for RNA and by TaqMan PCR for DNA.
15.	Controls that convey important diagnostic information regarding assay integrity, including reagent addition, quality and concentration, assay operator performance and instrument stability that do not compromise or limit the screening capabilities of the assays shall be incorporated.   These controls shall minimize the likelihood of false positives and false negative results and incorporate PCR inhibition and extraction controls. Controls shall include but are not limited to:
i.	Instrument Control:  Luminex control to confirm that the reporter optics within the Bio-Plex instrument are functioning correctly.
ii.	Negative Control: A Luminex bead conjugated to DNA sequence unique from that of the target organisms to serve as a non-specific binding control in the multiplex PCR assay.  
iii.	Fluorescence control (FC)
iv.	PCR/RT-PCR Amplification/Inhibition Control

Base Year - requirement for retrofit of approximately 182 USN IMPLCs.
Option Year 1 - retrofit of approximately 216 USN IMPLCs.
Option Year 2 - retrofit of approximately 182 USN IMPLCs.
Option Year 3 - retrofit of approximately 27 USAF IMPLCs.
Option Year 4 - retrofit of approximately 175 RAAF IMPLCs.

This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to Raytheon in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; because they are the only qualified source which possesses the detailed knowledge of the IMPLC design to allow them to perform these efforts in a timely and cost effective manner.

(b) Option.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Note:  The resulting lease for this project is for the tenant, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  Due to the regulatory nature of MSHAs role over the mining industry, the Agency desires to avoid the appearance of any conflict with the industry, including being housed in facilities owned by a person or persons with an interest in the mining industry; thus a mine operator or mining business may not own 50 percent or more of the company or other entity owning the property to be leased.  These entities are not invited to submit sites/buildings for this project.  Any potential offeror who responds to the ad is required to submit a signed and dated statement indicating that he or she has NO more than 50% interest in the mining industry.

<p>The intent of this project is to Repair Parking Lot at Reentry Veh Fac 8415, Improving for Heavy Vehicle Access. This project involves grinding, repaving and concrete foundation installation. Project involves installing 2 concrete pads for unloading heavy payloads in the front of the parking lot and in the rear. The area needed for heavy vehicle access on the east side of the building will be pulverized down 6" in place and used for recycled base, after processing the material a 30% shrinkage will require importing additional base to meet the necessary grade for a 2 inch deep lift and 2 inch finish course, assurance that a 4 inch asphalt envelope for heavy vehicle traffic with a minimum of 6 inches of compacted to 95% aggregated base beneath the asphalt section. Topic Description for waste and disposal will consist of pulverizing the existing asphalt to recyclable reuse for road base, once it has been ground up to meet a gradation of minus one inch, then the processing starts. During the processing the 6" section that has been proposed does not have enough strength, after pulverization the material will be pull away so that two more inches of native can be removed and hauled to the base landfill, once the sub- grade has met the desired compaction, then the six inch pulverized section will be spread over the sub-grade, and then the compaction will start with the pulverized material water and additional base will be added to meet the 30% shrinkage. On the west half of the entire site, excluding the new concrete pads a 2" overlay, on the east half, with light weight vehicle access to facility parking. Installation of 2 concrete pads for heavy vehicle unloading and loading will need to be constructed to a 9 inch thick concrete section with # 5 rebar 18 inch on center, and a 12 inch sub-grade compacted to 95% below 6 inches of aggregated base.. Basic Work Detail includes: Demo concrete; Pulverize asphalt 6"; Compacted sub-base 6"; Stabilized aggregated base 6"; Apply 2" minimum asphalt patch; Apply 4" minimum asphalt (east half); Apply 2" minimum asphalt overlay (west half); Apply 1" minimum asphalt levelers (west half); Install drain inlet / 24" inlet to tie into 12" existing pipe @ the north west corner of lot.

<DESC>Rationale for Award: Reference Special Notice W91278-09-2-ARRA, dated and posted on May 5, 2009.  This contract action was not awarded as fixed-price because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).  Furthermore: 1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  The contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy. 5) The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />I. Contracting Organization</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Philips Research Site, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico <br />87117-5773. Contracting Officer: Ms Barbara Steinbock. Contract Number FA9451-09-C-0353</p>
<p>II. Description of Action</p>
<p>This acquisition is for the development of high optical quality LiF:F2-gain elements for spinning disk lasers using Russian LiF raw materials. <br /><br />III. Description of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract will be to place F2-color centers into the LiF raw material such that the material will lase at 1178 nm which is two times the sodium guidestar wavelength. Three LiF gain elements ready for usage in a spinning disk laser will be delivered to Kirtland AFB, NM. <br /><br /><br />IV. Authority</p>
<p>10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)</p>
<p>V. Applicability of Authority</p>
<p>The University of Alabama employes a scientist who actually developed the process for color center insertion into LiF while employed at the General Physics Institute in Moscow, Russia. No other sources are available in the United States.</p>
<p>VI.Efforts to Obtain Competition</p>
<p>The effort was synopsized, but no sources responded. If future efforts develop, there may be occasion to find competition..<br /><br />VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs</p>
<p>The capability does not exist at Kirtland AFB or for that matter elsewhere in the U.S. The project officer will make every effort to determine fair and reasonableness once the proposal is received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research</p>
<p>Most of the expertise in this field reside in Russia, fortunately, one of the original researchers on LiF color center lasers is now employed at the University of Alabama. Sufficient market research was performed to determine that the University of Alabama is the only supplier for this unique requirement. A synopsis was posted on 5 March 09 and no responses were received.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts - N/A</p>
<p>X. Interested Sources - N/A</p>
<p><br />XI. Steps to Foster Competition</p>

<DESC><p><br />GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION<br />Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition<br />Project # 5WV0034<br />Bureau of Public Debt<br />Parkersburg, WV
<p>I. Identification of Need:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration , Public Buildings Service, seeks authority to enter into a sole source leasing action for the Bureau of Public Debt at their current location in the J. Hintgen Building 2nd &amp; Avery Streets, Parkersburg, West Virginia by exercising a five year renewal option with cancellation rights.</p>
<p>II. Nature and Description of the Action being Approved:</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Debt's current lease contract GS-03B-30084 is set to expire on May 18, 2009 and includes one five year renewal option. BPD would like to remain at their current location in the short term by exercising the renewal option included in the lease in order to have this lease coterminous with their other leased location at 200 Third Street in Parkersburg, WV. By exercising this five year renewal , BPD will be able to have the necessary time to further develop their long term space needs and be able to consolidate their leases and operations in Parkersburg,WV in the future by combining these requirements into one lease location. By accurately developing their space needs, BPD and the Government will avoid expending costs associated with moving into temporary space that does not fulfill their long term space requirements or allow for them to have efficient operations. (i.e. requiring additional square footage).</p>
<p>III. Description of the Supplies or Services required to meet the Agency's Needs including the Estimated Value:</p>
<p>BPD currently occupies 28,570 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet (32,855 RSF) of office space along with 4 surface parking spaces in the J. Hintgen Building in Parkersburg, WV. The current annual rent for this lease is $470,921.39. This lease is set to expire on May 18, 2009 and provides for one five year renewal option. The original lease was awarded through the competitive procurement process.</p>
<p>Estimated Value: The estimated aggregate cost to the Government for this action is <br />estimated to be:<br />Year 1-5: $476,068.95 x 5 years = $2,380,344.80 which is derived from ($14.49X 32,855 RSF X 5 years)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Identification of the Statutory Authority:</p>
<p>In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by services available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency</p>
<p>V. Proposed Contractor's unique qualifications/Nature of the acquisition requiring use of authority cited:</p>
<p>Exercising the renewal option is in the best interest of the government to protect the Government's occupancy. Lease extensions are intended for periods not to exceed 2 to 3 years, which is insufficient time for BPD to complete their requirements development process and for GSA, to deliver a competitive replacement lease. A succeeding lease action would require a greater investment of time and resources from both the lessor and GSA (estimated 6 - 8 months of procurement time), and could potentially mislead the lessor of our long-term intentions. A renewal option allows GSA to leverage our resources to deliver an economically-viable interim housing solution for BPD. Also, in accordance with the requirements of GSAM 517.207(b), the lessor's performance under this lease has exceeded the Government's expectations for quality performance.</p>
<p><br />VI. Efforts to ensure competition from maximum sources possible:</p>
<p>In accordance with GSAM 505.101 (2), an advertisement was placed in FedBizOpps on March 10, 2009 to solicit interest in satisfying this requirement and no other sources expressed an interest in this advertisement other than the current Lessor. The Contracting Officer also contacted numerous Parkersburg realtors and other BPD Lessors in the Parkersburg area to see if there was any existing buildings that would meet the need of this requirement and no other alternatives were found.</p>
<p>VII. Determination that costs will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>Therefore, an annual rent of $14. 49 per RSF is deemed fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII. Description of the Market Survey and Results:<br /><br />In March 2009, a telephone market survey was conducted by contacting local realtors and Lessors in Parkersburg, WV. Through this investigation it was determined that there were no other existing buildings in the market that had enough space to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>IX. Other Factors Supporting Justification:</p>
<p>Agency Mission:</p>
<p>The J. Hintgen Building was built for the BPD and has satisfactorily served BPD's space needs. BPD has indicated their desire to remain at this location for the term of the renewal (five years) while they evaluate their long-term space needs and consolidation of other leases in the Parkersburg area to maximize their efficiency and mission. By exercising the renewal option, disruption of BPD's daily activities would be minimized. <br />Please see Attachments titled Cost Benefit Analysis Summary and Sheet.</p>
<p><br />X. List of other Sources expressing Interest in the Solicitation:</p>
<p>No other source has expressed an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XI. Future Actions to overcome Barriers to Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>By exercising a five year renewal option with cancellation rights, BPD will be allotted time to further develop their space requirements. GSA already has initiated discussions with BPD to explain its obligation to pursue competitive options with respect to this requirement. GSA will continue to work diligently with BPD so that a competitive procurement may be initiated in the future for ths space requirement. <br />I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. Agency requirements supporting this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition are certified as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>
