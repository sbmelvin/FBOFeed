<p>PART I INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Campus Challenge problem solving competition is an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Munitions Directorate. The purpose of the competition is to solicit innovative, potentially paradigm-shifting ideas that have the potential, upon maturity, to successfully address specific real-world problems of interest to the Air Force research community. This is accomplished through direct competition, ultimately among a small number of participants. Campus Challenge is a recurring event that could feature a different selection of participants each time. But the charter will always be the same-a challenge to match wits in devising solutions to real problems through the advent of new technology.</p>
<p>This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.</p>
<p>PART II RESEARCH PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES FOR MINIATURE SELF-DEPLOYING SYSTEMS (MSDS) IN CLUTTERED/CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS</p>
<p>The Urban/Cluttered environment represents an area that has captured military interest in recent years. Traditional aerospace research has focused on speed, precision, endurance, and stealth. However, the possibility of operating miniature systems in this environment brings about new challenges.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Munitions Directorate would be able to bring to maturation all the technologies necessary to allow the US Air Force to confidently pursue the development of a constellation of multi-agent platforms (operating in the air and/or the ground) that can maneuver autonomously. These constellations should be able to maneuver in the open or inside of structures.<br />These maneuvering systems need to be able to provide diverse capabilities to the war-fighter. They may be called upon for search and rescue tasks. The systems may be used to find and identify hazardous materials. They may be employed to detect and identify electronic devices such as computers, radars, or communication systems.</p>
<p>These miniature systems would presumably have the following characteristics:<br />a. Can be air-delivered to the vicinity of a target.<br />b. Can enter the target area autonomously - either airborne or on the ground<br />c. Can operate without recourse to Global Positioning System (GPS) assistance<br />d. Can accommodate a variety of payloads - sensors and/or target neutralization devices<br />e. Possess or have access to enough power to successfully execute the mission<br />f. Can communicate with each other or to a remote monitoring station<br />g. Can be self-disabling and tamper-proof at the mission's conclusion</p>
<p>Size is a consideration. It is desired that these systems be as small as possible while still being able to have the attributes stated above. It is not a necessity that these systems be re-useable after their given mission is complete. But that re-use capability would be advantageous. Therefore, system cost must also be a consideration.</p>
<p>The thrust of this problem statement is to provide the following:<br />1. Identify the key technologies that need to be developed to satisfy each of those seven characteristics. Some of the technologies may already be available.<br />2. Identify the current maturity level of each of those technologies.<br />3. Ultimately, provide a comprehensive technology investment roadmap in which the Munitions Directorate may choose to invest. This investment roadmap would be the most efficient path to follow to bring the required technologies to the requisite maturity level for sub-system integration and demonstration. Time to develop and cost to develop are both factors.</p>
<p>This statement of the problem is intentionally vague so the Munitions Directorate can solicit "out-of-the-box" thinking rather than rehashing already-established concepts. With that understanding, please think in terms of satisfying the envisioned missions of these systems as opposed to any specific characteristic that might not be germane to a truly novel approach.</p>
<p>PART III CAMPUS CHALLENGE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>This competition is divided into four phases: Letters of Intent, White Papers, Proposal Submissions and Campus Challenge Winner Selection.</p>
<p>Phase I -- Letters of Intent: <br />All students (undergraduate or graduate) and faculty of universities are eligible and encouraged to participate. The goal is to produce the best possible solution to the stated problem regardless of who participates. Participation from various universities and departments within the university is encouraged. The universities may team with industry partners, however, the university must take the lead. Only one letter of intent per university team should be submitted.</p>
<p>The letter must be received by 4:00pm CST 15 April 2009.</p>
<p>The letter shall include a synopsis of the proposed idea. All teams intending to participate must submit a one-page, single spaced letter of intent to AFRL/RWK (see the address in Part V below). The letters will be reviewed by the RW Campus Challenge Review Panel, and approximately ten teams will be selected to submit a follow-up white paper.</p>
<p>The criteria for this initial down select will be technological innovation and likelihood of successful system-level development within a nominal 8- to 12-year timeframe, as evaluated by Campus Challenge Review Panel. The selected participants will be informed and invited to attend a meeting to be held at or near Eglin AFB, FL to discuss the problem and the competition requirements in greater detail prior to their submission of white papers. Those not selected will be notified.</p>
<p>Phase II -- White Paper: <br />In Phase II the participants will be selected to submit a white paper. The anticipated date selecting the white paper participants is 31 May 09. The white paper is the most important factor in the Phase II competition. It should be specific and complete. All of the technical factors do not need to be addressed in the white paper, but the following should be included and emphasized accordingly in the white paper:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Problem requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Describe the proposed technical approaches to comply with the requirements specified in the Problem.</p>
<p>(3) Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to solve the Problem. All technologies or suggested approaches should be available for advanced or system-level development by the Air Force within the next 8- to 12-years after completion of this effort.</p>
<p>Preparation of White Paper: <br />The anticipated date for submission of white papers to AFRL/RWK is 15 Jan 2010. The white paper shall be limited to 10 pages or less, including title page, narrative, tables, figures, and references. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Print size is no smaller than 10-point type in Arial or Times New Roman. All white papers must be submitted in hard copy and electronic media (CD-ROM or e-mail) in MS Word or Portable Document File (PDF) format directly to addresses listed in Part V. On the cover page, reference the BAA number and you CAGE and DUNS codes. To do business with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 2007. Ten paper copies of the white paper shall be submitted; each must bear the signatures, names and departments of those persons who actively participated. No Air Force funding is available for preparation of the white papers or follow-on proposals.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of White Papers: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will be composed of Air Force scientists and technical experts. This team may call upon other government resources for analysis, evaluation, modeling, or costing expertise. Two white papers will be selected as Phase II winners and requests for proposals will be sent to these winners. Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase III -- Proposal Submission: <br />In Phase III, two participants will be selected to submit a proposal. The anticipated date for the Government's Request For Proposals (RFP) is 15 Mar 2010; proposals will be due 15 May 2010. The winners will be asked to submit proposals for a Development Plan describing how the Air Force could most efficiently develop the ideas presented in their respective white papers. Two awards are anticipated to be issued with the estimated amount for each award to be not less than $150,000. However, the government reserves the right to decline award and either proceed with fewer projects or request a proposal from among the original white paper submittals.</p>
<p>Preparation of Proposal: <br />Proposal Preparation instructions are defined in PART V of this BAA.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of Proposal: <br />Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase IV - Campus Challenge Winner Selection<br />Approximately eight months after the contract is awarded, each participant shall deliver a well-structured development plan. These development plans shall, as a minimum, consist of a technology investment roadmap, a development and transition schedule, and a detailed cost estimate. Their purpose shall be to provide the Air Force with a comprehensive strategy whereby the least amount of Government dollars can be best invested to provide all of the technologies necessary to realize the Problem solution within a nominal 8- to 12-year development period. Emphasis shall be placed on developing technologies with a high likelihood of successful transition to Air Force systems at the end of this period. Hence, an investment roadmap that merely recommends extended research grants would be unacceptable. The development plans shall include specific suggestions as to domestic technology vendors. Emphasis should be placed in two areas. The first is the innovative application of emerging technologies to solve the Problem. The second area of emphasis should be placed on describing a transition strategy that moves a technology from laboratory experiment to a viable system. The system should be at a level of maturity so that the Air Force can begin to integrate them into actual sub-system or prototype demonstrations at the end of the 8- to 12- year period, if not sooner. The Air Force reserves the right to accept, reject, or modify some or all of the recommendations presented in either or both development plans and is under no obligation to fund the implementation of the development plan. The Air Force will ultimately evaluate each of these two development plans and determine an overall Phase IV Campus Challenge winner. The overall winner will be notified, and will be presented the "Okaloosa Sword."</p>
<p>Basis for Determining the Campus Challenge Winner: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will determine the Challenge winner by evaluating the Phase IV development plans using the following factors in descending order of importance: feasibility, technology maturity, transition strategy, and Air Force investment cost (these evaluation criteria are similar to the criteria used for proposal evaluation). Feasibility is the Air Force assessment of the probability that the proposed solution will be successful. Technology maturity is the Air Force assessment of the degree of investment risk associated with a particular technology. Transition strategy is the step-by-step process that will logically mature a technology to the point that it becomes a viable component within a larger system. Investment cost is the total Air Force funding on a year-to-year basis that would be required to provide the requisite mature technology and to transition it to the point that it could be successfully demonstrated at the integrated system level. All proprietary technology or data, whether in a white paper, proposal, or development plan, should be clearly labeled. The winning development plan will be the one that clearly and simply provides the more credible, preferably less expensive, means to arrive at an effective solution to the problem for one or more munitions applications. It should be noted that tangible, proof-of-concept demonstrations that serve to verify a competitor's overall concept are encouraged. These successful technology demonstrations would enhance the Air Force's confidence in the feasibility of a given approach.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire, under single source procedures, one radome rated to 200 MPH for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) manufactured by L-3 Communications, Electronic Space Systems Corporation (ESSCO), Ayer, MA.  This radome will be used to replace the FAA's emergency stock radome.  The purpose of the radome is to protect the antenna systems from weather exposure, while allowing minimal interference to radio frequency (RF) transmission through the radome.  Each radome is comprised of several radome panels constructed of laminated fiberglass.  These radomes help to ensure continuous availability during all types of weather conditions.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with L-3 Communications, ESSCO in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  Due to supportability issues, any radome used in the FAA system must be manufactured in accordance with ESSCO proprietary data.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Technology Research and Development Team's Operation of New Large Aircraft (NLA) Research Program, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to evaluate specialized Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and equipment that are capable of aiding firefighters in gaining access to aircraft doorways from the ground.  Traditional ground ladders used for accessing aircraft can be dangerous to climb, extremely difficult to secure to the airplane, require multiple firefighters to setup, and do not always reach the desired doorway exit.  Some airports have structural ladder trucks, sky lifts or air stairs, but these vehicles take time to deploy and were not intended for ARFF operations.  The FAA is seeking information on vehicles, methods, or technologies that could provide firefighter access and/or passenger evacuation to a variety of aircraft, including NLA such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8.  Of particular interest are vehicles which can quickly deploy and be able to accommodate a variety of aircraft exit door orientations, including second level access. The FAA may also consider evaluation of access/evacuation vehicles that do not currently have ARFF capabilities (but have potential to be modified to accommodate this type of equipment) for use on the second level, of a double-deck aircraft. A technical review will be conducted of all responses. Responses found to be technically sound may be requested to participate in further evaluation at the FAA's NLA Fire Test Site at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida (just outside Panama City).
Responses will be accepted until October 31, 2009.  Both email and U.S. mail submittals will be accepted. Please send U.S. mail responses to Mr. Nick Subbotin, FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, ARFF Research Program, AAR-411, Bldg 296, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey, 08405, or via email to nick.subbotin@faa.gov. 
Responses should include photographs and information on the vehicle such as application, performance specifications, previous testing/uses, production status, and vehicle cost. This RFI is for information-gathering purposes only, as provided in the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS). This is not a solicitation or Screening Information Request (SIR). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. No solicitation document exists at this time. Financial reimbursement for use of any equipment will not be provided. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection Procurement Process, Subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a purchase order to JVN Communications, Inc. to provide the Gulf Coast Operational Support Facility (GCOSF) a technical upgrade to existing Stand-alone Interfacility Radar Simulator (SIRS) used in Standard Terminal Automations System (STARS) air traffic control test laboratory.  This upgrade includes supply and installation of server chassis, Simulation Drive Replacement (SDRR), Graphical Scenario Generation Tool (GSGT) software, remote user workstation (component of server upgrade), Operating System software updates, five user licenses (hardware dependent) with twelve (12) months support. 
JVN owns the intellectual property rights to all SIRS applications.  SIRS (formerly known as FAA Interfacility Radar Simulator or FIRS) produces National Air Space (NAS) interfacility data and multiple RADAR information, capable of reproducing this data from any supported RADAR approach control.  SIRS is also used within the STARS Central Support Complex (SCSC) located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) and supports several STARS test systems. SIRS and FIRS use SIM Drive System Replacement (SDRR) and Graphical Scenario eneration Tool (GSGT) at test systems located at the WJHTC and other ARTS IIE Operational Support Facilities (OSF).  SIRS are an intricate part of the OSF operational structure. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above required work, and the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Debra Monzo, no later than 12 noon, Eastern Standard Time, June 2, 2009. Responses shall be sent via e-mail to debra.monzo@faa.gov.

The existing MSE wall will need to be repaired or removed as necessary to construct the bridge.  Some of the existing temporary fix of soil nails and shotcrete will need to be removed as well.  

MP 10.5 work includes a 42 culvert removal and replacement with a 42 culvert and concrete inlet; class 5 riprap; 5 concrete curb; remove and reset guardrail; and MSE wall removal and reconstruction as necessary to install new culvert.

The estimated cost is $ 1 to 2 million and we expect construction work to start early September 2009 and finish around February 2010.  There are possible Mexican Spotted owls & Peregrine Falcons nesting within the project limits that will restrict construction activities. 

This is a difficult construction project in a short construction season located in very steep and rocky terrain.   No formal detailed road closures, except for 30 minute delays, will be in effect as all construction activities will require maintaining existing traffic flow.

In addition, Kaiser Permanente's existing databases will allow collection of information on health care service use of the cohort over the 18 month period. Finally, a fixed form module capturing information on family care giving and informal sources of support will be added to the existing computerized data collection instrument. This modification will enable KFRI to continue this research without delay, advance the work, extend data analyses, and enhance the value of the study to the government and science.</p>
<p>Kaiser FDN Research Institute is the only know n source with the capability to continue to provide the additional services described herein. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (KFRI) is uniquely qualified to provide these services because: they have sole access to the identity and contact information for the cohort of 200 adults with stroke enrolled in the current OMS-PAC study under the existing contract. Furthermore, implementation of the OMS-PAC study has led to effective methods of tracking participants over time, yielding exceptional follow-up rates and successfully capturing all necessary data elements. It is in the best interest of the Government to award this contract modification as a sole source because an award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and would create unacceptable delays to the Government in completing this important research.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available. Submission of any information provided in response to this announcement is purely voluntary and the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. Responsible sources that believe they posess the require expertise and capabilities identified above may submit a response within 45 days from the posting of this announcement which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses from responsible sources will be considered. .</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetics Branch intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Illumina, 9885 Towne Center Drive; San Diego, CA 92121 for a maintenance agreement for the government owned Illumina Genome Analyzer, S/N 300204 and Illumina Bead Array reader, S/N S149.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $6.5M. 

Period of performance: shall be for twelve months from date of award.

The Genetics Branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of cancer genetics. Investigating genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer is an integral function of The Genetics Branch. By using ultra-highthroughput, next generation sequencing, and whole-genome high-resolution beadchip reagents, we are able to study DNA/promoter interactions, gene expression, methylation status, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and investigate genomic rearrangements and the Illumina Genome Analyzer or BeadArray Reader at resolutions and informatics levels never before possible.

The contractor shall provide: 1) Two (2) preventive maintenance inspections per Service Agreement year; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty-eight (48) hours of first call; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; 4) In the event of software updates, the contractor shall provide Software Service in accordance with the manufacturers latest established service procedures.  Contractor personnel shall be trained by the manufacturer in the servicing of the equipment in order to perform service to this instrument. 

The Illumina Genome Analyzer (NTH #01738254, Ser. #300204) is the massive parallel next-generation sequencing by synthesis instrument, which has become a core technology for genome analysis and discovery in the laboratory as is related to the biology of cancer. High throughput sequencing is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology where the ability to generate every increasing amounts of sequence data is key. The extended warranty will allow the lab continue to generate sequence date relevant to research on the Illumina Genome Analyzer.

The Illumina Solexa Genome Analyzer service maintenance agreement can be solely provided by Illumina. Illumina is the only company with the ability to service the Illumina Genome Analyzer (NIH 401738254, Ser. #300204) and Illumina BeadArray Reader (NIH #01558759, Ser. 4S149) currently in the lab. Illumina is the sole source manufacturer of the Genome Analyzer and BeadArray Reader and is the sole source provider for the service of these instruments. The Selexas content related to the Genome Analyzer and BeadArray Reader is proprietary and protected under patent rights and thereby is unavailable from other sources than the original manufacturer. Use of any other service agreements on these instruments would void support of the equipment by Illumina. For these reasons, there is no other source known to the NCI capable of performing the maintenance needed on the instruments referenced in this procurement.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION
DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to
negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to COY Laboratory Products Inc., 14500 Coy Drive, Grass Lake, Michigan  49240-9270.

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-154-DDC.

The items to be purchased is:  (1) Item# 8375095--2 Person Polymer Hypoxic Glove Box with Auto Purge Airlock; (2) Item# 8528110--C02 Control System, Model AC100; (3) Item# 8543100--Humidified Incubation Box (small); (4) Item# SPEC020--Special Polymer Chamber; (5) Item# SPEC021--Special Polymer Chamber; (6) Item# 8400100--Microscope View Port for Polymer/Aluminum; (7) Item# 8513025--Feed Thru Adaptor; and (8) Item# 8537025--Atmosphere Filtration System, Re-circulating.

The Government's estimated expected delivery date is 4-6 weeks after receipt of the purchase order.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that COY Laboratory is the only one that custom manufactures hypoxic glove boxes large enough to host an inverted microscope for cell imaging with space left for routine cell culturing and experimental maneuver.  COY Laboratory hypoxic glove boxes have several key factors that are designed to maintain suitable cell culture, such as, maintaining constant temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity with a HEPA filter system.  The Laboratory of Biochemistry has already been using COY Laboratorys anaerobic glove box, therefore ensuring that many of the components of both glove boxes will be compatible. This instrument is important in allowing experimental procedures to be done inside the glove box without having to move the cells into room air.  Exposure to room air could pose serious problems for doing research on redox-sensitive proteins.

<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-ORF-09-008
<RESPDATE>061109
<CONTACT>Beverly C. Johnson, Contract Specialist, Email johnsonbc@mail.nih.gov - Aaron B Crawford, Contracting Officer, Email crawfoa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />The National Institutes of Health intends to award a sole source contract to Perkins + Will Architects (P+W) to provide A/E services for Post Design, Bidding, Construction Administration Services and Optional A/E Services for the Phase II Addition to the existing John Edward Porter Neuroscience Research Center in accordance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The contract vehicle for this A/E service is a Firm Fixed Price contract for a three-year period, with a one -year option. The total contract award value including the option year will not exceed $5M. NIH anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(d)(1)(B) to provide this service to meet mission critical requirements for the following reasons:
<p>&bull; P+W created the Phase two contract documents; they are stamped by a registered architect and Principal of P+W.</p>
<p>&bull; P+W has the professional liability of these documents since they authored and stamped them. No other architect or engineer could work to administer the construction of these documents stamped by the P+W principal without specific authority granted by P+W and no other architect would be able to totally accept the liability of these P+W documents.</p>
<p>&bull; No other group has the design intent knowledge that P+W developed during the preparation of the phase two contract documents. P&amp;W by virtue of being the author of these contract documents has spent thousands of man hours in their preparation and is the group most familiar with them.</p>
<p>&bull; No other A/E is familiar enough with the existing 100% documents to effectively assist the NIH in the required reprogramming and redesign of the floor plans.</p>
<p>&bull; P+W was initially scheduled to perform these services, but the contract vehicle expired before funds became available. The Porter Neuroscience Research Center (PNRC) was meant to be built in two simultaneous phases without interruption; however after the first phase was constructed the second phase was put on hold for funding reasons.</p>
<p><br />&bull; It would be extremely inefficient and not cost effective and probably would raise legal considerations if the owner of the documents engaged the services of any party other than P+W to provide A/E construction administration services for this project.</p>
<p>&bull; To recompete for these A/E services would require a significant amount of time that would delay the start of construction and the critical ARRA mission.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The building project is the Phase II addition to the existing John Edward Porter Neuroscience Research Center (PNRC) on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The site is located on the west side of the campus between Old Georgetown Road, South Drive, Lincoln Drive, and Convent Drive. Currently, Porter Phase I (Building 35) is operational, and will continue to be throughout the construction process. The programmed gross square footage for Phase 2 is 293,839 sq. ft.</p>
<p>Phase II will expand the Vivarium facility currently operating in Phase I, as well as provide Behavioral, Tissue Culture and Electrophysiology Laboratories, and Lab Support spaces with associated Break Rooms, Meeting Rooms, Offices, and lockers. Phase II will also contain an Imaging Suite. Non-Laboratory areas will contain seminar rooms, conference rooms, and a caf&eacute;.</p>
<p><br />Scope</p>
<p>The scope of services to be carried by P+W for the PNRC Phase II addition are as follows:</p>
<p>1. P+W Architects will provide A/E services for Post Design, Bidding, Construction Administration Services and Optional A/E Services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the CM. In accordance with the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) P+W will ensure compliance with the ARRA's requirement for Energy Efficient Buildings and Sustainable Design and Construction that Optimize Energy Performance, Employ integrated design principles and controls, Protect and conserve water, Enhance indoor environmental quality and Reduce environmental impact of materials.</p>
<p><br />2. As may be required, provide reprogram and redesign services. The 100% Phase 2 Contract Documents were completed by P+W Architects; but some reprogramming and redesign of the spaces will be required because of NIH changes in some user assignments. These Phase two Contract Documents also need to be reviewed for conformance to the most recent NIH Design Guidelines and assembled into the Contract Documents for construction bidding. They also will require some additional revisions to comply with the increased ARRA stimulus funding act Energy Efficient Buildings and Sustainable Design and Construction requirements.</p>
<p>3. Advisory Services will be provided in the following area:<br />The Government will also conduct an activation/occupancy phase, including planning, scoping, scheduling, and specifying, procurement, receiving, installation and fit out of new scientific equipment and furniture as well as relocation of existing equipment and the actual moves of the scientists. As an option service, P+W may provide advisory services as required to support this Government activity.</p>
<p>Services for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) and for a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) are not within the scope of the proposed effort. NIH intends to issue two separate solicitations to obtain these services for the Phase II addition to the John Edward Porter Neuroscience Research Center. <br />This notice of intent is not request for proposal A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330.<br />Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Beverly Johnson, via email to johnsonbc@mail.nih.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, June 11, 2009.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a sole source five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC) to provide software, products, and services in support of the NAVAIR V-22 team in the areas of MV-22 and CV-22 avionics acquisition and engineering services, and avionics products, as listed below, beginning 01 January 2010 and lasting through 31 December 2014.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation and test software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform.   It is expected that rapid responses will be required to address issues found during the deployment and testing of the V-22 platforms, and RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting program cost and schedule: 

Avionics acquisition and engineering services:  
Includes avionics software and systems engineering, and prime contractor and subcontractor monitoring of new V-22 Block developments.  Also includes technology evaluations and demonstrations to support program planning, and developmental software testing.  Further engineering services are required in support of the Fleet Support Team (FST) for resolution of avionics user technical problems, and the transition from the legacy RTSC Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground System (AMEGS) to the new maintenance system for V-22. 
Avionics products:  
Includes V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) Fleet software suite releases; V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS) software releases; Situational Awareness (SA)/Blue Force Tracking (BFT) hardware and software products, and roadmap planning and conversion products.  Products include both software and hardware Configuration Items (CIs) to support production and post-production modifications.  To provide these various avionics products, including mission planning and ground stations, software and systems engineering, software design and development, and hardware and software integration and testing is required.  In addition, Government owned V-22 labs housed at Raytheon Indianapolis (V-22 Avionics Integration Lab (VAIL) and V-22 Electronic Warfare Systems Test Lab (VESTL)) are required for generation and testing of these products.  These labs are also utilized by other V-22 Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), such as the Electronic Warfare (EW) and Vehicle Management System (VMS).  Upgrade and sustainment of these labs is required to maintain current configuration with deployed, in-production, and in-development aircraft.  Deployment of personnel at Fleet and test sites is required for tasking described herein.  The development and sustainment of avionics software simulation products used by V-22 labs and other activities is required to sustain the capabilities of these labs and to develop software CIs.
The Navy intends to award multiple Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee/Cost Plus Incentive Fee/Firm Fixed Price Delivery Orders under this IDIQ contract over the five (5) year period.    As a result of an evaluation of responses received to a Sources Sought Notice posted 11 February 2009, it has been determined that RTSC is the only know company that possesses the engineering expertise and personnel necessary to perform the efforts associated with this procurement.  Note 22 applies.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with PDI Ground Support Systems, Inc (PDI) of Cleveland, Ohio to modify contract N68335-07-C-0061, to procure Interim Support Item List (ISIL) items/components in support of an effort to re-build the front axle of the A/S32P-25 Shipboard Fire Fighting Vehicle.  These items/components are derived from a list of items/components that have the potential of failure during the 2 year interim support period.  With these items/components readily available, the front axle will be able to operate at full capability and will continue to support major mission requirements for the United States Navy.  PDI is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for this front axle design.  Therefore, PDI can currently supply the required ISIL, engineering data and retrofit the fielded vehicles in the most expeditious timeframe.  PDI Group has made substantial investment to acquire and maintain technical data and tooling to manufacture the A/S32P-25 front axle.  Any deviation from this standard could jeopardize the mission readiness and capability aboard United States Navy ships.    

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The software products will allow DMA developers to continue to create applications and deploy new functionality and software modifications immediately into the SSA lifecycle. The software products will also allow developers to easily script custom applications and deploy to hundreds of servers and workstations.

Lead Technologies Inc. owns all proprietary rights to the softwares source code, maintenance support, updates, upgrades, and fixes.  As such, no other source can provide the licensing or maintenance support for this software.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, along with a proposal and/or quotation, which SSA will consider.  The Government will not pay for information received nor does it intend to provide evaluation results to the sender(s).  Responses to this notice should be submitted in writing to sean.frey@ssa.gov by 5 p.m., Wednesday, May 27.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR A MEDIUM RANGE LEICA ABSOLUTE TRACKER COORDINATE METROLOGY SYSTEM .  The Naval Research Laboratory intends to award a contract on the basis of less than full-and-open competition to Hexagon Metrology, Inc. for an Absolute Tracker Coordinate Metrology System, which shall include a Leica AT901-MR Absolute Tracker, a laptop computer with PC-DMIS metrology software, and a system cart.  The required system will be used to support present and future rocket and satellite projects that require precise metrology of the instrument hardware.  The required equipment is a laser tracker system that measures three-dimensional coordinates very accurately over large distances by tracking a laser beam to a retro-reflective target held in contact with the object of interest.  It is the Government's intention that the required system will be functionally and operationally compatible with one or more portable articulating arm coordinate measurement machines to form an integrated metrology system for assembly and integration of space flight instrumentation. The required system shall operate as an absolute distance interferometer, with both the absolute distance meter (ADM) and the laser interferometer (IFM) measuring devices running simultaneously using a common laser beam path to provide redundancy of measurement.  Vendors who feel capable of providing the supplies stated above shall fully identify their interests and submit written data or other verifiable documentation that demonstrates conclusively the capabilities of their proposed equipment to meet the stated requirements within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required documentation will be determined non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.</p>

Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the U.S. Army Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Advanced Materials Branch and Organic Materials and Corrosion Branch are interested in advancing the state of the art in corrosion abatement, prevention and mitigation for weapon systems and other Army material.  The approach is rather than to treat corrosion as an after the fact maintenance issue, the thrust is to develop technologies, coatings and materials that a weapon system designer could use to greatly reduce the corrosion burden.  In essence, the material designer will have the information, tools and protocols available to address corrosion in the design of a product as to significantly reduce future maintenance and costs of ownership.  The Advanced Materials Branch and Organic Materials Corrosion Branch are interested in technologies that will extend the life of the weapons, vehicles and other components.

The submission dates are as follows:White Paper Due Date: 26 June 2009ARDEC Response to White Papers: 24 July 2009Proposal Due Date: 26 August 2009

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for high resolution marine reflection seismic data to be collected from the C1, C2, and C4 canals for a total of two transects.  The period of performance will be 06/15/2009-06/14/2010.
There are no option years for this requirement.
Walker Marine Geophysical Company, LLC. is the only known source for this requirement because they are uniquely capable of obtaining high resolution marine reflection seismic data in small canals and in waters ~1 meter deep.  This contractor is also uniquely qualified to process very high resolution multi-channel data particularly in the critical areas of near surface statics, velocity analysis, shallow migration, and marine shooting geometry.  Furthermore, Walker Marine uses their own proprietary software to handle correctly the marine geometry which, is critical to stacking the high frequency data previously acquired.  The original raw data which is being used in conjunction with the data that will be herein collected was collected by Walker Marine Geophysical Company, LLC. Therefore, in order to maintain continuity of data and consistency of results it is necessary to continue utilizing their services.
In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency, however, THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

<DESC>1.  The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) intends to solicit and award a competitive 8(a) award to a single source through a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) type contract with Time-and-Materials and Cost Reimbursement CLINs for Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Base Operations Support (BOS).  The Cost Reimbursement CLIN will be available for other supplies, training and travel requirements.  The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis.  This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to:  MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center.  Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15  30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians.  If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined.  The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation.  These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary.  The transition services are:  Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations.  When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice. At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments. All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the only official means for FGA BOS information dissemination. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a basic and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2016.<BR><BR>2. Draft solicitation W91260-09-R-0001 is posted, with attachments, for industry review.

<p>Project Description and Scope</p>
<p>As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government's primary biomedical research agency. Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability</p>
<p>The NIH is seeking to obtain the services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) at Risk. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government and upon acceptance of a GMP, the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision, coordination, appliances, equipment, transportation, and any other element or item, as required for full and complete execution of the work in accordance with the specifications and drawings for the project.</p>
<p>The building project is the Phase II addition to the existing John Edward Porter Neuroscience Research Center (PNRC) on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The site is located on the west side of the campus between Old Georgetown Road, South Drive, Lincoln Drive, and Convent Drive. Currently, Porter Phase I (Building 35) is operational, and will continue to be throughout the construction process. The programmed gross square footage for Phase II is 293,839 sq. ft.</p>
<p>Phase II will expand the Vivarium facility currently operating in Phase I, as well as provide Behavioral, Tissue Culture and Electrophysiology Laboratories, and Lab Support spaces with associated Break Rooms, Meeting Rooms, Offices, and lockers. Phase II will also contain an Imaging Suite. Non-Laboratory areas will contain seminar rooms, conference rooms, and a caf&eacute;.</p>
<p><br />The Phase II 100% Contract Documents completed by an architectural engineering firm in 2007; were reviewed and checked by the NIH; but because of funding issues the project did not go to bid or construction. Some reprogramming and redesign of the spaces will be required because of changes in some user assignments. These existing Phase II Contract Documents also need to be reviewed for conformance to the most recent NIH Design Guidelines and will require some additional revisions to comply with the ARRA for Energy Efficient Buildings and Sustainable Design and Construction requirements.</p>
<p>NIH intends to issue a separate RFP for a Construction Quality Manager (CQM) to provide services to assist the NIH Project Officer in the supervision of the performance of the A/E and the CMc in the projects for PNRC II.</p>
<p><br />CMc Scope of Services</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing the approved existing 100% construction documents. These existing 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to price their general requirements and fee for the Pre-Construction and Construction phases.</p>

<DESC><p>MARKET RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT<br />Source Sought Synopsis only.
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition and Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder (NOAA/AGO/WAD-Boulder) seeks information on behalf of the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) from commercial vendors capable of providing Martin Puplett High Resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) system. This system will be used for characterizing spectral transmissions of millimeter and submillimeter detectors.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The basic design of the FTS system proposed should be based on the Martin-Puplett design widely used in millimeter and submillimeter spectrography. The Martin-Puplett design at minimum consists of three linear polarizing grids in conjunction with two interferometer arms equipped with roof-mirrors. One of the roof-mirrors should be mounted on a controllable linear stage with total travel of 150 mm or longer to achieve unapodized FWHM resolution of measured spectra better than 0.5 GHz.</p>
<p>The input port of the FTS should couple to a hot thermal blackbody source (to be supplied by NIST) The chopped blackbody source should couple to the rest of the FTS optics via a parabolic mirror with ~f/2 focal length.</p>
<p>The output port of the FTS should be designed to couple to the NIST-produced receiver system with high efficiency, and this requires an output parabolic mirror with f/1.7 or faster.</p>
<p>Both mirrors should have minimum diameter of 160 mm to avoid non-negligible levels of diffraction of the coupling beams while keeping the overall size of the FTS system manageable and portable.<br />The linear stage and the source chopper should be supplied with the necessary control systems and provisions for data output to generic acquisition systems for post-processing and analysis of measured spectra.</p>
<p>Internal surfaces of the FTS optical chain should be baffled to reduce stray coupling.</p>
<p>The FTS enclosure should be reasonably air-tight to allow purging of the internal volume with dry air or nitrogen gas for moisture- and oxygen-free measurements of spectra.</p>
<p>The fully-functional FTS system should be capable of measuring transmission spectra in the range of 70-1000 GHz with the above-mentioned resolution.</p>
<p>Conditions for acceptance:<br />&bull; A complete design that demonstrates the above technical specifications.<br />&bull; Realistic delivery schedule of ~6 months or sooner from the date of order.<br />&bull; Previous delivery of a similar instrument for the astrophysics community that demonstrates the technical competence of the bidding company.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW:<br />&bull; Rapid scan Martin-Puplett polarizing interferometer.</p>
<p>Mechanical/Optical:<br />&bull; Martin-Puplett polarizing interferometer design.<br />&bull; Translation stage: Linear magnetic drive. Note: must be operated horizontal.<br />&bull; Large aperture optics: 160 mm aperture.<br />&bull; Rooftop mirrors 90o + 10".<br />&bull; High accuracy linear encoder with hardware Position Synchronized Output allowing precise data collection based on encoder position. Position capture mode is key to accurate frequency determination1.<br />&bull; The linear translation of 200 mm length provides a maximum unapodized spectral resolution of 0.0167 cm-1 over the wavelength range 2.3-33.3 cm-1. (0.5GHZ resolution between 70-1000 GHZ.).<br />&bull; Line positional accuracy typically one tenth of the selected resolution2. <br />&bull; Input collimating optics &tilde; 160 mm f/2.<br />Electrical:<br />High-performance USB data acquisition module. Includes:<br />&bull; 16-bit analog-to-digital convertor with 8 differential inputs (16 single-ended).<br />&bull; Software selectable input gains of 1, 2, 4, and 8 to provide greater dynamic range coverage.<br />&bull; One 8-bit digital input port and one 8-bit digital output port for control of external devices.<br />Software:<br />&bull; Basic control and data analysis software will be provided.<br />General:<br />&bull; Mass: &tilde;65 kg<br />&bull; Dimensions: TBD<br />&bull; Material: Stainless/Aluminum<br />Options:<br />&bull; Blackbody calibration source Infrared Systems Development IR-563.<br />&bull; Analysis software: Sophisticated analysis pipeline based on over 25 years experience operating FTSs in the field2.<br />&bull; Extended Norton-Beer functions3,4 widely regarded as the best in the field and far superior to ones commonly used.<br />&bull; Phase Correction: Forman method5<br />&bull; Spectral interpolation: Zero infilling<br />&bull; Fourier transform algorithm optimized for speed6.<br />&bull; Spectral processing: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, average.<br />&bull; Export spectra in variety of formats (e.g., ASCII, GRAMS etc.) for ingestion by standard spectral analysis software.<br />Request for Information (RFI):</p>
<p>Responses are sought from all size and types of firms to determine the degree of competition. For the purpose of this requirement the NAICS size standard for small business is 500 employees or less. The purpose of the RFI is to determine whether there are sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirements. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit in writing, company name, address, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, business type, and size; and a brief narrative regarding experience, knowledge and capability to provide the required services. Responses that do not include this information will not be considered. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Request for Information (RFI) for<br />The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC)<br />United States Atomic Energy Detection (USAEDS)<br />Network<br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Defense Information Systems Agency, DITCO-Scott PL8223, P.O. 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406
<p>Description:<br />PURPOSE: The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to procure Telecommunications and Network Services (maybe Bandwidth Management Services) in support of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) Network.</p>
<p>AFTAC is the sole DoD agency responsible for monitoring nuclear treaty compliance, whose mission has grown and developed, spanning more than 50 years of long-range detection. AFTAC has evolved into one of our nation's most unique resources by monitoring worldwide compliancy of nuclear treaties, supporting our nation's space programs, and providing information that helps protect everyone during emergencies involving nuclear materials. AFTAC has a network of sensors known as the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) network. It consists of a worldwide network of seismic technologies deployed to detect, identify, and locate a nuclear explosion underground, underwater, in the atmosphere, and in space.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>TARGET AUDIENCE: Only small businesses are requested to respond to this RFI to assist the AFTAC in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers small business ability to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses to the following criteria from small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517919. In addition to Small Businesses, this Synopsis is encouraging responses from qualified and capable Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Small Businesses, Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums and Teaming Partners. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether or not there are qualified and capable Small Businesses to provide the aforementioned service.</p>
<p>Two or more qualified and capable small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications to make a determination for a small business set-aside. Responses must demonstrate the company's ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14). Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of NAICS code 517919 are requested to submit a response to the Contracting Officer within 7 calendar days of issuance of this RFI. Late responses will not be considered. Responses should provide the business's DUNS number and CAGE code and include a statement of self certification under the NAICS code. Additionally, responses should include recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work. Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered. Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.</p>
<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum 8 page statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>1. AFTAC requires a communications network that can transport analog/digital formatted seismic data, voice, and files to, from, and between AFTAC and its seismic monitoring locations. AFTAC has an alternate operating location for data transmittal at Goodfellow AFB, TX. The communications network must have the ability to transmit data from the service points to Goodfellow AFB when AFTAC's primary location at Patrick AFB, FL is inoperable. The network will also be utilized on a case-by-case base to provide administrative services (.gov e-mail, file transfer) for AFTAC Detachment personnel located at the seismic monitoring locations. AFTAC network personnel will be responsible for establishing virtual private networks across the USAEDS network to provide these services.</p>
<p>2. Patrick AFB, Goodfellow AFB, and Seismic monitoring locations will be referred to as Service Points (SP) A, B, and so forth from this point forward. AFTAC (SP-A) at Patrick AFB, FL requires a global, full duplex, full period communications network connecting multiple SP's (point to point and point to multi-point) together. The government desires a digital/IP-based network and shall use 100% of the service 100% of the time to transmit and receive mission data. At SP locations where the seismic data is in an analog format, the contractor must provide analog to digital converters to transform the data into a digital format prior to entering the USAEDS communications network. Once the data reaches its destination, it must be converted back to analog for final processing. (This conversion only takes place at a few locations. All data going to SP-A or SP-B at (Goodfellow AFB, TX) will not require a conversion.)</p>
<p>3. The contractor-provided network must be able to provide the government with 3-5 IP addresses per SP location. AFTAC network personnel will configure government furnished equipment (GFE) with these IP addresses and coordinate with the contractor's network personnel to establish destination routing. The contractor is required to provide a network that is protected against malice, intrusion, and cyber threats. The contractor must have process controls (firewalls, access control lists, etc.) to reduce the likelihood that its products and services contain malicious functions, control the quality, configuration, and security of components or subcomponents, and have process controls to ensure that personnel in design, configuration management, test, operations, and security positions are trustworthy. The contractor must protect the USAEDS communications network against cyber threats. Threats to control systems can come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled employees, and malicious intruders. To protect against these threats, it is necessary to create a secure cyber-barrier.</p>
<p>4. In addition to the baseline requirements, the government retains the right to add or delete service points, and/or upgrade/change the data rates of the remote sites as required during the life of the contract. Any additions, changes, or upgrades that incur additional costs must be jointly agreed upon between the contractor and the government, and approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5. SP-A continuously receives data from all other Service Points. SP-B is the backup to SP-A, and shall have the networking capability to receive data from all Service Points upon network failures, or when requested via telephone, or e-mail notification from the Government's technical representative or Systems Control Element. SP-B is a hot stand by for SP-A. SP-B shall be configured to assume the communications responsibilities of SP-A either instantaneously, or within one hour of being notified by the government to swing traffic. Conditions causing SP-B to be activated are communications outages, communication exercises, weather events, disaster preparedness activities, etc.</p>
<p>6. This network requires diversity in routing and network path to ensure redundancy for mission data traffic.</p>
<p>7. The contractor has the choice of providing satellite, frame, leased-line, or MPLS services for any service point. Service points are identified with the type of communications services they are currently operating on. Some locations are extremely remote to civilization or reliable telephone line access.</p>
<p>a. The contractor will furnish all SATCOM and network equipment required to transmit and receive data from one service point to another. The demarcation point will be an interface for GFE off of the contractor's network device (netmodem, router, switch, or hub). <br />b. Protocols the government will utilize: TCP/IP Protocols (I.E. UDP, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, VoIP)<br />c. Maintenance Support (On call or Onsite country): The contractor will be responsible for maintaining equipment and responding to outages. The contractor must be able to either remotely repair or physically repair outages within as quickly as possible. <br />d. 24/7 Helpdesk Support: Support required monitoring the network, calling up maintenance, and providing notifications and updates to key government personnel.</p>
<p>8. The following support is required for each service point:</p>
<p>a. Monthly bandwidth (include separate line for foreign segment and landing fees)<br />b. Monthly, quarterly, or annual unscheduled / preventive maintenance fees<br />c. 24/7/365 Helpdesk services fees</p>
<p>9. The contractor will be responsible for all host nation approval and connection authority certificates for SP's residing in foreign countries. The contractor is also responsible for all fees and tariffs levied by foreign governments when pursuing telecommunications services and satellite frequency requests. These approvals/permissions must be verifiable by government personnel.</p>
<p>10. Below is a list of service point locations. This is not an all-inclusive list of SP's. It is a large portion to aide in determining what is required to provide the necessary services, and the regions of the world where the service will be provided.</p>
<p>Service Point A (Frame Relay/MPLS)<br />Patrick AFB, AFTAC<br />NPA/NPX: 321-494<br />CIR Data Rate: T1 (1.544Mb)<br />Backup Circuit: T1 (1.544Mb)</p>

<p>Service Point A will receive traffic from all Service Points with the exception of Service Point B. Service Point B is a standby for Service Point A. Service Point B will also have the ability to provide other services (SMTP, UDP, FTP, etc.) to some of the Service Points. Therefore, Service Point B must remain an active circuit in conjunction with Service Point A.</p>

<a href="mailto:angela.hook@us.army.mil">TACOM - Rock Island</a>
<DESC>TACOM Contracting Center is issuing this announcement to obtain market research prior to issuing a solicitation for explosive decontamination/disposal, disassembly and visual inspection of structures, foundation testing/disposal, and documentation preparation for the solvent recovery, load line 2, and miscellaneous areas at Indiana Army Ammunition Plant.  Please review summary of requirement below.  Request that interested parties submit capabilities statements and small business status/size no later than close of business Monday, June 1, 2009.  Requested information to be submitted electronically to Angela Hook at angela.hook@us.army.mil .<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>The objective of this project is to perform various decontamination, inspection and disposal efforts, which include: decontamination, disassembly and visual inspection of structures, foundation testing/disposal, and documentation preparation.  For all explosive decontamination activities, the con  tractor shall perform the efforts, and provide written certification and verify that the facilities and equipment are free of explosive hazards.<BR><BR>PROPERTY DECONTAMINATION: The buildings and equipment identified shall be decontaminated in accordance with DoD Instruction 4140.62, dated 25 Nov 08 and CENNC-OE-CX Document 06-03 dated 27 Jan 06.  Perform testing of residual material (post burn ash/soils) in support of appropriate off-site disposal. Testing shall consist of the EPA 8330 test method for explosives and a composite TCLP for lead, taken from 8 locations at varying depths/locations of the residual ash pile. Perform proper handling, labeling and shipping of residual material IAW applicable Federal, State, or local law or regulation.  These production facilities previously manufactured processed propellant, or were support facilities for propellant manufacture.  Due to the probability of worker injury from residual contaminant ignition, equipment removal efforts cannot be performed with acceptable risks to worker health.  The real and personal property shall be decontaminated in place, have the scrap metal removed and the residual materials (ash) will be tested and disposed of off-site.  Additional materials such as PCBs, asbestos and gross lead may be present in the buildings. Coordination with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) will be required to ensure the methods proposed or implemented do not result in damage to human health, or the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations.  The intent of this activity is to decontaminate the buildings and associated equipment identified.  Recommended methods for decontamination have been approved by the Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB).  These recommended methods can only be deviated from if prior approval is authorized from DDESB, such as non-burn methods to achieve an explosive free result.<BR><BR>Pre-Decontamination Requirements:  Prior to the  decontamination process, precursor efforts shall be accomplished. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) shall be adhered to. At a minimum, an Environmental Assessment (EA) will be prepared by the contractor assessing the cumulative impacts of the proposed action (explosive decontamination, testing and off-site disposal of residual materials or scrap metal) and its impacts to human health and the environment.  The draft EA shall be provided to the INAAP COR for review/comment. The contractor will finalize the EA and sign as prepared by of the EA and associated document (Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), if necessary). The Army will publish the EA in local newspapers for a period of 30 days seeking public comment.  The contractor shall review all public comments and prepare a response to each public comment for Army review and will be submitted to the INAAP COR.  Once all public comments are addressed, the EA/FNSI shall be finalized by the contractor and provided to the INAAP COR.  The contractor will obtain an approved Air permit/variance from the IDEM prior to commencement of the decontamination efforts.  This shall include but may not be limited to, conducting meetings with IDEM representatives, preparation of permit application including revisions, provide air modeling data, provide paint sampling work plan, provide previously determined sampling results (air, paint, lead, asbestos, etc.), participate in public meetings with Army and IDEM representatives.  This may also include proposing operating procedures previously approved by DDESB for review/comment by the IDEM or regulators of primacy.  The procedures will detail methods and operations that will be implemented during this project.  The contractor will also propose a timeline for execution, specifically outlining how the series of events are proposed to occur during the project.  These events outlined may include, but are not limited to, environmental regulator, local fire and law enforcement departments and/or public health organization coordination, utility disconnect, paint sampling/analysis, asbestos abatement, disassembly, decontamination, residual material sampling, post decontamination confirmation sampling, scrap metal removal off-site, residual material disposal off-site, site restoration, etc.  Any subcontracted effort shall have the subcontract specifications reviewed and approved by the INAAP COR prior to solicitation.  The contractor will prepare each building or building groups for decontamination.  This may consist of activities such as utility disconnects, site preparation, asbestos removal and off-site disposal (for non-friable or friable types), weather monitoring/forecasting, pre-burn check-list preparation and review, regulatory coordination/notification and other pre-burn activities.  Some of the facilities contain friable and/or non-friable asbestos.  Since the propellants processed in some of the production facilities were in colloided state, there may be an opportunity to safely mitigate the asbestos prior to decontaminating the equipment and buildings.  Other materials, such as asphalt shingles will be removed if the activity can be performed without risk of propellant/explosive inadvertent detonation.  Above all, the explosive risk to worker health must be considered foremost when evaluating whether hazardous/non-hazardous/nuisance materials can be removed before explosive decontamination takes place.<BR><BR>Facility Decontamination:  The buildings identified for thermal decontamination (TD) shall be decontaminated in accordance with DoD Instruction 4140.62 and CENNC-OE-CX Document 06-03 dated 27 Jan 06. The decontaminated condition of residual materials shall be demonstrated by temperature paint or thermocouple installation/monitoring or other more precise analytical testing methods.  Due to worker safety considerations, facilities may be decontaminated with personal property left in place (or other method, subject to approved environmental and safety authorizations).  Procedural authorizations for any environmental waivers will be obtained prior to physical work starting. All demolished concrete blocks, bricks, and debris will be removed and disposed of off site. Creosote wooden blast walls, and poured concrete structures such as; floor slabs, interior walls, sumps, and blast walls will not be demolished, but left in place.  Demolition activities will not adversely impact active work or operations.  Work shall be scheduled so interference with other efforts is minimized.  Adjacent facilities not part of this project shall be protected from damage and debris.  Any airborne debris will be controlled to prevent the spread of dust while avoiding the creation of a nuisance in surrounding areas.  The use of water to spray the site to reduce release of airborne particulate is permitted as required, but shall be controlled to ensure it does not create hazardous or objectionable conditions such as ice, flooding, excess run off, pollution, reaching a waterway or flowing into a sinkhole/karst feature.  The contractor shall not use the decontamination site for burning refuse. The contractor will certify and verify building and equipment debris as free of explosive hazards. A video in Digital Video Disk (DVD) format showing all building burns shall be prepared and provided (5 Copies) as part of this task.<BR><BR>Cleanup: Soil disturbance will be kept to a minimum during pre/post decontamination as well as clean up.  Based on post decontamination testing results of the material/ash residue, proper handling, labeling, collection, shipment and disposal of the material will be conducted in support of off-site disposal IAW applicable Federal, state or local law or regulation. Upon removal/disposal of residual material, confirmation samples shall be tested as identified, to ensure no surface contamination resulted or remains as a direct result of the decontamination activities. In the event soil contamination exists, further delineation shall take place in order to determine the remaining soils that will require excavation and hauling for off-site disposal.  In lieu of further delineation, the contractor may choose to perform a risk assessment to determine the risk to human health and the environment that could preclude the dig/haul activities.  Disposal shall be accomplished at an approved offsite landfill or through an approved scrap dealer.  Hauling and disposal shall be performed IAW interstate statutes.  After sites have been visually inspected and equipment removal work is complete, the site will be graded to match the existing landscape and to allow for natural drainage.  The site will be seeded with grass to avoid erosion using 50-pound pure live seed/acre of fescue.  Material handling of asbestos/ash/scrap will be minimized.  Hot work permits from the RRDA will be required when performing scrap disassembly.<BR><BR>Foundation Testing/Post Burn Confirmation Samples:  The facilities scheduled for thermal decontamination (TD), are also required to have foundations tested for the presence of explosives as a condition of post decontamination.   A Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) will be required to support the foundation testing efforts. Provide a draft SAP to the Army for review/comment.  Revise the SAP and provide a Draft Final to the INAAP COR for submittal to IDEM.  Review/respond to IDEMs comments through the INAAP COR and finalize SAP within 30 days of IDEMs comments.  Intact foundations, slabs and blast walls of the facilities may remain, if structurally sound.  The contractor shall test for propellant presence along appendages, all cracks, floor drains, and footings at any point considered high risk, or at any point where natural or man-made drainage may have deposited residual propellant.  Where explosive testing is performed for adjacent soils (along (below/outward from) slabs), sampling shall be accomplished by use of XRF (lead) with 6010B sampling method (lead only) taken and sent to a certified lab for validation of XRF results, at a depth of zero to six inches below grade and no more than the distance by which the residual ash material laid awaiting final disposition.  Both field-testing (colorimetric Expray or Websters), and laboratory sampling (EPA 8330 method) shall be utilized for explosives.  All test results and analysis shall be provided and summarized in the final report.  The report will identify sample location(s), sample method, results of analysis, personnel collecting the sample, sample time, and sample date.  Electronic photos shall be provided for all positive samples. A drawing depicting the sample locations shall be prepared and highlight those locations that exceed 10% by weight for explosives and lead above IDEM action levels. The contractor shall perform post decontamination sampling for lead (XR  F (lead) and 6010B-lead only, as validation) at the specified locations, including the furthest point of which the ash existed post decontamination: Load Line 2, 9 Buildings, Miscelleanous 200 Series, 6 Buildings, 700 Series, 10 Buildings.<BR><BR>Investigation of Industrial Sewer:  Propellant grains were located in three industrial sewer manholes during an FY08 P&E Sewer Investigation. The contractor will inspect the following locations using exploratory borescope: (1) Approximately 600 LF between IWT165 and Building 219-8 (2) Approximately 625 LF between IWT604 and IWT607.  If investigation confirms no explosive present, those sewers will not be explosively decontaminated. Propellant grains located in manholes described above will be removed and the contractor will certify that the sewers are decontaminated and free of explosive hazards and rendered inoperable.

<DESC><p>The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System Integrator (AOC WSI), Lockheed Martin Corp, Information Systems &amp; Global Services, Colorado Springs, CO, seeks innovative technologies and solutions for advancing capabilities of the 10.2 AOC Weapon System (WS). <br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) is the Joint Force Air Component Commander's (JFACC) primary node for commanding air and space power. The AOC is the weapon system (personnel, capabilities and equipment) through which the JFACC exercises command and control of aerospace forces. It is the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS). The JFACC employs the AOC Weapon System (AOC WS) to maneuver and mass overwhelming air and space power through centralized control and decentralized execution to produce desired operational and strategic effects in support of the Joint Force Commander's (JFC) campaign. The AOC is the air and space operations planning, execution, and assessment system for the JFACC. The AOC develops the air and space operations strategy and planning documents to meet JFACC objectives and guidance. The AOC tasks and executes day-to-day air and space operations and provides rapid reaction, positive control, coordination, and de-confliction of weapons systems.<br /><strong>Synopsis/Description<br /></strong>The AOC WS future baseline (10.2) is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that features flexibility, interoperability, and efficiency. The Net-Readiness Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP) is a vital to obtaining our architectural goals. Lockheed Martin is hosting a two-day AOC WS 10.2 Industry Forum conference and trade show at the Hampton Roads Convention Center in Hampton, VA July 21 - 23. Contractor Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf ( GOTS) vendors with cutting edge technologies and creative solutions are invited to attend. The Industry Forum is intended to collect the best solutions from a broad industry audience. The forum provides multiple venues for interaction with the AOC WS program team.<br /><strong>Conference Agenda<br /></strong>&bull; AOC WS Overview - Mission and vision<br />&bull; AOC WSI Overview - Our life cycle<br />&bull; 10.2 Architecture<br />&bull; Interfaces and Interoperability<br />&bull; Mission Capability Needs<br />&bull; Infrastructure Capability Needs<br />&bull; AOC WS Integration Guidelines and Standards<br /><strong>Vendor Demonstrations and Exhibits<br /></strong>In addition to the conference the AOC WS is providing an exhibit hall for industry to host a booth in Trade Show format. At the trade show vendors can demonstrate and present their solutions.<br /><strong>One-on-Ones<br /></strong>Lockheed Martin will hold a limited number of one-on-one sessions on Thursday July 23rd.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Joint Communication Support Element (JCSE) requires two C-130 Hatch Continuous-On-The-Move (COTM) Inertial Reference Unit's (IRU). The IRU provides antenna pointing data to the Ku-Spread Spectrum Terminal. This enables the antenna to track the satellite while the aircraft is in flight along with providing the capability to operate the terminal on the ground. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to ViaSat, 6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad CA 92009.. Interested parties may e-mail Donald Mills at donald.mills@macdill.af.mil or telephone 813-828-1870, not later than 27 May 09; 10:00 a.m. EST.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY): In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A), this enhancement is considered a follow on contract for the continued development of a major system. Use of any vendor other than ViaSat would require duplication of the IRU system, which would result in substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competitive bidding. The IRU's are manufactured by General Electric, however the mounting bracket is proprietary to ViaSat and are crucial to getting this application to work on a C-130.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE CONTRACTORS UNDER EXISTING ARCHITECT/ENGINEERING IDIQ CONTRACT NOS. 08CA10677C and 08CA10677D. The Request for Task Order Proposal package will be sent to the designated IDIQ contractors and will be competed using FAR 36.6 procedures. This notice is not a pre-solicitation notice for offers.  The purpose of this Task Order is the development and evaluation of alternatives to provide improvements to anadromous fish habitat and stream health in the Entiat River between river miles 23.1 and 21.0.  This reach of the Entiat River has been evaluated through a science-based approach developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) Pacific Northwest Region, which has resulted in a "reach assessment," identified as the "Preston Reach."   This task order will result in an Alternatives Evaluation Report (AER) for projects within the Preston Reach of the Entiat River. The work will include site investigation, data collection, development of appraisal-level options, presentation of technical results, refinement of any preferred alternatives, and an AER. A subsequent design task order will be requested at the end of this task order for development of final designs and specifications for construction of a selected alternative.  Following that another phase is possible which would include design support during construction and construction observation. The project is located in the Entiat Sub-basin on the Entiat River approximately 22 river miles upstream of the confluence with the Columbia River.

<DESC>This modification will ensure that Willapa Bay Regional Fishery Enhancement Group, a non-profit organization will effectively manage an increased level of research processing.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service awarded this Order on July 24, 2008.  The NAICS code for this action is 541620.
The modification will add work summarized as follows:  The Government requires another 2 seasons of data collection to strengthen the findings made to date on the contract and thereby provide more information to assist in the management of endangered lamprey to ensure the Government's uninterrupted goals to establish self-sustaining populations of western brook lamprey in several streams within the Willapa National Wildlife Refuge and its surrounding area, Pacific County, Washington.   
The objectives are to compile and review scientific literature regarding the ecology and management of western brook lamprey; identify streams within the Refuge that offer the highest potential for successful lamprey reintroduction; initiate a monitoring program that would track the long term success of reintroduction efforts; and collaborate with partner groups, landowners, volunteers and other parties with a vested interest in lamprey conservation. 
The current contractor has the expertise and knowledge of how such previous collected information has been obtained in order to properly integrate it with this planned work.  Contracting with another contractor at this point in the project would create undue hardship to the Government by requiring Government personnel to integrate information that it has virtually no role in collecting.  Use of any other offeror would result in substantial duplication of costs and time delays to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  The estimated dollar value for the additional work is estimated to be approximately $25,000
Any information regarding this action can be obtained by contacting Linda Askew, Contracting officer, at linda_askew@fws.gov, 503-736-4498 prior to 4 PM PST on June 9, 2009.

<DESC>1.	Identifications
a.	Agency:		National Park Serviceb.	Contracting Office:	Glacier National Park
2.	Description of the action being approved:The National Park Service (NPS) shall be soliciting for an access control system as part of the rehabilitation of the West Entrance Station Solicitation.  The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer.  This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
3.	Description of supplies and services:
Products 	Estimated total cost for materials Tyco Access Control Controller        	$3,000Tyco Access Control Card Readers	$2,400  4.	Authority:	a.	41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.b.	FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs.c.	FAR 6.302-1: The use of the name brand products are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
5.	The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:Glacier National Park's current systems utilize a specialized, proprietary hardware/software system manufactured by Tyco. Other brands of security systems use their own proprietary protocols that do not interface with the Tyco system.
6.	Efforts to obtain competition:a.	Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:For acquisitions over $25,000 the solicitation will be issued on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov. b.	Presolicitation notice per FAR 5.2:For acquisitions over $25,000 a presolicitation notice shall be posted on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov unless the exception noted at FAR Part 5.202(a)(13) applies.
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable:The Government shall compete the prime contract and price shall be a major evaluation factor. So as to offer the lowest price, prime offerors will compete subcontracts based upon price. Thus, subcontractors will seek to obtain competitive pricing, from their suppliers. Suppliers will in-turn seek to provide competitive pricing for the products they provide and obtain competitive pricing from the product manufacturer.  Different manufacturers typically compete to sell their products to the different suppliers and thus the manufacturers strive to provide competitive pricing to the suppliers.
8.	Description of the market research conducted:Approximately three years ago the Park conducted extensive research into the various security systems available.  A contract was competitively bid to install an access control system in the Headquarters Administration building.  This system and its associated server are the "heart" of the access control system for the entire park.  The access control systems in all other facilities must interface with this system.  The Tyco system was selected because it provided the most cost effective solution to our needs.
9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition:
a.	Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed:Refer to item 5 above.
b.	Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government:Glacier's existing access control system controls numerous structures with hundreds of access points. If a different system other that the one described above were to be used, a complete parallel monitoring system would need to be installed in the Park's Communication Center.  This would require additional personnel to monitor that system in addition the existing system.  This would place the additional burden on the Government to hire and train additional personnel to operate, troubleshoot and monitor the different system.
10.	Interested Sources:None to our knowledge.
11.	Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:In the future when the current system becomes obsolete the Park will conduct competition to choose a new system.

5.	The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:a.	Due to budget constraints the park cannot afford to train its technicians on the proper procedures for repairing each and every manufacturer of door lock cores. Thus, the Park's technicians have been trained to repair the lock cores for a single manufacturer, Best.b.	Due to budget constraints the Park cannot afford to stock spare parts for all manufacturers of lock cores. Thus, the park currently stocks parts for only one manufacturer, Best.c.	The park's use of a Best master keying system allows emergency personnel to carry fewer master keys and still gain access to all park facilities.  This results in faster entry to buildings during an emergency.d.	Refer to item 9 below for additional information.
6.	Efforts to obtain competition:a.	Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:We currently anticipate soliciting for general construction services using the "best value" approach.  We anticipate the potential prime contractors will compete their subcontracts, one of which will be for the supply and installation of the door locks and cores.b.	Presolicitation notice per FAR 5.2:Per Federal Acquisition Regulations a presolicitation notice will be issued.
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable:We currently anticipate soliciting for general construction services using the "best value" approach.

Different manufacturers typically compete to sell their products to the different suppliers and thus the manufacturers strive to provide competitive pricing to the suppliers.
8.	Description of the market research conducted:The systems of other manufactures cannot be modified to be compatible with the Best keying system.  The maintenance of the systems would also be prohibitively expensive as noted in item 5 above. In addition the government could be harmed as noted in item 9 below.  9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition:a.	Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed:Refer to item 5 above.
b.	Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government if other brand name products are utilized:1)	The amount of time to repair malfunctioning equipment would be increased because:a)	The Park's locksmiths would not be familiar with the equipment from all the different manufactures,b)	The Park could not maintain a supply of repair parts for all the different manufactures and thus there would be delays in obtaining repair parts. 2)	The amount of time to key locksets would be increased because:a)	The Park's locksmith would have to research the process for keying the different manufacture systems, b)	The Park could not afford to maintain a supply of the necessary parts and thus the parts would have to be order and shipped.3)	Better security can be provided if a single locking system is utilized for all Park facilities. 4)	Emergency personnel will be able to gain access to facilities quicker because they will only have to carry a few master keys.
10.	Interested Sources:None to our knowledge.
11.	Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:In the future when the current system becomes obsolete the Park will conduct competition to choose a new system.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition, intends to award a sole source award to  Colt Defense LLC, 547 New Park Ave, West Hartford, CT, 06110-1336 for M4A1 rile parts.  DS Special Agents will be required to utilize the M4A1 rifles while in Iraq and other high threat post.  Colt Defense LLC is the manufacturer and sole distributor of the certified Colt M4 and parts.  

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  It is recommended that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of 150 COLT M4A1 rifles.   The estimated cost will be $58,535.00.   2.   It is required that the COLT M4A1 rifles be purchased to support the Agents assigned to critical missions.  This will enable DEAV to furnish Agents with the weapons they need to provide continued protection for personnel overseas.  Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while travelling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability.  
3.  The COLT  M4A1 rifles with detachable handles is the weapon that all agents are issued once they go through BSAC.  The M4A1 Carbine has been approved by the FPRB for issuance to all State Department personnel and contractors.  The Colt M4 is utilized all over the world as Diplomatic Security missions dictate, an unreliable, after-market magazine of dubious quality and functionality cannot be used.    4.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  5. Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the magazines and weapons requested, The Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the support that is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The COLT M4A1 rifles with detachable handles and magazines described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation.   6.  The magazine and weapon that has been requested are the same magazines and weapons that are issued to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons and magazines to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  7.  The M4 Carbine and magazine described above are to be utilized by Special Agents assigned to missions and posts overseas.  It is imperative that the agents receive the same equipment on this assignment that they are trained on, so when faced with an unsettled condition they are able to provide the protective services required.  DS has verified that the request as described represents the governments minimum requirements.
8.   Without the COLT weapon repair parts and tools requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the equipment they are trained on which is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The weapon repair parts and tools described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation.  The weapons have been requested for the agents who were trained on the use of the M4 and the M203, and are given to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The weapons and magazines requested are needed to equip the agents on what they will be expected to use once they arrive in Baghdad, Iraq.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents and DEAV armorers in the field including purchasing all new weapons to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.

Monitoring/Evaluation
The Department of State will enhance its disciplined Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process by increasing the level of scrutiny and frequency.  These processes include project life-cycle methodology with rigorous earned value management, which will show us the bang for the buck as the project proceeds.  Progress reports that include earned value data will be distributed monthly.  Project Managers are/will be certified by the Project Management Institute and trained in the Department of States standard project management methodology.

This effort will use a set of formal, established measures to ensure it achieves the desired outcome(s) and executes appropriately.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award non-competitively a sole-source purchase order to Conservation Canines, Center for Conservation Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, to perform scent surveys for a sampling study of the acific Pocket Mouse (PPM) on/near Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA.  Two handlers with dogs trained to differentiate PPM scat from that of other roidents will survey all PPM habitat for two weeks in June or early July.  The goal is to walk transects spaced approximately 20m apart (assuming 10m detection range in either direction) over all or most of defined PPM habitat.  Dogs will act as double observers, separately walking the transects to pick up the scent of PPM scat.  Pin flags and tracking tubes will be placed at locations where the dogs record a positive scent detection.  The goal of this program is to track trends of the critically endangered PPM populations over a fairly large spatial area on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.
Conservation Canines is uniquely qualified to conduct canine scent surveys for a sampling study of the Pacific Pocket Mouse (PPM).  PPM are the smallest animals to ever be tested using these methodologies.  The Center for Conservation Biology at the University od Washington, developed the scat detection dog program in 1997.  Having pioneered the development and application of many of the fecal-based hormone and genetic techniques widely used today, Conservation Canines realized the need for a sampling method that would insrease sample acquisition over large remote areas, while reducing bias associated with unequal capture probabilities common with other sampling techniques.
This is not a solicitation for proposals for the subject effort.  Should you believe your firm is qualified to perform the effort outlined above, please contact Dick Paprocki, Contract Specialist, at rpaprocki@usgs.gov, giving your firm's qualifications, no later than June 5, 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The contractor will:  De-water, clean, inspect, repair, and paint spillway gates at Coffeeville, Holt, and Bankhead Dams.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Applied Biosystems, Inc. TaqMan 1000 RXN Gold with Buffer A Packs are critical to achieve the accuracy and stability of results in the performance of NBFACs RealTime PCR assays.  The AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase included within the pack is chemically modified to be activated when the reaction reaches an optimal annealing temperature; this reduces the extension of misprimed primers in PCR reactions.  The reagent also includes a passive reference I that normalizes signal in all TaqMan Assay reactions and corrects inter-well signal variation caused by slight differences in reaction volume.  These are critical attributes that no other vendor of RealTime PCR reagents is able to provide.  The GeneAmp dNTPs with dUTP kits are of the highest quality and purity of the RealTime PCR reagents currently found on the market.  The reagents include a Certificate of Analysis from Applied Biosystems that certifies the products purity is 91%. This is a critical attribute for this product in the performance of high quality RealTime PCR assays.<BR>No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the supplies is invited to submit a written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication of this notice.

<DESC>SynopsisTHIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Bay Pines, Florida intends to solicit and negotiate with Saint Anthony's Hospital, Inc. the procurement of 20 outdoor parking spaces located on property at 1200 7th Avenue North, St. Petersburg, Florida.This property is adjacent to 840 Dr. MLK Jr. Street North, St. Petersburg, Florida where the new South St. Petersburg community based outpatient clinic (SSP CBOC) will be located.The new CBOC location will include community-based providers that utilize GSA vehicles during normal business hours. Due to high demand for parking spaces, additional spaces will be needed for employee parking so that patients can park closer to the building. To the best of our knowledge, Saint Anthony's Hospital parking spaces are the only ones within reasonable distance of proposed CBOC location and are therefore unique in capabilities.The proposed contract action is for lease space for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Supporting documentation must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate comparability to Saint Anthony's Hospital Inc. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received by 2:00 p.m. EST, June12, 2009 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. Interested parties may e-mail, michael.james6@va.gov.Contracting Office Address:Bay Pines VAHCS4300 Duhme RoadMadeira Beach, Florida 33708Point of Contact:Dr. Michael Elisha JamesContract Specialist (727) 399-3335

Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: FAR 6.302-5.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
XUMUOS278409 - MGT, SPECIES, EL SEGUNDO BLUE BUTTERFLY
SOW for Entomological Specialist
AT
VANDENBERG AFB, CA

Project Description
Contractor will provide specialized entomological support to 30 CES/CEVNN staff. The following activities are expected from the contractor; assistance in designing survey protocol to maximize the effectiveness of brief flight periods, ground truthing previous remote sensing models predicting where butterflies are anticipated, assistance with estimating population of endangered butterflies and their habitat on base, providing entomological training to Vandenberg biologists and providing input, as needed, in other regulatory requirements which require species specialized, independent, scientific recommendations.

The contractor must be an experienced entomologist, familiar with habitat nuances that are present in the Euphilotes battoides complex (group of butterflies).  This experience and knowledge will allow the contractor to know what anomalies to look for when providing recommendations to VAFB staff. Contractor must have extensive and published experience in restoration efforts for butterflies in the Euphilotes battoides complex.  Contractor will provide assistance to 30 CES/CEVNN in locating potential sites for restoration, suggested removal methods, seed collection and other general support for future habitat restoration activities.

This contractor will provide 120 hours of support, to include at least 80 hours of flight season surveying. 30 CES/CEVNN will coordinate with contractor when the buckwheat plants bloom to ensure contractor arrives at the correct time. It is anticipated that the contractor will make 3-4 trips each lasting 2-3 days during the flight season. Travel on the installation will also be expected, as the butterfly populations are widely distributed on the installation and are often remote.


Justification
	Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543), the Air Force is required to manage for threatened and endangered species while supporting the Air Force mission.
	IAW ESOHCAMP NR.20.1.US, Verify that a survey has been done to determine if there are any threatened or endangered species if conditions are present that such a species could be present.
	Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a670f).and AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management. Military departments are required to coordinate with federal and state agencies in the planning and management of natural resources on military installations.  
	EO 11312, Invasive Species Management
	National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)


Tasking

Plan of Action:  
1.	PhD-level entomologist must be willing to train individuals and write a letter of reference to USFWS attesting to their professional skills.
2.	Contractor will survey and collect appropriate data under appropriate weather conditions.  If surveying requires other sensitive biological areas (such as western snowy plover and California least tern nesting areas) entomologist must be escorted by permitted biologists.
3.	All areas occupied by the ESBB and areas surveyed will be mapped, and GIS shapefiles will be submitted to CEVNN upon completion of the surveys. Data collected should be accurate to within less than 3 meters.
4.	Surveyors must be willing to add qualified individuals to their permits as supervised individuals while surveying on Vandenberg.  Supervised individuals may help surveyors record location data (GPS), however, it is ultimately the permit holders responsibility to record all data and in the event of a supervised individual not being available for a survey, the Permit Holder will ensure this is accomplished. 
5.	A final report will detail the all work pertaining to the El Segundo blue butterfly, performed under this contract will be submitted to VAFB biologists at the end of the project. Contractor will complete and submit California Natural Diversity Database forms for all positive sightings.

Attachment A
Strategies for developing standard contract
deliverable language for GeoBase programs



Three options (or any combination thereof):

1.	Address by reference to organizations responsible for policy and guidance:

	 as described under current policy and guidance established by the AF/ILE and AF-CIO,
	 as described under current policy and guidance by the 38EIG, etc.

2.	Address by reference to existing policy and guidance documents:

	 as described in the current USAF Garrison Mapping CONOPS..
	 as required under current guidance, including the USAF Enterprise GeoBase Architecture and the USAF GeoBase Imagery Data Architecture .

3.	Address explicitly and specifically under current guidance and policy:

If this option is exercised, suggest developing measurable performance metrics for each contract deliverable (i.e. each map layer or entity as defined in the SDSFIE) in the following areas:

3.1	Completeness
For each map layer, will this effort map all of the base or just a portion?  Will this effort include any or all GSUs?

3.2	Currency
What is the acceptable temporal delay before changed conditions are delivered to the Geo Integration Office and are represented by the GeoBase service?

3.3	Accuracy
Accuracy should be measured in two dimensions, positional accuracy and attribute accuracy  

3.3.1  Positional Accuracy  Vector Data:  Section 5.1.5.2 Spatial Accuracy, USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, reads:

 CIP and MDS vector data (points, lines, polygons) should be mapped at 1:1200 (1=100) scale or better for base cantonment areas and 1:4800 (1=400) scale or better for undeveloped (natural) base areas.

CIP and MDS data should meet accuracy standards set forth in the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Accuracy Standards for Large Scale Maps and the FGDC National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) at those map scales. NSSDA accuracy standards and accuracy quantification methodologies are provided in FGDC STD 007.4-2002 and FGDC STD 007.3-1998, respectively.

The National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) (U.S. Bureau of the Budget, 1947) may be used to assess spatial accuracy at map scales smaller than 1:20,000 and are superseded by the ASPRS and FGDC NSSDA accuracy standards at map scales identified above.

The use of threshold values should be used to set quantitative standards tied to the NSSDA, and ASPRS standards respectively.  Project costs and functional accuracy requirements should be carefully considered to establish appropriate thresholds for each map layer.  Contract deliverables should be measured by both the contractor and the government organization to meet these thresholds to ensure data quality, as contracted.

Vertical Accuracy  for any product that models elevation (i.e. contours, DEM, LIDAR, extruded building heights, etc.).
 
3.3.1  Positional Accuracy  Imagery:  

3.3.2	Attribute Accuracy  

Section 5.1.1.1 Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure, and the Environment, USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, second sentence reads, A standard interpretation of the SDSFIE will be established during the transitional architecture phase.  Installations should adopt this standard data model once it is available.  Until this standard is available, organizations should at a minimum follow the following fundamental standards and practices:

Attribute table structure  
	Section 5.1.1.1 Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure, and the Environment, USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, first sentence, reads: Installation geospatial data should be organized using SDSFIE, Version 2.2 or greater. 
	Attribute fields shall not be deleted after created from the CADD-GIS Technology Centers database generator tool, nor shall specifications for attribute fields be modified after they have been created.

Attribute table field population - Section 3.5.1 Attribute Storage Location, USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, reads, Columns in the SDSFIE tables should store the following: 
 Primary and foreign keys facilitating relational join to AIS database tables; 
 Any descriptive information for which there is no existing column in an AIS database table; 
 Generic attributes that may be of value to numerous functional communities (such as building number and street name).

Attribute table field values  SDSFIE domain values should be used.   If exceptions are needed, organizations should work with their units GIO to identify the technical requirement for a revision to the SDSFIE and forward this suggestion and requests for exceptions to the current release in use through their MAJCOM to the HAF GIO (for the CIP) or respective FOA (MDSs).

Attribute value accuracy  
Measured by sampling and verification.  Several standard statistical methods may be employed.

3.4  Documentation - 
Section 5.1.5.3 Metadata (CSDGM), USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, second paragraph, reads:

USAF installations shall capture all metadata elements classified as mandatory and mandatory-if-applicable. These elements can be found in the FGDC CSDGM Metadata Workbook, which can be downloaded at http://www.fgdc.gov/publications/documents/metadata/workbook_0501_bmk.pdf. A brief visual summary of mandatory metadata is included in Appendix D.

The HAF GIO has not as yet published specific suggestions for metadata values for the Common Installation Picture (CIP).  FOAs may also be developing guidelines with standard and/or suggested metadata values for Mission Data Sets (MDSs).  Until such standards are established, organizations may wish to model a metadata value content standard that meets their needs.  Appendix B of the DoD Installation Visualization Tool Quality Assurance Plan (IVT QAP) is an example of such a standard.

3.5  File Format
What is the system architecture precedent or plan at your base or MAJCOM?  For ESRI architectures, suggest first personal Geodatabases, then shapefiles.  Projection parameters and XML metadata should be stored natively within the personal Geodatabase .mdb file.  If shapefiles are to be delivered, be clear about the need for all three subfile types (.shp, .shx, .dxf) as well as projection parameters presented as a .prj file and an .xml file for metadata all with the same name and in the same directory when delivered.

3.6  Geospatial Data Registration
Section 5.1.5.1 Geospatial Data Registration, USAF GeoBase Enterprise Architecture v.1.0, first paragraph, reads:

The CIP and MDS should be stored in the Universal Transverse Mercator 1983 (UTM83) coordinate system, Transverse Mercator projection, Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) spheroid, World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum, and use metric coordinate units.

3.7	Geometric representation and logical consistency
Geometric representation varies according to the feature being represented.  The most common need is for area polygons to close.  The cleanliness of editing can also be an issue, if overshoots and undershoots remain.  Remember to clarify the need for continuity on linear features when needed for geometric networks, and principles of intersection, adjacency (contiguous features), nesting, and allowance for overlapping features (when appropriate) and whether multipart topology for point, line, and area represented features is appropriate for the information you are trying to represent.  Logical consistency must be considered particularly where flow is an issue in a linear network (i.e. sanitary and storm sewers running downhill).

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Information from FAR clause 52.232-25, Prompt Payment (FEB 2002), Paragraph (a)(5)(i):  For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision.  If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance.  The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter.

The questions posed were as follows:

It would be helpful to have more information on this system being requested:  Size of substrate, how much tilt, are the power supplies DC or RF and what size power supplies? 

Will you be sputtering metals or organics? Do you need two sputtering power supplies for co sputtering or will one do with the ability to run either gun?

The answers provided by the technical contact are as follows:

1. Size of substrate: the rotary stage platform should be able to accommodate a typical 3 x 1 microscope slide. In certain instances we may wish to coat a 100 mm diameter wafer, however, the critical samples are all quite small (3 mm x 2 mm chips, 2 mm x 20 mm ferrules, etc) and will typically be mounted on something akin to a microscope slide.

2. Tilt: We have no definite requirement. An ability to vary the tilt between 0 and 45 degrees is desirable.

3. Sputtering material: the as delivered system must be set up and have all necessary sources and accessories to sputter a chrome adhesion layer followed by gold without incurring the need to break vacuum between steps in the process.

4. Co sputtering is not a minimum requirement, but may be viewed as advantageous when comparing vendor quotes.

The question regarding whether the power supplies are DC or RF and what size power supplies are included are sub-system components that really arent in our purview to specify in such detail. These should be regarded as component descriptions of the system proposed.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged, including the closing date (June 2, 2009).

<p>PART I INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Campus Challenge problem solving competition is an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Munitions Directorate. The purpose of the competition is to solicit innovative, potentially paradigm-shifting ideas that have the potential, upon maturity, to successfully address specific real-world problems of interest to the Air Force research community. This is accomplished through direct competition, ultimately among a small number of participants. Campus Challenge is a recurring event that could feature a different selection of participants each time. But the charter will always be the same-a challenge to match wits in devising solutions to real problems through the advent of new technology.</p>
<p>This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.</p>
<p>PART II RESEARCH PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES FOR MINIATURE SELF-DEPLOYING SYSTEMS (MSDS) IN CLUTTERED/CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS</p>
<p>The Urban/Cluttered environment represents an area that has captured military interest in recent years. Traditional aerospace research has focused on speed, precision, endurance, and stealth. However, the possibility of operating miniature systems in this environment brings about new challenges.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Munitions Directorate would be able to bring to maturation all the technologies necessary to allow the US Air Force to confidently pursue the development of a constellation of multi-agent platforms (operating in the air and/or the ground) that can maneuver autonomously. These constellations should be able to maneuver in the open or inside of structures.<br />These maneuvering systems need to be able to provide diverse capabilities to the war-fighter. They may be called upon for search and rescue tasks. The systems may be used to find and identify hazardous materials. They may be employed to detect and identify electronic devices such as computers, radars, or communication systems.</p>
<p>These miniature systems would presumably have the following characteristics:<br />a. Can be air-delivered to the vicinity of a target.<br />b. Can enter the target area autonomously - either airborne or on the ground<br />c. Can operate without recourse to Global Positioning System (GPS) assistance<br />d. Can accommodate a variety of payloads - sensors and/or target neutralization devices<br />e. Possess or have access to enough power to successfully execute the mission<br />f. Can communicate with each other or to a remote monitoring station<br />g. Can be self-disabling and tamper-proof at the mission's conclusion</p>
<p>Size is a consideration. It is desired that these systems be as small as possible while still being able to have the attributes stated above. It is not a necessity that these systems be re-useable after their given mission is complete. But that re-use capability would be advantageous. Therefore, system cost must also be a consideration.</p>
<p>The thrust of this problem statement is to provide the following:<br />1. Identify the key technologies that need to be developed to satisfy each of those seven characteristics. Some of the technologies may already be available.<br />2. Identify the current maturity level of each of those technologies.<br />3. Ultimately, provide a comprehensive technology investment roadmap in which the Munitions Directorate may choose to invest. This investment roadmap would be the most efficient path to follow to bring the required technologies to the requisite maturity level for sub-system integration and demonstration. Time to develop and cost to develop are both factors.</p>
<p>This statement of the problem is intentionally vague so the Munitions Directorate can solicit "out-of-the-box" thinking rather than rehashing already-established concepts. With that understanding, please think in terms of satisfying the envisioned missions of these systems as opposed to any specific characteristic that might not be germane to a truly novel approach.</p>
<p>PART III CAMPUS CHALLENGE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>This competition is divided into four phases: Letters of Intent, White Papers, Proposal Submissions and Campus Challenge Winner Selection.</p>
<p>Phase I -- Letters of Intent: <br />All students (undergraduate or graduate) and faculty of universities are eligible and encouraged to participate. The goal is to produce the best possible solution to the stated problem regardless of who participates. Participation from various universities and departments within the university is encouraged. The universities may team with industry partners, however, the university must take the lead. Only one letter of intent per university team should be submitted.</p>
<p>The letter must be received by 4:00pm CST&nbsp;30&nbsp;June 2009.</p>
<p>The letter shall include a synopsis of the proposed idea. All teams intending to participate must submit a one-page, single spaced letter of intent to AFRL/RWK (see the address in Part V below). The letters will be reviewed by the RW Campus Challenge Review Panel, and approximately ten teams will be selected to submit a follow-up white paper.</p>
<p>The criteria for this initial down select will be technological innovation and likelihood of successful system-level development within a nominal 8- to 12-year timeframe, as evaluated by Campus Challenge Review Panel. The selected participants will be informed and invited to attend a meeting to be held at or near Eglin AFB, FL to discuss the problem and the competition requirements in greater detail prior to their submission of white papers. Those not selected will be notified.</p>
<p>Phase II -- White Paper: <br />In Phase II the participants will be selected to submit a white paper. The anticipated date selecting the white paper participants is 31 May 09. The white paper is the most important factor in the Phase II competition. It should be specific and complete. All of the technical factors do not need to be addressed in the white paper, but the following should be included and emphasized accordingly in the white paper:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Problem requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Describe the proposed technical approaches to comply with the requirements specified in the Problem.</p>
<p>(3) Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to solve the Problem. All technologies or suggested approaches should be available for advanced or system-level development by the Air Force within the next 8- to 12-years after completion of this effort.</p>
<p>Preparation of White Paper: <br />The anticipated date for submission of white papers to AFRL/RWK is 15 Jan 2010. The white paper shall be limited to 10 pages or less, including title page, narrative, tables, figures, and references. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Print size is no smaller than 10-point type in Arial or Times New Roman. All white papers must be submitted in hard copy and electronic media (CD-ROM or e-mail) in MS Word or Portable Document File (PDF) format directly to addresses listed in Part V. On the cover page, reference the BAA number and you CAGE and DUNS codes. To do business with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 2007. Ten paper copies of the white paper shall be submitted; each must bear the signatures, names and departments of those persons who actively participated. No Air Force funding is available for preparation of the white papers or follow-on proposals.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of White Papers: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will be composed of Air Force scientists and technical experts. This team may call upon other government resources for analysis, evaluation, modeling, or costing expertise. Two white papers will be selected as Phase II winners and requests for proposals will be sent to these winners. Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase III -- Proposal Submission: <br />In Phase III, two participants will be selected to submit a proposal. The anticipated date for the Government's Request For Proposals (RFP) is 15 Mar 2010; proposals will be due 15 May 2010. The winners will be asked to submit proposals for a Development Plan describing how the Air Force could most efficiently develop the ideas presented in their respective white papers. Two awards are anticipated to be issued with the estimated amount for each award to be not less than $150,000. However, the government reserves the right to decline award and either proceed with fewer projects or request a proposal from among the original white paper submittals.</p>
<p>Preparation of Proposal: <br />Proposal Preparation instructions are defined in PART V of this BAA.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of Proposal: <br />Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase IV - Campus Challenge Winner Selection<br />Approximately eight months after the contract is awarded, each participant shall deliver a well-structured development plan. These development plans shall, as a minimum, consist of a technology investment roadmap, a development and transition schedule, and a detailed cost estimate. Their purpose shall be to provide the Air Force with a comprehensive strategy whereby the least amount of Government dollars can be best invested to provide all of the technologies necessary to realize the Problem solution within a nominal 8- to 12-year development period. Emphasis shall be placed on developing technologies with a high likelihood of successful transition to Air Force systems at the end of this period. Hence, an investment roadmap that merely recommends extended research grants would be unacceptable. The development plans shall include specific suggestions as to domestic technology vendors. Emphasis should be placed in two areas. The first is the innovative application of emerging technologies to solve the Problem. The second area of emphasis should be placed on describing a transition strategy that moves a technology from laboratory experiment to a viable system. The system should be at a level of maturity so that the Air Force can begin to integrate them into actual sub-system or prototype demonstrations at the end of the 8- to 12- year period, if not sooner. The Air Force reserves the right to accept, reject, or modify some or all of the recommendations presented in either or both development plans and is under no obligation to fund the implementation of the development plan. The Air Force will ultimately evaluate each of these two development plans and determine an overall Phase IV Campus Challenge winner. The overall winner will be notified, and will be presented the "Okaloosa Sword."</p>
<p>Basis for Determining the Campus Challenge Winner: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will determine the Challenge winner by evaluating the Phase IV development plans using the following factors in descending order of importance: feasibility, technology maturity, transition strategy, and Air Force investment cost (these evaluation criteria are similar to the criteria used for proposal evaluation). Feasibility is the Air Force assessment of the probability that the proposed solution will be successful. Technology maturity is the Air Force assessment of the degree of investment risk associated with a particular technology. Transition strategy is the step-by-step process that will logically mature a technology to the point that it becomes a viable component within a larger system. Investment cost is the total Air Force funding on a year-to-year basis that would be required to provide the requisite mature technology and to transition it to the point that it could be successfully demonstrated at the integrated system level. All proprietary technology or data, whether in a white paper, proposal, or development plan, should be clearly labeled. The winning development plan will be the one that clearly and simply provides the more credible, preferably less expensive, means to arrive at an effective solution to the problem for one or more munitions applications. It should be noted that tangible, proof-of-concept demonstrations that serve to verify a competitor's overall concept are encouraged. These successful technology demonstrations would enhance the Air Force's confidence in the feasibility of a given approach.</p>

Pg 23, FAR Clause 52.204-11The projects will be looked at by varies people and will tracked because they are using this money. 2. 80% of the money needs to be spent by October 2010. 3. Look at Page 31 buy American Act, Products from outside the US will need to be approved by the C.O. before they can be used. 4. Contractors will need to provide detail estimates for all Divisions (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, General Trades, Fire Protection, etc.), if the VA can't understand how they got their number than the offer/proposal will be thrown out. 5. Look at the phasing, and provide a commentary, Phasing will be important for this project. 6. Offers will be due June 30, 2009, project will be awarded approx. July or August 2009, Construction Start Approx. Oct., Nov 2009. 7. The VA only pays for installed materials and after the VA has reviewed the installation. 8. Contractor will be expected to submit an Infection control plan based on VA standards, and this will need to be in detail. Due to the area of work and area's surrounding this project areaInfection control will be high priority. The contractor will have to access Central Sterile below this Area. 9. No Office Trailer or storage trailer is to be located on Hospital Grounds property. The site is tight and with other construction projects going on there is no space for additional vehicles.Contractors should propose the use of a shuttle to bring workers from remote site to hospital. Only one vehicle will be allowed to park on site, all other vehicles are asked to park at the far end of the over flow area or off site. 10. The new door to be cut in at stairwell 6 room 1223 between column line 18 & 19 along O, should be done as one of the first steps in the project. This will allow another emergency egress for the waiting area during construction.  11. Coordination and ordering of Materials for replacement of the Air Handling unit teardown, and rebuild will need much consideration due to the fact that this unit serves other areas and will require shutdowns of those areas. This will need to be reviewed by VA before the work begins. 12. This project area is adjacent to the MRI and vibration will be a concern, the contractor is expected to coordinate the work requiring vibration or could disrupt the MRI with the VA prior to performance of the work. 13. Non-related Price factors for evaluation can be found page 11, Table 1 of the solicitation.

<DESC><p>Design, Development, &amp; Documentation Services for COGNOS System<br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The Drug Enforcement Administration is seeking information from 8(a) and Small Business firms that are capable of providing design, development, and documentation for new and existing applications built under the COGNOS framework in support of the Office of Information Systems. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541519. The scope of work consists of:Obtain a full system life cycle support for all current and new application development projects and initiatives within the COGNOS framework. Current initiatives include the following areas: Field Management Plan (FMP) which provides a snapshot view of how each Division is performing in support of the Administrator's Vision and executing the DEA Strategic Plan, Quarterly Performance Statistics (QPS) which tracks and reports the performance of specific enforcement activities (i.e. Disruption and Dismantlement of Priority Target Organizations (PTOs) investigations, asset seizures) and efforts (case initiations, OCDETF case initiations, work hour utilization, wire interceptions)), Inspections Scored Performance Evaluation Calculation Tools (INSPECT) which provides an analytical view of agency, division and office statistics weighted according to the priorities of DEA's mission and the Administrator's vision, Centralized Evidence Reporting and Tracking System (CERTS), and Stati! stical Management Analysis and Reporting Tools System (SMARTS). As reporting requirements evolve, the initiatives will be modified to accommodate the reporting needs of Concorde and other SI systems. The support will consist of developing applications using the COGNOS 8 Business Intelligence Suite. As well as developing reporting application constructs with On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and interactive cubes. The development must be completed in COGNOS 8 and Oracle 10g/11g UNIX/Linux/Windows environment. Application components will include Business Intelligence (BI) reports and dashboards in COGNOS 8 Report Studio, Query Studio, Event Studio, and COGNOS Connection as well as cubes in PowerPlay and data models and packages within Framework Manager. Reporting sources will include operational systems, OLAP, and relational databases. Reports may be published in various formats to include e-mail, HTML, PDF, Microsoft Excel, CSV, and XML. The desired support will enable reporting solutions which analyze large, complex data sets with an easy-to-use, drag-and drop user interface, pivoting, and filtering. This effort has an estimated period of performance for two years._________________________________________________________________ This is NOT a notice of solicitation issuance, but rather, a request for information from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirement.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION OF THE USE OF FUNDS AUTHORIZED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA) ON THIS CONTRACT. The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, awarded a contract to TORRES Advanced Enterprise Solutions, LLC on April 1, 2009 for project management services. This contract action is a modification to add Recovery Act funds in the obligated amount of $1,018,066 to the contract.  This is only available to the aforementioned contractor under contract AG-645S-C-09-0011.   ARRA funds will be assigned to the contract under contract line item number 0004.   The projected award date for obligation of ARRA funds to the contract is 05/27/2009.

This project will:

 Support activities to plan, manage, control and govern the execution of the MIDAS program 

 Support the acquisition process with planning, quality assurance, performance measures, cost/budget estimates, and source selection criteria 

 Support capital planning and preparation of the various Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC) documents needed for the yearly submission to the Office of Management and Budget 

 Support the preparation of budgets, cost estimates, risk adjusted costs development, performance work breakdown structure costs development, benefits cost development, and development of an earned value management system

 Support planning, analysis and reporting of enterprise architecture and strategic alignment with other modernization initiatives

 Provide progress reports and earned value management reporting

MIDAS is an initiative to streamline FSA business processes and develop an effective long-term IT system and architecture for FSA farm program delivery. MIDAS will replace FSAs current farm programs information technology structure of nationally distributed systems with a centralized system that modernizes the delivery of farm programs, improves customer service and satisfaction, achieves federal compliance, and supports USDA and FSA strategic plans. The MIDAS PMO effort will define, plan, monitor, control and document processes to ensure FSAs modernization initiative is delivered within defined scope, quality, time, and cost constraints. To reduce risks associated with this effort, an ANSI Standard 748 certified Earned Value Management System will be used to report schedule and cost performance and track, monitor and correct any performance issues. 

This project will establish the MIDAS PMO and allow the governance process to commence. The MIDAS effort allows FSA to begin developing a customer-centric modernization initiative that will ultimately provide USDA customers with faster, more secure, and more accurate program payments. 

The award was made non-competitively as authorized by FAR 6-302-5(b)(4) under the 8(a) Program pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637. A time-and-materials/labor-hour contract was determined to be the only type of contract suitable for this effort. The nature of the work on this contract involves a number of factors that are outside the control of the contractor that could impact the contract performance. Because of this a fixed-price contract would not be suitable for this contract without a significant mark up in price to compensate for risks.

DO NOT SEND INFORMATION ON PROJECTS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE ABOVE WORK.
 
The size of a small business firm includes all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, etc.  Refer to the Code of Federal Regulations 13 CFR 121.103 for information on how the SBA determines affiliation and 13 CFR 121.108 regarding the penalties for misrepresentation of size status.

A Qualified HUBZone SBC receiving a HUBZone contract for general construction must spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its own employees or employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.  This requirement may be met by expending at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its employees or it may subcontract at least 35% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to one or more qualified HUBZone SBCs.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor may not, however, subcontract more than 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel to non-qualified HUBZone SBCs.

PROJECT DETAILS:  The project is located approximately 15 miles northeast of Tucson, AZ on Arizona Forest highway 39, know locally as the Mt  Lemmon Highway.  Project length is 0.06 miles.  Work includes spot repairs at two locations.  

Site MP 9.8 includes constructing a new 60 ft bridge with pre-stressed concrete box beams; asphalt paved ditch and shotcrete waterway; class 6 riprap; 15 and 5 concrete curb; and guardrail replacement.  There is approximately 1700 yd3 of roadway excavation, probably requiring controlled blasting techniques.  The existing MSE wall will need to be repaired or removed as necessary to construct the bridge.  Some of the existing temporary fix of soil nails and shotcrete will need to be removed as well.  

MP 10.5 work includes a 42 culvert removal and replacement with a 42 culvert and concrete inlet; class 5 riprap; 5 concrete curb; remove and reset guardrail; and MSE wall removal and reconstruction as necessary to install new culvert.

The estimated cost is $ 1 to 2 million and we expect construction work to start early September 2009 and finish around February 2010.  There are possible Mexican Spotted owls & Peregrine Falcons nesting within the project limits that will restrict construction activities. 

This is a difficult construction project in a short construction season located in very steep and rocky terrain.   No formal detailed road closures, except for 30 minute delays, will be in effect as all construction activities will require maintaining existing traffic flow.

MALHEUR, UMATILLA, WALLOWA WHITMAN AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FORESTS

This solicitation will result in multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) (also known as a task order contracts), performance based service contracts spanning approximately five (5) years.  The Government intends to make multiple awards to both industry (businesses interested in purchasing biomass) and service contractors.

Over the duration of the contract, individual task orders with actual quantities will be competed.  Only vendors in the initial contract award pool will be allowed to submit a quote on the work offered, but are not required to offer on all orders.  No restrictions have been set regarding the number of vendors in the award pool, however, sufficient awards will be made to provide for adequate competition of task orders.  

The intent of this contract is to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing and/or rearranging the existing fuel loading on selected project areas located on Malheur, Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman and Ochoco National Forests.  All biomass that is removed will be sold to industry.

The resultant contracts will be firm-fixed price task order service contracts with provisions for timber removal.  The solicitation will be available approximately May 26, 2009.

A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled.  It is anticipated this conference will be held on or around     June 8, 2009 and the exact date and time will be designated in the solicitation.

If you have questions about this project please contact Gary Dillavou Contract Specialist at (541) 278-3841.

Solicitation will now be posted on or about June 1, 2009.

This Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming. All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />This Acquisition shall be competed as SDVOSB SET ASIDE. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. A SDVOSB Set Aside solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $30 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico). However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the SDVOSB Set Aside pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $5 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000. The minimum guarantee for the SDVOSB Set Aside contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <br /><br />Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation. The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted). There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPORTUNITY HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS AN 8(a) SOLE SOURCE SET-ASIDE.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (NWP) has a requirement for the installation of a floating island water fowl nesting habitat.  The project entails construction of 1, 3/4 acre floating island in Sheepy Lake, a permanent body of water located within within Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The island shall be anchored near the center of the southern lobe of Sheepy Lake (Figure 1).  Sheepy Lake has an average surface elevation of approximately 4079 feet and is approximately 430 acres in size.  The proposed island shall float on the lake's surface and be made of recycled material consisting of polypropylene (from recycled carpet) and polyester (from recycled drinking bottles).  Layers of the matrix shall be bonded together with foam. The plastic material shall be stabilized with latex for enhanced UV protection. The island shall be covered by a mixture of small gravel/coarse sand and pumice in order to provide suitable nesting habitat for Caspian terns. <BR><BR>Lower Klamath NWR is managed within the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges Complex, approximately 140 miles inland from the west coast of California. Lower Klamath NWR is in northeastern California (Siskiyou County) and southern Oregon (Klamath County).  The 50,092-acre refuge is a varied mix of intensively managed shallow marshes, open water, grassy uplands, and croplands that provide feeding, resting, nesting, and brood-rearing habitat for waterfowl and other water birds. Lower Klamath NWR receives water via a tunnel from sumps within Tule Lake NWR.  Most of the water that is received is used at the wetland units.  Any leftover water would flow into the Klamath Straits drain, which leads to the Klamath River.  Sheepy Lake of Lower Klamath NWR may also receive water as part of the distribution throughout the refuge but also is fed by tributaries Sheepy Creek and Cottonwood Creek. <BR><BR>The USACE intends to award this contract as an 8(a) sole source set aside under the Small Business Act.  The NAICS Code is 237990 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.  The Magnitude of Construction is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.

<DESC><p>1. The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) intends to solicit and award a competitive 8(a) award to a single source through a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) type contract with Time-and-Materials and Cost Reimbursement CLINs for Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Base Operations Support (BOS). The Cost Reimbursement CLIN will be available for other supplies, training and travel requirements. The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis. This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter. USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to: MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center. Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15 30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians. If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined. The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation. These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary. The transition services are: Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations. When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice. At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments. All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the only official means for FGA BOS information dissemination. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a basic and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2016.<br /><br />2. Draft solicitation W91260-09-R-0001 is posted, with attachments, for industry review. Interested offerors are encouraged to provide comments and/or recommendations about the draft solicitation and attachments. All documents are drafts and may not be complete. The CDRLs, DD254, and Government Property Appendices are not included at this time. However, as documents are refined, they will be posted via amendment. Included in the attachments is a draft PWS Question and Answer document. Also, an amendment will be forthcoming with the redacted current contract and contract modifications. Please send comments and/or recommendations by email to both James McLaughlin, Contract Specialist at james.mclaughlin@smdc-cs.army.mil, and Kathleen B. OConnell, Contracting Officer, at kathleen.oconnell@smdc-cs.army.mil not later than 4:30 PM Mountain Daylight Savings Time, on Wednesday, April 15, 2009.

Disregard any Sources Sought, Presolicitation or Draft Solicitation citations on or within this posting.&nbsp; Since the solicitation number was used for the sources sought and presolicitation notice synopses, the only way to post the final solicitation notice was to mod/amend onto the previous synopses. This posting will reattach final Request for Proposal (RFP), final solicitation attachments and final Performance Work Statement (PWS) appendices.

<p>2. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the war fighter.

PWS Chapters 15 through 30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians. If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services as determined necessary. The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in this solicitation. These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary. The transition services are: Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations.</p>
<p>3. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a one year basic period and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 29, 2016.</p>

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 19.10 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $14,500,000.00. The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award. Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount. This project is for the Design and Construction of a Hazardous Material Response Facility consisting of a laboratory, conference and general use space for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency at the Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia. 

The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 3 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.

Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals. Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered being in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important. This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements. The building could be two stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The Design/Build Contractor shall design the new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged. 

Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location. All technical inquiries and questions relating to this solicitation are to be submitted via e-mail to JoAnn Avants at joann.avants@whs.mil and Gregory Lindsey at gregory.lindsey.ctr@whs.mil. Compact disc and hardcopies will not be available. Offerors should check often for changes (Amendments).

<DESC>RECOVERY  This action is funded by the Recovery Act.  On May 22, 2009, the Social Security Administration (SSA) awarded a Delivery Order to Oracle Corporation for $1,255,058 to provide technical support services to assist SSA in processing incorrect Economic Recovery Payments.

In accordance with the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, more than 50 million Title II and XVI beneficiaries will receive a one-time $250 Economic Recovery Payment beginning, May 7, 2009.  The Government estimates that it will make approximately 15,000-20,000 payments incorrectly.  As a result, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will be required to recover these payments using an administrative debt collection process in their financial accounting system.

Contractor support is required to assist SSA with implementing the needed programming changes to the Agency accounting system to recover these payments.  The technical services to be provided by Oracle to accomplish these changes to the accounting system include: creating accounts receivable records, issuing collection letters, identifying collections that are 60 days past due, notifying the U.S. Treasury Cross-Servicing Program of delinquencies, and establishing summary reports for SSA management to monitor performance of the recovery efforts. 

These modifications to the Agency accounting system must be in place by July 1, 2009.  The period of performance for this order is May 19, 2009 through October 27, 2009.  This opportunity was available to Oracle USA, Inc. and Oracles authorized resellers only in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a) (2)  The item is peculiar to one manufacturer (brand name item).  Only Oracle Corporation USA and its resellers are capable of meeting SSAs needs.  This notice is for INFORMATION ONLY; Contractors should not respond.

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />CONTRACT FA2517-04-C-0005
<p>PAFB CUSTODIAL SERVICE</p>
<p>PART I: JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>21 CONS/LGCAB, 580 Goodfellow Street, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1648</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />The requirement is a modification to an existing contract, FA2517-04-C-0005. The action contemplates a firm fixed price contract modification, [Redacted] for one (1) month, for an estimated amount of $204,590.32. The estimated issue date of contract modification is 26 May 2009.<br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>21 CE/CEOE ensures non-personal custodial services are performed at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, in a manner that will maintain a satisfactory facility condition, present a clean, neat and professional appearance. The scope of custodial service covers approximately 1 million square feet of office space and over 100 facilities across PAFB. The service covers critical facilities such as the Child Development Center, Youth Center, HQ AFSPC Building 1 and HQ NORAD-U.S. NORTHCOM Building 2. 21 CE/CEOE is responsible for developing Appendix 1, Task and Frequency for PAFB custodial services. The firm fixed price contract modification will provide all management, supplies, equipment, transportation, and labor necessary to ensure non-personal custodial services are performed at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, in a manner that will maintain a satisfactory facility condition, present a clean, neat and professional appearance. [Redacted]</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Authority for this action is 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency. <br />"(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and<br />(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government."</p>
<p><br /><br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p><br />1. FAR 6.302-2 authority applies because of the unusual and compelling urgency, precludes full and open competition; delay in award of a contract would result in mission failure to the Government.</p>
<p>2. Background: Rocky Mountain Service System is the current contractor that provides custodial services to PAFB. The current contract's, FA2517-04-C-0005 performance period expires on 31 May 2009. The expiration date includes the six (6) month service extension that was initially exercised to ensure the PAFB custodial contract end date would fall in line with CMAFS custodial contract end date plus a one month extension. The contract modification is for the continued custodial service until such time the new solicitation for custodial service, FA2517-07-R-5001, is complete and a new contract is awarded; approximately one (1) month. This contract modification will ensure continued custodial support for all facilities on PAFB.</p>
<p>3. [Redacted]</p>
<p>4. Without the contract modification, to extend the current contract, custodial services will not be accomplished for an extended period of time. RMSS has provided scheduling continuity for all custodial needs for PAFB to include areas that require their personnel to have employee background checks such as the Child Development Center, Youth Center and other designated restricted area badge access such as HQ AFSPC Building 1 and HQ NORAD-U.S. NORTHCOM Building 2. Changing contractors at the end of this contract would potentially cause a lapse in mission to those areas that require employee background checks and restricted area badge access. The contract modification, to extend the current contract period will allow continued custodial service for PAFB.<br /><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE <br />The contracting officer determined that the proposed contract action is exempt from FAR 5.2 under the exception 5.202(a)(2). "This action is made under the conditions described in FAR 6.302-2 and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in FAR 5.203." Every effort was made on the new solicitation to ensure all eligible HUBZone firms were given an opportunity to propose on the new requirement under solicitation FA2517-07-R-5001.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The table below details the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) amounts. The Government Estimate was developed by Mr. Steve Sullivan of 21 CES by using RS Means and the Davis Inc. estimating systems.</p>
<p>Extension period will consist of one (1) month.<br />DESCRIPTION PROPOSED AIR FORCE<br />ICE ACCEPTED<br />CDC, Youth Center [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Fitness Center [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Main Base [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Emergencies [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Bldg 1 [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Bldg 2 [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />Bldg 2025 [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]<br />TOTAL PRICE [Redacted] [Redacted] $204,590.32</p>
<p>The original contract costs were considered fair and reasonable based on adequate competition. Any proposal received will be evaluated using techniques listed in FAR 15.404 and on that basis, a price fair and reasonableness determination will be made. It is anticipated that all costs associated with the contract modification will be fair and reasonable.<br /><br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market Research will not be conducted for this requirement. The urgency of the requirement, and short acquisition lead-time precludes Market Research. Market Research was conducted on the new solicitation for custodial services and is contained in the solicitation file FA2517-07-R-5001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The new solicitation provides for a complete performance work statement (PWS).</p>
<p>X. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The contract modification is for the continued custodial service until such time the new solicitation for custodial service, FA2517-07-R-5001, is complete and a new contract is awarded; approximately one (1) month. The contract modification will ensure continued custodial support for all facilities on PAFB. The Government's intent is to foster competition and has done so on the new solicitation. The planned award date for the new custodial service solicitation is 19 June 2009.</p>
<p><br /><br />PART II COORDINATION AND APPROVAL DOCUMENT</p>
<p>CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 21st Contracting Squadron<br />PROGRAM/PROJECT: 21 Civil Engineering Custodial Services<br />AUTHORITY: FAR 5.202(a)(2); Unusual and Compelling Urgency<br />ESTIMATED CONTRACT COST: $204,590.32<br />TYPE J&amp;A: Individual</p>
