<DESC>Work includes water quality sampling and analysis on the Sequoia National Forest. The forest will be separated into four (4) zones. Zone 1 is the Hume Lake Ranger district located in the northern portion of the forest directly east from Fresno, CA and includes three (3) sites. Zone 2 is the Western Divide Ranger District located in the central portion of the forest directly east from Porterville, CA and includes eight (8) sites. Zone 3 is the Kern Plateau portion of the Kern River Ranger District located in the southern portion of the forest northeast from Bakersfield, CA and includes eight (8) sites. Zone 4 is the Lake Isabella portion of the Kern River Ranger District located in the southern portion of the forest east from Bakersfield, CA and includes eight (8) sites. See zone maps and individual location maps for additional information. There are currently a few sites included above (Boulder Creek Camp, Leavis Flat CG, Beach MDW Station, Cannell Station, Blackrock Trailhead) closed due to insufficient water production or insufficient funding. These sites may be reopened and require sampling when available.
<p>Most of the water systems are classified as transient non-community systems. All systems are to be sampled every month (approximately 30 days apart) for bacteriological analysis, nitrate (as NO3) analysis every year and nitrite (as NO2) analysis every 3 years. Sampling should be performed as early in the month as feasible to allow for repeat sampling or other follow up actions as necessary. Approximate travel times to each water system location, the approximate season of use (days in service), and the dates of the last nitrate and nitrite analysis are listed in the attached Water System Reference Information table. One system (Old Isabella /Auxiliary Dam Area) currently requires quarterly analysis for nitrates due to high levels. All analyses shall be conducted by a state certified lab. Nitrate and Nitrite analysis results shall be submitted electronically to the correct jurisdiction providing regulatory oversight. All drinking water systems with State oversight shall have Annual Drinking Water Reports submitted to their respective State Oversight Office.</p>
<p>All persons taking water samples shall be "trained samplers" in accordance with the CA Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. Bacteriological sampling and analysis shall be in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Division 4, Chapter 15, Article 3 Primary standards - bacteriological standards. Routine monthly water quality samples shall be analyzed for Total Coliform and E.coli using the Present/Absent method (unless otherwise directed by the Forest Service or jurisdiction having authority). In the event of an E.coli positive analysis, the jurisdiction having authority shall be contacted for direction on disinfection/inspection/sampling and any type of additional analysis (Presence/Absence, Most Probable Number, etc).</p>
<p>Chemical sampling and analysis shall be in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Division 4, Chapter 15, Article 4 Primary standards inorganic chemicals.</p>
<p>Water meters, where installed, shall be read once each month when the monthly water sample is taken. Approximate locations of the water meters are shown on the sample siteing plans. This is an Optional Work Item which may be awarded subject to funds availability and pricing but is not guaranteed.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration of the United States Department of Transportation) is charged with the responsibility of reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) conducts research and evaluation projects related to behaviors and attitudes in highway safety issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OBSR is interested in conducting an evaluation of a seat belt/impaired driving demonstration project.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Restraint use and impaired driving contribute to preventable motor vehicle crash fatalities each year. Efforts to increase seat belt use and decrease alcohol-impaired driving over the past two decades have yielded considerable success. However, these behaviors continue to persist and require more innovative approaches to further make progress towards ceasing these risky practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Specifically, we have seen an increase in restraint use over the past two decades. Results of the 2013 National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS) show the national seat belt use rate at 87 percent, statistically unchanged from 86 percent in 2012. While unchanged from the prior year, this is a significant increase from 79 percent in 2003 and 58 percent in 1994.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The 2012 data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) shows a total of 21,667 occupants of passenger vehicles (passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs) died in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Among occupants whose restraint status was known, 52 percent were unrestrained at the time of the fatal crash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Using this data, NHTSA estimates that belts saved 12,174 lives. However, if belt use had been used 100 percent of the time, then an additional estimated 3,031 lives could have been saved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This estimate as well as the documented effectiveness of belts, indicate a large, unnecessary, and costly loss of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in the past 10 years have declined by 23 percent from 13,472 in 2002 to 10,322 in 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, alcohol-impaired-driving fatalities increased by 4.6 percent in 2012, compared to 9,865 in 2011, accounting for 31 percent of overall fatalities (NHTSA, 2013).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority of those crashes involved drivers with a BAC of .15 or higher, nearly double the legal limit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That works out to an average of one fatality every 51 minutes (NHTSA, 2013).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Furthermore, the data indicates a relationship between impaired driving and unrestrained fatalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For instance, in 2012</span> <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">data showed that drivers killed in 5,163 passenger vehicles (including passenger cars and light trucks [vans, SUVs, pickups, and other light trucks]) had a BAC of .08 or higher. Out of those driver fatalities for which restraint use was known, 70 percent were unrestrained. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">A proven countermeasure for increasing seat belt use and reducing impaired driving is enforcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, high- visibility enforcement (HVE) has been shown to successfully change driver behaviors when coupled with a communications plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The success and effectiveness of this approach has contributed to the trends documented above (increased belt use and decreased alcohol-impaired driving). However, additional and alternate approaches need to be explored to continue these trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">One possible approach is to apply law enforcement models shown to impact crime-related behavior and community perception to traffic safety. Specifically, law enforcement models shown to be successful at reducing fear of crime, robberies, and violent crime have yet to be applied to a highway safety project. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Purpose:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black">NHTSA's objective is to receive professional services to </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">evaluate the effectiveness of community-oriented seat belt and impaired driving enforcement projects modeled after proven law enforcement models (e.g., DDACTS &amp; SARA) with respect to increasing community support for enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Solicitation Information:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The Government contemplates the award of a single Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance of the IDIQ contracts will not to exceed forty (40) months. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at <a href="https://www.fedbizopps.gov/">https://www.fedbizopps.gov</a> referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times', 'serif'; COLOR: black">15R00008</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about February 14, 2015. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</span></p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  Service and Maintenance for ASML PAS5500/275D i-Line stepper lithography system
<SOLNBR>NB620010-15-00535
<RESPDATE>012315
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Harry L. Brubaker, Contract Specialist, Email Harry.Brubaker@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with ASML US of Tempe, Arizona for the purchase of a service and maintenance plan for NIST's existing ASML PAS5500/275D i-Line stepper lithography system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p><br />NIST has a requirement for a multiyear service and maintenance plan for its ASML PAS5500/275D i-Line stepper lithography system which supports research in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies through collaboration. Due to its use as a shared resource in a user facility, it is imperative that the instrument be serviced regularly and repaired promptly in order to keep downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>ASML deploys service engineers who are fully trained and certified on its proprietary ASML COACH diagnostic software. This proprietary COACH diagnostic software, which is available exclusively to ASML engineers, serves as an up-to-the-moment service and maintenance manual describing in detail the proper procedures to repair and maintain the ASML stepper. Having access to this diagnostic software is critically important as the ASML stepper is a very complicated system made up of many electrical and mechanical subsystems and components. The ASML COACH software explains in detail the operation, diagnostics, and repair of all the components found on the stepper and provides comprehensive guidance to the service engineer on how to perform maintenance and repair operations correctly.</p>
<p>In addition, ASML is the only source for factory-certified, OEM replacement parts. ASML does not sell replacement parts through distributors or third-party service companies.</p>
<p>A factory-trained engineer with experience in ASML stepper systems and the COACH diagnostic software is required for comprehensive service and maintenance of this instrument. ASML COACH diagnostic software and factory-certified parts are proprietary and are available exclusively through ASML US. <br /><br />ASML US is the only contractor that can provide comprehensive service and maintenance for the ASML PAS5500/275D i-Line stepper lithography system. Therefore, ASML US is uniquely qualified to provide the required service and maintenance.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule. This requirement is expected to be awarded in April, 2015.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $20.5M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 23, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and the proposed/contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may
identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. Quotes received prior to the award date will be considered by the Government.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The subject
item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.

as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VISN 5
Justification and Approval For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Activity:

Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 5, 209 W. Fayette St. Suite D605, Baltimore, MD 21201

Requisition No. Funded/Paid thru VA Form 138, Obligation or Change in Obligation, in accordance with Volume  II -Chapter 6

2.	Nature and/or Description  of the Action Being Processed:

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), the VA has a requirement which can only be reasonably met by a single supplier. This action is to establish a new Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Today's Care and Family at this time may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow on contract, when it is likely that an award to another source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The Baltimore, Perry Point VA Medical Center (PP/ Baltimore VAMHCS) anticipates entering into a sole source acquisition negotiation for eligible Veterans to "continue" receiving Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services located in MD.

Today's Care and Family is currently supporting the VAMC by providing service which would otherwise require nursing home placement. ADHC services will be furnished to Veterans in the community for whom such care is specifically authorized by the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS).  Provided services include Registered Nurse/Case Manager to VA veteran patients.

The Government anticipates awarding a Basic Ordering Agreements, in accordance with FAR 16.703. A binding contract is will be formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this BOA, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agrees non-VA is required and the contractor agrees to accept the patient and provide direct patient care services. Upon acceptance by the Contractor of beneficiaries of VA, all clauses and terms and conditions of this BOA shall apply and become a part of the resultant contract during such time as VA patient remains in the contractor care at the expense of VA.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

A Sole source award will be made to Today's Care and Family for continuous services to veterans and eligible beneficiaries. Today's Care and Family hereafter referred to as "ADHC" will provide care to include: activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, adult day health care services.  Striving to meet and maintain the healthcare needs and promote maximum wellbeing, a break in continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and "negatively" impact the quality of life for this aged Veteran population who require critical assisted services and supportive environment.

This Basic Ordering Agreement cost estimate is as follow: (5)-Five Year Cost Estimate:  $261,092.54
 


Period of Performance	Annual Amount	Annual Income	Increase Amount	Annual Amount
Base Period	$50898.72	0.00%	$	$ 50898.72
Option Period 1	$50898.72	1.28%	$651.50	$ 51550.22
Option Period 2	$51550.22	1.28%	$659.84	$ 52210.06
Option Period 3	$52210.06	1.28%	$668.29	$ 52878.35
Option Period 4	$52878.35	1.28%	$676.84	$ 53555.19
Grand Est. 5
Years		$261092.54


o	COR's IGCE: $261,092.54
o	Contracting Officer's (CO) Cost Estimate: Placements will be made in contract facilities based in availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families. Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility; the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums. However, based on a usage rate of one veteran for 365 days, a reasonable estimate for the value of any particular contract would be around $50,000 per year, with many facilities experiencing authorized Veteran populations in excess of 15 per year. Daily rate differ depending on negotiated terms based on the Medicare Rate. Five-(5) Year estimate: $250.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) (A): Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Demonstration  that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the
Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

As noted in paragraph 3, ADHC services are essential to the provision of planned programming designed to promote social and health related services to aging Veterans in the service area who are no longer able to manage independently or who are isolated without an essential support network to facilitate needed care services. A break in the continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and negatively impact the wellbeing of the aged Veteran population who require assisted services and supportive environment. Recompleting the services would result in a change in services to the existing Veterans who already are enrolled and receiving service based on medical necessity for years.

Veterans with long term psychiatric conditions or organic brain dysfunctions would likely experience  a decline in functioning or experience an exacerbation in their level of functioning mentally, emotionally, and physically resulting from a disruption or change in vendor. A decrease in stability could potentially lead to irreversible harm or even death. (Note: stability with respect to such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of an individual from a vendor). Consistency in their therapeutic milieu is warranted. The primary goal is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest attainable level of health and well-being, thus Veteran treatment should be focused on stabilizing symptoms as much as possible. The benefit of a supportive environment would serve both veterans and their caregivers.

Discontinuation of the current contract services will cause an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement  for Veteran  support and  cause substantial  duplication  of cost to the Government  that  is not 
expected to be recovered through competition .

The current facility have and will continue to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.

6.	Description  of  Efforts  Made  to  ensure  that  offers  are  solicited  from  as  many  potential   sources as deemed practicable:

A notice of Intent to sole source will be published on FedBizOpps.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

In order to determine whether the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable, the Contract Specialist will review the proposed rates against VHA Benchmark rates. If the contractor's proposed price appears to be questionable for reasonableness, a justification from the contractor will be required in order to determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable before award.

8.	Description of the Market Research  Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:

Research was conducted on a limited basis due to the limitation of the geographic area. Research was conducted to establish ADHC contract services located throughout the local VA 's catchment area to provide homemaker services to Veterans near or as near as possible to family or friends. Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patient's population in the catchment area and resources availability of the VA Medical Center. The objective is to maximize patient care while maintaining compliance with VA regulations.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Continuing service is critical to Veterans to sustain a quality of life at an acceptable level.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: Not Applicable for this requirement.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition  before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:

The Contracting Office has identified way to improve and increase competition for the medical services in areas where completion can be considered . Approval not to compete does require VA Director and Chief of Staff approval prior to acquiring the medical services. The procurement action will be posted to the Government Point of Entry. Any responses will be referred the GEC coordinator for future consideration and marker research of source availability.

12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification  is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
I certify the technical requirements are accurate and complete to support the recommendation of other than full and open competition.

<DESC>Request For Information<br />Legislative Clock System<br />Architect of the Capitol
<p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) for its Legislative Clock System (LCS) requirement. This is for market research purposes only. This LCS requirement will be used to develop, design and build a new alternate LCS that can be used in conjunction with the existing Spectracom system. This requirement is not to replace the existing Spectracom system in its entirety. Instead it will replace the existing Spectracom clocks with the new LCS clocks as replacements are needed.</p>
<p>The Buy American Act will apply to this requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to allow industry to provide comments to AOC on the stated requirements and state if a solution per the Government's requirements is feasible. In addition, the AOC is asking that vendors provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to provide an estimate on what the total cost of this project may be. Vendors are requested to include in their ROM the total labor price, total equipment price, total manufacturing and price for purchasing rights to vendor's design specifications to arrive at the total estimated price. The vendor does not have to provide its response to the RFI or the ROM in accordance with the instructions in Section L. Sections L &amp; M are provided so that the vendors can&nbsp;submit comments to these sections along with comments to the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This RFI is also conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for AOC's LCS requirement. Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded an AOC procurement. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM profile. Vendors shall also state if they participate in any Government wide contracts such as General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule.</p>
<p>This is not a Request For Proposals. Proposals are not being solicited nor will an award be made from this RFI. AOC will not reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this RFI. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall be sent to Jennifer Henley at jhenley@aoc.gov. Responses are due no later than 4:00 pm ET on January 23, 2015.</p>

<DESC><p>The Library of Congress&nbsp;(LOC) is&nbsp;conducting MARKET RESEARCH. This Request for Information (RFI) is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists regarding a potential future solicitation. This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for respondents to express interest and provide information regarding their relevant capabilities, as well as provide feedback on LOC's requirement.&nbsp; Information submitted in response to this RFI may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research of our organization's capability.</p>
<p><br />The Government is developing a Statement of Work for Print Management Systems.&nbsp; Responses should be in&nbsp;a White Paper and contain three elements:<br />1.&nbsp;Your commercial capability that&nbsp;addresses the LOC requirement.<br />2. Your strategy and plan to&nbsp;meet the LOC requirement.<br />3. Pricing Information.</p>
<p>Section 1: Print Management Solution for Library Administration</p>
<p>1. The Library of Congress generally defines this requirement as what is known in the industry as Managed Print Services. This requirement would include supply and maintenance of existing printers, designated copiers, scanners and new devices throughout LOC.&nbsp; This requirement would best serve LOC as the single control point for maintenance and monitoring of the printing environment and its operational productivity levels where all printers are managed on the network. Maintenance of current equipment and removal of obsolete or excess equipment is essential.&nbsp; LOC requires a solution which will also help to identify a wide range of innovative and cost effective solutions to printing, copying scanning in our environment as well as identifying opportunities to lower costs and improve performance and operational efficiency, reduce print costs and raise environmental sustainability performance under a Managed Print Service Program. Currently the approximate number of devices is 1800 local printers 540 networked printers, and other device and approximately another 220 printers and 82 copiers on a separate network. <br /><br />2. By utilizing a Print Management System, LOC will gain the ability to monitor all print jobs and costs, analyze paper and toner needs, define opportunities and realize savings. <br /><br />3. Part of a potential Managed Print Services solution is The Administrative Copy Program, which&nbsp;consists of approximately 180 MFD and various other devices located in the Library's three main buildings on Capitol Hill, and at three outlying annexes located at Taylor Street NW, Landover, Maryland, FT. Meade, Maryland, and the facility at Culpepper, VA. This LOC program must be considered in the context and scope of a Managed Print Solution for our unique agency.<br /><br />4. Vendors must be capable of submitting multiple business models/ options including but not limited to cost per copy model, lease, and rent and buy options for new equipment. <br /><br />5. Vendors must provide capabilities pertaining to asset recovery programs and handling of e-waste.<br /><br />6. Security is crucial. Potential solution must be able to meet LOC ITS Security requirements (i.e. follows NIST IT security standards) for any and all proposed options. <br />7.&nbsp;LOC require a digital, networked solution utilizing multi-functional devices integrated in accordance with the provided security requirement to copy, print and scan. If a proposed feature cannot connect to the network because it does not meet stated security concerns, this limitation must be highlighted and noted. <br /><br />8. Copying - It is anticipated that the current configuration will remain largely unchanged in the first year. LOC requires continuity of current copy services through Multi-Functional Devices (MFD), and reduce total number of MFDs in proportion with new printers introduced with a print management solution. Current specifications must be maintained or improved:</p>
<p>9. LOC requires a system that must be able to provide tiered levels of security so that specific functions are limited to specifically authorized staff.<br /><br />10. All copiers must be able to use paper containing 30 percent post-consumer fiber (30%PC). (See Executive Order 13101.)</p>
<p>11. Copiers shall copy to within 3/16 inch of the leading edge of paper and to within 1/8 inch of the remaining three edges. Copiers shall include a border (edge) erase feature.</p>
<p>12. Print and copy quality produced by the offered copiers shall meet or exceed manufacturers published commercial quality standards (to be included with proposal.).</p>
<p>13. Models shall perform satisfactorily at any relative humidity between 15 and 85 percent.</p>
<p>14. Copiers shall feature a definite indicator of when the equipment is energized. This may be either a special power on light or an appropriate indicator on the control panel. Copiers shall have an automatic energy saving feature with instant-on capability.</p>
<p>15. Models shall be capable of operating on 115 Volt 60 Hz AC electrical current. Copiers with higher voltage requirements shall be highlighted.</p>
<p><br />Section 2: Print Shop Program</p>
<p>LOC's Print Shop currently provides in-house printing and duplication services for service units of the Library; including print-on-demand (POD) and large format printing. The objective is to further develop capability and increase service offerings, perhaps via a web/browser based application, to streamline the process for customers to request print services, graphic work, print jobs, and to account for printing expenses and chargebacks.&nbsp;LOC wish to have presented through the use of the print management software, savings and various print choices which are highlighted during every print decision costs, including the option of using the LOC Print Shop.</p>
<p>This solution should enable LOC to utilize the LOC print shop in more efficient ways that help to define a plan for rightsizing the device fleet, and LOC to identify ways to potentially further reduce costs in the future.</p>
<p>For all Programs referenced in this document except the Reading Room solution, an internal charge-back solution is needed to "charge back" all copying/printing/ for common MFDs and in particular move production work to in the print shop. The Reading Room application mentioned below is another necessary charge for print program which differs in that it interfaces with patrons, researchers, Congress and the public. LOC is open to reviewing separate or combined solutions for these Programs.</p>
<p>2.1 Job Submission Software for the Print Shop</p>
<p>LOC has an interest in solutions that allow end users to submit print jobs electronically to the Print Shop using industry standard browsers for centralized production or decentralized print. The solution walks end users through each step of identifying their print needs, develop final print files, select print options, such as paper and binding, and automatically receive a job estimate.</p>
<p>Web-based printing potentially generates cost savings and improvements in output quality, productivity, and turnaround time. Proposed solutions must incorporate this vision as part of the overall solution or separately. The integration of these different programs is a requirement of this procurement and will be evaluated. LOC will evaluate the responses to this requirement as part of the eventual scoring methodology.</p>
<p><br />Section 3: Public Reading Rooms in the Library of Congress</p>
<p>Vendors should consider two significant factors. First, the need to meet customer demand through the provision of products and services expected and received as standard in many peer institutions and across the marketplace. Second, the need to establish a transparent cost-recovery model, one that maximizes efficiencies and economies of scale, and allows LOC to set an affordable fee schedule for a wide range of services.</p>
<p>Vendors shall provide traditional and multi-function capacities that provide the patrons of the reading rooms with a full range of contemporary options for imaging, transmitting, and printing output. The solution should also provide LOC with greater operational efficiencies, cost savings, and revenue generation opportunities.</p>
<p>As an institution, LOC would provide a complete service environment for researchers and other patrons of its reading rooms, but new capabilities would vary from reading room to reading room, with equipment and services being provided in relation to collection type, material format, demand (volume) and condition of materials. The program will also create an efficient, fee-based imaging service that best meets&nbsp;LOC's operational and financial goals. Implementation would maximize cost effectiveness, streamline workflow, document use and optimize outputs.</p>
<p>This RFI will introduce a fundamental change to the way LOC manages its public printing, copying, and scanning services. LOC wishes to establish a feature-rich print management environment in the 19 reading rooms of the Library of Congress. Objectives include:</p>
<p>&bull; Greatly reduce the inventory of desktop printers; <br />&bull; transition from analog equipment to digital; <br />&bull; network all imaging equipment to establish demand, volume, and cost; <br />&bull; reduce overhead costs associated with paper and ink;<br />&bull; Improve available services to include industry-standard services such as color, secure printing, scanning, scan-to-email etc.</p>
<p>Vendor's White Paper&nbsp;should address implementation in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. The replacement of the traditional decentralized service model with an integrated print management solution.<br /><br />2. A chargeback system that identifies which services (printing, copying, and scanning) can be incorporated into a self-service, fee-based structure and how it can be implemented.<br /><br />3. The introduction of a network printing to replace desktop PC-printing.<br /><br />4. The inclusion of the microfilm reader-printer service into the print management solution.<br /><br />5. The introduction of scan-to-email capability from MFDs.<br /><br />6. The introduction of color printing and copying<br /><br />7. Mobile Printing which would allow patrons to print from their personal hand held devices such as IPad, Tablets and smart phones.<br /><br />8. Secure print environments which would allow for the creation of individualized queues which only the patron could access using a log on or other identification method such as a smart card.<br /><br />9. Ability to protect collections in a small number of instances where a reading room does not want to provide copying of brittle materials. A &lsquo;lock' device or alternative machine is required in these instances.<br /><br />10. Charge printing costs to patrons on a per copy basis Print equipment meets industry standards and specifications, and/or appropriate levels of performance related to reading room usage.<br /><br />11. Protect privacy of the individuals doing the printing by limiting access to one's own print jobs.<br /><br />12. Meet LOC security requirements for IT. <br /><br />13. Configure workstations, printers, and photocopiers in a way that optimizes workflow in a particular area. Print jobs might be directed either to a photocopier or networked printer depending on volume of usage of the copier or printer and the room configuration.<br /><br />14. Allows staff and/or customers to print without being charged. This would facilitate free printing as necessary for Congress-related matters, and information exchange with reading room staff concerning bibliographic references and meet basic service expectations.<br /><br />15. It is desirable that a watermark designates the source of the material being copied and states general copyright restrictions.<br /><br />16. Have the same charge mechanism for all publically-used imaging and printing services including printers, photocopiers, microform reader-printers, and MFD-enabled scanners.<br /><br />17. Enable the direct replacement of all equipment associated with the current value-card system used by the LOC, including card readers, coin stations, and value-cards.<br /><br />18. Manual value pads to program card value will be available during transition period, or appropriate approach to allow for the transition of all DAC Card Readers to new system.<br /><br />19. Value-cards should be provided on an annual or semi-annual basis, or best agreed-upon method.<br /><br />20. The solution should consolidate where possible so that fewer charge boxes and other enabling devices are required. <br /><br />21. Provide an efficient, convenient and cost-effective means for users to purchase and add funds to their accounts or cards.<br /><br />22. Users must be able to purchase cards on site in a manner that is service oriented and financially feasible.<br /><br />23. Users must be able to use cash to purchase copy cards on site for convenience and to maintain anonymity if desired. LOC&nbsp;prefers that users have the ability to use credit cards to make purchases on site as well as long as regulations regarding use of credit card purchases are addressed before implementation.<br /><br />24. Users must also be able to purchase copy cards at dedicated non-reading room site to allow for customer service and account management as necessary. The implemented system must allow for manual user data input by appropriate LOC staff members.<br /><br />25. Provide a comprehensive means of tracking usage and charges made against the system to facilitate effective back-office accounting.<br /><br />26. All functions of the cost-recovery system must be accessible by authorized LOC staff members to enable them to replace damaged copy cards, retrieve cash or credit cards from jammed card-purchase kiosks and to override incorrect transactions.<br /><br />27. System must be able to provide tiered levels of security so that specific functions are limited to specifically authorized staff.</p>
<p>3.1 Microform Reader-Printers</p>
<p>LOC currently uses about 40 microform reader-printers which are purchased by the individual reading rooms. Most reader-printers are operated with charge cards and serviced by a third-party vendor. Reading rooms also have 50 digital microform scanners, for which currently there is no charge for printing and it is possible to download digital files from them using an attached PC. The digital microfilm machines will be placed on the network and allow for printing through the proposed system.</p>
<p>A method of charging for prints made on the non-networked analog Microfilm reader printers must be included in the proposal. The number of machines will decrease as they are replaced with digital versions but there will always be a small number in the inventory.</p>
<p>3.2 Mobile Printing</p>
<p>Within LOC's Print Re-engineering Plans are considerations for Mobile Printing. Mobile printing is the process of sending data to a printer wirelessly from a smartphone, laptop, or tablet. LOC is interested in mobile printing solutions that would grant LOC staff, researchers, and Congress the ability to print wirelessly at LOC from any mobile device, such as a smartphone, tablet or a laptop, to an ePrint-enabled or wireless printer.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;solution must provide security options that could possibly utilize hard disk encryption or erase options for MFDs where additional security is needed when handling sensitive or confidential information.</p>
<p>Vendors&nbsp;shall address in the White Paper solutions that meet&nbsp;the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Charge printing costs to patrons on a per copy basis. <br /><br />2. Provide print management solution for current reader printers<br /><br />3. Be able to transition all enabling equipment for print management from old reader printer to new digital printers as they are networked<br /><br />4. Be able to print scanned images to hard-copy via MFDs<br /><br />5. Protect privacy of the individuals doing the printing by limiting access to one's own print jobs.<br /><br />6. Meet LOC security requirements for IT. <br /><br />7. It is desirable that a watermark designates the source of the material being copied and states general copyright restrictions</p>
<p>3.3 Scanning</p>
<p>Currently photocopy machines cannot be used as scanners because they have not been networked. Some reading rooms have flatbed scanners available for LOC staff use and staff occasionally allows patrons to use these scanners. Some reading rooms also have overhead scanners for patron use which have been purchased by the reading rooms. Currently there is no charge for the use of available scanners. &nbsp;LOC wants to provide regular scanning from MFDs as part of the scope of work, and to have the ability to charge for these scans if&nbsp;LOC chooses to do so.</p>
<p>Vendors&nbsp;shall address in their White Paper&nbsp;solutions that meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Provide scan-to-email capability through MFDs. <br /><br />2. Provide a plan to include, the capability through equipment and software to allow MFD scanning. <br /><br />3. Be able to print scanned images to hard-copy. <br /><br />4. Be able to scan items in reading rooms that are in odd sizes and/or are somewhat fragile. <br /><br />5. It is desirable that a watermark designates the source of the material being copied and states general copyright restrictions.<br /><br />6. Provide a plan to include the ability to tag digital file with information on the file's origin and copyright restrictions in such a way that the tagging is both visible when viewed on a computer screen and when printed on tangible materials.</p>
<p>3.4 Color</p>
<p>Currently, only one reading room provides a color copier and, with the current free printing policies, it is not possible to offer color printing at all.&nbsp; Vendors shall&nbsp;address color printing and copying in all reading rooms and be able to charge an appropriate price for higher cost of color printing.</p>
<p>Vendors shall address in their White Paper&nbsp;solutions that meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Use of an MFD model that provides color and black and white print options.<br /><br />2. Use of an MFD model that provides color and black and white copy options.<br /><br />3. Networking of printers with an appropriate charge mechanism for black and white and color options, with fees set at different rates.</p>
<p>3.5 Cost Recovery</p>
<p>LOC currently uses a third-party vendor for cost-recovery on duplication equipment.&nbsp; A separate charge box is used for each photocopier and microform reader-printer at a significant cost per box. Most of these charge boxes accept copy cards but a few still only accept coins. At this point there is no charge mechanism for the use of desktop laser printers or scanners.</p>
<p>Vendors&nbsp;will facilitate and provide detailed floor plans of all final equipment locations, based on reading room configurations, reading room policies, and ITS and Architect of the Capital (AOC)&nbsp;requirements for drops and related infrastructure.</p>
<p>Vendors&nbsp;shall provide a method for transitioning from the current DAC card reader system to any new card reader system. Manual value pads to program card value will be available during transition period to allow the transition of all DAC Card Readers in as short a period as possible.<br /><br />The plan should be delivered two weeks after the effective period of performance begins.</p>
<p>A Print Management System (PMS) responsive to public services, industry trends and revenue generation.</p>
<p>LOC currently charges a fee for photocopying and microfilm printing in the reading rooms. Additionally, LOC needs the ability to charge for PC printing, and for scanning. As a revenue-generating activity, LOC is making assumptions about a print management solution:<br />&bull; Black and white printing has been declining for over a decade and will continue to do so.<br />&bull; Networking printing in the reading rooms will automatically reduce use by 50%. <br />&bull; Color printing and copying will increase, as it would be a new service.<br />&bull; On-site printing will increasingly be replaced by scanning options, and LOC must have the option to track and charge for equipment usage. <br />&bull; Vendors should be prepared to offer ideas on how to ideally migrate to credit card and/or smartcard use.</p>
<p><br />Section 4: General Requirements</p>
<p>A PMS that reduces cost and increases flexibility.</p>
<p><br />In additional to requesting a pricing schedule in the RFI, LOC welcomes suggestions around alternate pricing arrangements that would lower LOC's total cost of ownership. Examples may include purchasing, renting, leasing, volume pricing or discounts, and &lsquo;no cost contract' (i.e., vendor assumes all cost, and all revenue)</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS<br />1. Critical Copiers: These copiers must be repaired and returned to service within two hours so that the mission of the Library will not be jeopardized.</p>
<p>2. Magnetic Card Encoding System: This system includes the equipment access units and magnetic card vending machines owned by the Library and manufactured by Digital Access Control, Inc.</p>
<p>3. Magnetic Card Vending Machine: The machines used by the public to purchase and/or add money amounts to magnetic cards to allow the operation of copying equipment.</p>
<p>4. Maintenance: Maintenance includes all labor, parts, consumable supplies (except paper), service, and repairs necessary to maintain proper operation of all copiers during contract performance. It does not include repair of damage resulting from factors clearly beyond the control of the Contractor, such as accident, inappropriate use, failure or interruption of electrical power, or failure of air-conditioning or humidity controls.</p>
<p>5. Meter Reading: A reflection of the number of copies made on each copier.</p>
<p>Pricing Information</p>
<p>LOC is looking for a best value and lowest total cost of ownership (TCO), where value is the optimal combination of cost, service quality, and technical capability required to meet the Library's needs, and TCO is the total cost of the solution over the length of the contract.

<DESC>(This notice was posted previously as AMD-14-SS50)<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a service agreement for the service and maintenance of JEOL instruments and their associated components to ensure uninterrupted performance within manufacturers' specifications on a scheduled and emergency/as-needed basis. Most of the instruments are located at NIST's Gaithersburg, Maryland location, but three are located at the Boulder, Colorado campus.
<p><br />The required service and maintenance agreement will provide for routine maintenance and calibration to ensure that the covered instruments continuously meet the manufacturer's specifications. The required service agreement shall guarantee the full system performance of these instruments, including third-party accessories, if these components have been purchased through JEOL and are covered under the warranty or current service contract.</p>
<p>In addition, these instruments occasionally require emergency/as-needed service to repair faults, failures, and sudden degradation in the performance envelope of the instrument. Accordingly, the required service and maintenance agreement shall include unlimited emergency/as-needed visits during regular business hours in addition to scheduled preventive maintenance visits.</p>
<p>The required service agreement shall cover expenses including all parts, labor, travel, and per diem. The Contractor shall repair/replace all parts (i.e., hardware, software, accessory components/systems) required for the operation of the covered JEOL instruments.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for a service agreement to ensure uninterrupted performance within manufacturers' specifications, on a scheduled and emergency/ as-needed basis, for each of the JEOL instruments listed below:</p>
<p>1. Scanning Auger Model 7830F Gaithersburg</p>
<p>2. Field Emission SEM Model JSM-7100FT/LV Gaithersburg</p>
<p>3. E-beam Lithography System Model JBX 6300-FS Gaithersburg</p>
<p>4. E-beam Lithography System Model JBX 6300-FS Gaithersburg</p>
<p>5. Field Emission SEM Model SM17610023 Gaithersburg</p>
<p>6. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Model EM133020-21 Boulder</p>
<p>7. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Model JSM-6100 Boulder</p>
<p>8. TEM Model JEM-3010 Gaithersburg</p>
<p>9. Field Emission SEM Model JSM-7100 Gaithersburg</p>
<p>10. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Model NM113507-020 Gaithersburg</p>
<p>11. Aberration Corrected Scanning TEM Model EM171000052 Boulder</p>
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications developed for the maintenance and service agreement, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 811219, as those domestic sources with annual revenue of $20.5M or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that provide such maintenance and service agreements for JEOL equipment are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your services or capabilities.

<DESC>Introduction/Synopsis<br />This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources including small and small disadvantaged businesses to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p>Background<br />This Division of DAIDS (DAIDS), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has an existing requirement for a project entitled "NIAID Preclinical Development Support," with Advanced BioScience Laboratory, Inc. under contract number HHSN2722001100021I.<br />This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract was awarded on a competitive basis for a seven year period from August 29, 2011 through August 28, 2018. The purpose of the contract is to provide preclinical development support for promising candidates when such candidates emerge from investigator-Initiated research studies. The total value of the IDIQ contract is a maximum of $102,500,000.</p>
<p>The development of vaccines and any other mucosally/systemically deliverable entities to prevent the spread of HIV infection is among the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) highest priorities. In addition, vaccines administered to infected individuals have potential for inducing immune control of the infectious agent. While advances in immunology and molecular biology continue to offer an expanding array of approaches for the development of new vaccines/products, there is limited capacity to move promising concepts through the development process. In order to supplement limited industry involvement in developing vaccines, the NIAID sponsors a nontraditional, proactive and developmentally-oriented contract to provide preclinical development support for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies. NIAID uses this contract to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps. These functions support the fundamental goals of the Vaccine Translational Research Branch (VTRB) under the Vaccine Research Program (VRP), Division of AIDS (DAIDS).</p>
<p>This Sources Sough Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NIAID.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of this Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought Notice is to discern whether or not there are other contractors, including small or small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the potential requirement detailed below. A formal solicitation and performance work statement are not available. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for access to updated database of oil and gas wells, reservoirs, and fields worldwide.  The Government anticipates award to begin May 30, 2015 for a Base Year with (4) optional 1-year periods.  The contractor shall meet or exceed all database requirements by May 30, 2015.  The contractors data shall be existing, updated at least annually, and made available by the Contractor to the USGS via CDROM/DVD, web service and oracle database formats, with retrieval, viewing and manipulation applications.  The contractors database shall consist of updated data on a minimum 4.5 million wells for the United States, 700,000 wells in Canada and 700,000 for the remainder of the world.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519190, All Other Information Services, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $27.5M.  The SBA Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) applies to this procurement.  
Historically, the database subscriptions have been procured from IHS Global, Inc., 15 Inverness Way E, Englewood, CO 80112-5710 which provided access to the following IHS database systems: E&P Data Worldwide Data including: Worldwide Cartography, Worldwide Fields / Field Images, Worldwide Wells, Worldwide Survey, and Enerdeq Desktop databases; Questor Offshore / Onshore S&M; IHS Enerdeq Browser; PI/Dwights Plus Well data - Total U.S.; PI/Dwights Plus Production data - Total U.S. (TX, LA Alloc); US PowerTools - Network License; and Petra S&M Network Perpetual. 
The IHS database systems are known to meet or exceed the requirements outlined below to provide detailed information on oil and gas exploration and production history for the United States, Canada and the World in support of Congressional Mandates to assess Undiscovered Oil and Gas Assessments.  The data must be consistently formatted and provided through numerous mechanisms to allow for easy search and retrieval of desired data. 
For the United States, the requirement is for detailed history of each well and production data for more than 4,500,000 wells from 1865 through 2015.  Well history must include well identifier (API), well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, target formation(s), formation tops, well status, well tests, and well physical descriptions.  USGS also require cross references to other data including: Cores, Well Log, Directional Surveys and Well Treatments.  Well history data must be consistently formatted for all wells throughout the United States in order to support studies that span numerous states.  Well Production must include volumes of oil, gas, natural gas liquid and water in a format that is consistent across the entire United States.  Production must include current well status, production tests, and other ancillary information that is reported to states.  The USGS requires extensive details of well fracturing treatments, including volumes of fluid injected, proppant weights, and water co-produced.  For states which report production on a lease level, the USGS requires the contractor to allocate to well level and provide documentation on allocation procedures.  Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum.
The USGS requires details on well history and production for Canada for more than 700,000 wells, from 1860s  through 2015.  This includes well identifier, well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, producing and target formation(s), well status, reported production volumes, well physical descriptions and field names.  Also needed are well pressure tests, pool analysis data and analysis software for Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.   Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum.
For other (excluding Canada and US) international data, the USGS requires detailed history for more than 700,000 international wells, from 1860s through 2015.  Well history must include well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, target formations, well status, well tests, well physical descriptions and associated field names.  The USGS requires a compilation of international oil and gas fields, including location, reserve estimates, production details, development history, typical geochemical composition and associated geologic descriptions.  Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum. The USGS requires efficient software interfaces to search and download these data.  Such software must allow query by all the attributes described above including:  Well identifier, name, geographic location, penetrating depth, producing formation, producing volumes, perforations, well status, operator, various dates, well type and well tests.   This search should be complimented with a map-based search and query interface and allow exports into a variety of industry-specific data formats, including 297 Well and 298 Production.  The USGS requires programmatic access to the data including:  local physical copy in Oracle database tables, web service access and web mapping service access.  
The USGS requires extensive documentation on the methodology for compiling information, including details on currency of updates, a detailed data dictionary and direct access to contractor management to ensure the USGS is effectively using the data.  
All business concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information to the contracting officer no later than 1700 ET Monday, October 27, 2014 :

<a href="mailto:william.d.tenz.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The US Army, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) seeks companies interested in entering into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) to study the compatibility of Industry's existing turret systems with the XM813 30mm Medium Caliber  Weapon System when mounted to an armored fighting vehicle platform (tentatively a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) or Stryker).  Participating partners will be responsible for funding their own activities, as no Government funding will be provided for this effort. <br>  <br> The results of these planned compatibility assessments and comparisons will aid ARDEC's determination of an optimal Industry turret for tentative follow-on CRADAs to demonstrate the accuracy and lethality of the XM813 in an LAV or Stryker platform.  The number of such follow-on CRADAs to be executed is dependent on the availability of internal Government resources to conduct the planned follow-on demonstrations.  Companies providing turrets under the initial turret system are expected to commit to a follow-on integration and demonstration should ARDEC select their technology as an optimal fit.   <br>  <br> As with the initial assessment, companies participating in these follow-on CRADAs will be responsible for funding their own activities.  However, should these follow-on demonstrations occur, the Government will be responsible for providing the weapon systems, sensors, vehicle platforms, test facilities, test equipment, ammunition, necessary documentation, and available expertise to allow live fire testing at a future date. <br>  <br> The U.S. Government prefers technical data disclosure, and subsequent partnering, with U.S. based companies.  Non-U.S. nationals, or those representing non-U.S. industries, must consider how to address data export restrictions (through partnering or other means) should a CRADA be pursued. ARDEC is open to discussions with foreign industry representatives with the understanding that the material and technical data disclosed would be limited to open source information and no sensitive or classified information will be discussed. <br>  <br> ARDEC asks all interested parties to submit a short informational paper to include but not limited to: turret description, photos and turret performance information. Submissions should be sent to Daniel Pierrez, 973.724.8644, Daniel.pierrez.civ@mail.mil.   All submissions must be provided by January 30, 2015.  These information papers should describe how the interested partners' may meet the objectives cited above.  This may include a summary of candidate turret systems and relevant expertise, facilities and experience in weapons systems integration.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. All information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only. <br>

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command - APG, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland 21005-1846, intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source modification with Lockheed Martin MST, P.O. Box 4840, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and FAR 6.302-1, as per Justification and Approval (J&A) Control Number 15-C010.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) intends to contract with Vantiv, Inc. on a sole source basis for EMV-enabled payment card terminals, PIN pads, device software, and associated professional services.  Vantiv has been identified as the only source capable of fully satisfying the requirements in an arrangement that meets the needs of the Fiscal Service.<em>&nbsp; <br /><br />Pursuant to Executive Order 13681, the Fiscal Service requires that EMV-enabled Ingenico and Verifone terminals and PIN pads be obtained, implemented, and functioning at all Fiscal Service Card Acquiring Service (CAS) program client agency sites no later than September 30, 2015.  Reference "Attachment A" for additional specifications.  Once implemented, the new and updated EMV-enabled terminals must properly interface and fully function within Fiscal Service's existing CAS program.&nbsp; <br /><br /></em><em>The Fiscal Service's CAS program is currently managed by the financial agent Fifth Third Bank.  Fifth Third Bank supports CAS client agencies' payment card processing needs through its partnering acquirer/processor, Vantiv.</em><em>&nbsp; <br /><br />Vantiv is responsible for supporting CAS client agencies through standalone and wireless terminal provision, device maintenance, real-time direct data links for transaction authorization and processing, client agency support, customer service, and other miscellaneous functions.  All CAS-supported agency payment card terminals must be certified by Vantiv in order to be eligible to process card transactions through the existing CAS program managed by Fifth Third Bank.  Standalone and wireless payment card terminals rely on Vantiv-specific and Vantiv-certified software to perform their essential card reading, authorization, and transaction processing operations.  EMV-enabling software loaded on EMV-enabled payment card terminals will require testing and certification by Vantiv prior to deployment.  Agencies deploying EMV-enabled terminals must connect to and validate with the Vantiv network.</em><em>&nbsp; <br /><br />Additionally, the support model, maintenance arrangements, and device warranties must be preserved under the Fiscal Service's existing CAS program.</em>&nbsp; <br /><br />No formal solicitation is available.  Requests for additional information and/or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response to this special notice.  Telephone responses or inquiries to this special notice will not be accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fiscal Service will consider written vendor responses received by the established deadline; 11:59 PM (ET) on February 9, 2015.  Responses must be submitted electronically to the following email address:  purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov.  Responding vendors shall reference "SS-FSA-15-0020 Attn: SN/KH" in the subject line of the email.  Responses must include sufficient evidence clearly demonstrating a vendor's capability to fully satisfy the requirements.  If no acceptable responses are received, Fiscal Service will proceed with an award to Vantiv on a sole source basis.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition to necessary technical information specific to this requirement, qualified vendors shall also provide the following:  name and location of company, contact information, business size and any socioeconomic classifications; DUNS number; whether or not the company's services are available through an existing Government-wide vehicle; a brief capabilities statement (not exceeding 5 pages) that includes a description of the company's standard line(s) of business and any customers/agencies for which similar products/services have or are being provided.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not a request for proposal/quote and does not imply an obligation on the part of the Government to purchase products/services.  Further, this special notice does not obligate the Government to ultimately pursue a particular acquisition strategy.&nbsp; <br /><br />All responding vendors are advised that responses to this notice, in and of themselves, will not be considered for contract award.  In the event that a resultant solicitation would ensue, interested parties would be required to respond separately and formally in order to be considered for contract award.  A determination not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this special notice would be at the sole discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center originally developed a Free Electron Laser (FEL) Ablation technique to synthesize single-walled carbon nanotubes. FEL provides a vast improvement over other techniques employed to make carbon nanotubes.  The nanotubes produced by FEL are very pure, straight, homogenous, and defect-free. Most notable is that these nanotubes can be produced in much larger quantities than by other laser-based techniques. Now NASA scientists have further provided incremental improvement in this technology by creating a recipe and procedure for the inexpensive and simple production of fine-grained targets required for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using FEL. Previously used targets employed metal powders that did not have a particularly small grain size or small size dispersibility. The targets used here are made of powder forge metals that are both small and dispersible. The targets facilitate a significant cost reduction in the supply of high quality single-walled carbon nanotubes.  The fine-grained targets are a matrix of a prismatic edge natural flake graphite that produces strong structural pi bonds when pressed at room temperature. The targets have an approximate grain size of 2 microns. The graphite provides a carbon source that is combined with a metal catalyst made of powder forge nickel and powder forge cobalt. Previously used targets involved pressing and binding targets with Dylon carbon cement. These particles had an approximate 200-micron particle size, which led to large regions of uncatalyzed target. The new metal powders are small (~0.5 microns), highly dispersible, and two orders of magnitude less expensive. The powders are mixed in appropriate quantities and subjected to low-energy ball-milling to ensure mingling. Targets undergo additional preparatory steps, including high pressure processing. The targets are then subjected to a series of ultrafast infrared laser light pulses at a high repetition rate to vaporize the layers of the spinning targets and create a plume of nanotubes.  U.S. patent application filed. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have NASA Langley Research Center has developed a new technology for measuring the junction temperature of laser diode arrays (LDAs) that can support dramatically improved LDA fault analysis and lifetime estimates. This technology provides better spatial and temporal resolution than spectral chirp or thermal imaging methods and can be integrated into existing LDA systems, such as laser diode drivers, without significant additional costs (including weight, power, and space). Potential applications include quality control and screening of LDAs for maximum lifetime, optimizing development of operational parameters, or providing real-time operational diagnostics/prognostics. NASAs Forward Voltage Short-Pulse Technique provides a novel alternative means to measure LDA junction temperature. Laser diode systems contain a driver that provides nominal quasi-continuous wave pulses. In this technique, a second driver is used to provide precise pulses between operational pulses. This facilitates the accurate derivation of junction temperatures by precisely measuring the voltage of these second pulses. Furthermore, this technique uses small injections of current, and resultantly does not contribute to any heat cycling issues within the LDA. Thermal cycling is a key mechanical stressor that can cause premature LDA failure. Competing technologies such as spectral chirp and thermal imaging do not provide the speed or spatial resolution to quickly locate hot spots at the junction of the LDA bars. Unlike these technologies, this technique can accurately measure the LDA thermal parameters, and, with little cost, can be easily incorporated into the operation of existing LDAs for real-time junction temperature monitoring. This in turn may facilitate the development of smart laser diode drivers that can adjust operating parameters to LDA conditions.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have designed a Multifunctional Boost Protective Cover (MBPC) for a Launch Abort System (LAS). In the event of a crewed launch, the innovation provides a redundant means of saving the crew, and for an unmanned launch, it provides the means for recovering a very expensive, sensitive, and/or dangerous payload. Reduced insurance premiums and elimination of delays to fabricate new complex satellite systems in the event of a failed launch contribute to cost savings. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees. The current design enables this increased redundancy with no detrimental impact to mass-to-orbit capability and, in effect, can increase the payload-to-orbit capability of the spacecraft by enabling the firing of the launch abort motor (LAM) during nominal missions to effect an increased delta-velocity or increased mass-to-orbit capability. The current invention enables the launch abort function and minimizes the generation and transmission of acoustic pressure to the payload and/or crew. In addition, the design accommodates inertial, structural, and thermal loads.  The innovation also reduces the structural mass of the crew or payload module by transferring the load-carrying structure to a multi-functional boost protective cover that is jettisoned early in the launch trajectory (prior to reaching the orbital velocity), thus reducing mass to orbit. The MBPC also has a very efficient aerodynamic shape that reduces drag and enables increased payload/mass to orbit.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Procurement: Market Research is being conducted to verify that no other sources can meet the requirement to manufacture, produce, and install the 108 modernization kits to nine locations.  Interested sources are invited to provide their company's capability statement to support this program as described in this Sources Sought program description, acquisition approach, and Delivery Schedule as described herein.  <br>  <br> Project Background: The Program Executive Office for Simulation Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement to modernize existing JPATS ATDs consisting of Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs), Instrument Flight Trainers (IFTs), and Unit Training Devices (UTDs) at six Air Force and three Navy sites.  The JPATS ATDs support pilot and flight officer training in the T-6 Texan II aircraft.  <br>  <br> The JPATS ATDs were procured by the T-6 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) (who became Hawker Beechcraft Corporation (HBC)  in May 2007) to support the aircraft program. The procurement was via a performance specification through a subcontract issued to FlightSafety International, Inc. (FSI) by the OEM.  FSI proposed and delivered to the OEM a proprietary solution involving both hardware and software.  Data rights were not procured by nor delivered to the Government or the OEM.  The original prime contractor, HBC, is no longer considered a viable solution to support the upgrades which are driven by obsolescence and concurrency issues.  This leaves FSI the only remaining viable source for this effort. <br>  <br> The effort consists of retrofitting all Electronic Control Loading Systems (ECLS) and Flight Deck Input/Output Systems (FDIOS) and upgrading all Windows XP and Windows 2000-based software to Windows 7 for 108 USAF and USN JPATS ATDs.  Additionally, the effort includes upgrading Aural Cueing Systems for the USN OFTs and UTDs, and the Image Generator Systems for the USN OFTs. <br>  <br> Acquisition Approach: PEO STRI Acquisition Center intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302 (a) (2) (ii) (A). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to pursue award of a delivery order under STOC II Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract W900KK-09-D-0338 to FlightSafety Services Corporation (FSSC), 10770 East Briarwood Avenue, Suite 100 Centennial, CO 80112.  Award to FSSC shall be in accordance with the authority defined by FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark   The government anticipates that the program for this effort will be fulfilled by the award of a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order in accordance with FAR Part 16, the period of performance for which is 24 months from award.

A list of representative items is attached hereto. Please note that items to be procured may slightly change over the life of the program. This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional solicitation will not be issued.
<p>1. Notice of Set-Aside:</p>
<p>This RFQ is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The Government anticipates issuing multiple one-year Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to the contractors found capable of providing the attached list of items. No individual order placed against a BPA shall exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p>2. Definition of Blanket Purchase Agreement:</p>

<p>3. Delivery:</p>
<p>Delivery shall be made to the sites detailed on individual orders and may be CONUS or OCONUS. Shipping costs will not be evaluated under this solicitation as they are dependent upon order quantities and mix that is unknown at this time. Shipping costs will be evaluated under the individual BPA orders.</p>
<p>Delivery/Acceptance term shall be FOB Destination. The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the orders, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p>4. Terms and Conditions:</p>

<p>5. Evaluation Criteria and Basis for Award:</p>
<p>a. Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Due to the voluminous nature of the list, the Government acknowledges that limited sources might be available capable of providing the list in its entirety. As these BPAs will be issued with the goal of establishing a suitable base for order-level competition, BPAs may be issued to contractors that are only capable of providing some of the list.</p>
<p>b. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: <br />(1) Price, and<br />(2) Past Performance.</p>
<p>1. Price: <br />Price evaluation will occur on a comparative item-by-item and total list basis. For evaluation purposes, all prices submitted shall be for a unit of 1 or, for those items identified in the attached list as a package, 1 package, and shall assume delivery within 30 days.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: <br />The Government will evaluate past performance as it pertains to providing similar items. Examples of representative past performance are requested. Failure to provide an example of relevant past performance is considered a valid basis for dismissal from further consideration for award under this solicitation. <br />6. Line Items: See attached requirements document for a complete list of anticipated BAMS equipment items. Contractors are encouraged to propose alternates if they believe substitution justified. Alternative items must be clearly denoted as such and marked with the legend "Alternate Item" and reference the replaced item. <br />&emsp;<br />7. NAICS:</p>

<CONTACT>Richard C Childres, Contract Specialist, Phone 315-330-4194, Fax 315-330-2555, Email richard.childres@us.af.mil
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation (paper copy) will not be issued. Further, offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of amendments (if any) or other information pertaining to this solicitation.
<p>Solicitation FA8751-15-R-0001 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20141216. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Total Small Business set-aside under NAICS code 334111 and size standard of 1,000 employees. However the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name but which proposes to furnish an item which it does not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government requires a turn-key high performance computing&nbsp;solution to be delivered and installed by the contract awardee. The parts items and required performance characteristics detailed in the requirements document ATTACHMENT 1, dated 07 JAN 2015, represent a technical solution that is known to fulfill the Government's requirement. Although the list of materials is based on Rittal and Hewlett-Packard products, offerors will be able to propose "brand name or equal" products (reference FAR 52.211-6). Proposals which include alternatives to the products identified in the description must be accompanied by technical documentation in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate compliance with the performance characteristics of this known solution (reference FAR 52.212-1(b)(4)). The required performance characteristics reflect the minimum salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that reflect the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs.</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide all items (or equal) on a Firm Fixed Price basis, including the cost of shipping FOB Destination and shall provide at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.</p>
<p>The anticipated date the contractor is expected to execute initial system start-up and commission for Government inspection is 70 days after contract award. All deliveries shall be made in accordance with FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination (Nov 1991). The place of delivery, acceptance and FOB destination point is Monterey, CA</p>
<p>SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENT<br /><br />POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p>
<p>(a) There is potential organizational conflict of interest (see FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest) due to the fact that performance of the contract involves access to information technology networks, servers and computers via higher level privileges; therefore it is assumed that any data on these networks, servers and computers could potentially be accessed by the contractor. Additionally, equipment procured under this solicitation will be inserted into a high performance computing competition. To preserve competition integrity and check the flow of information, employees, subcontractors, or affiliates of offerors may not participate in a capacity outside that of equipment supplier for the competition infrastructure. Further, the contractor is expected to agree to a non-disclosure agreement that protects disclosure or improper use of each competitor's proprietary data at any time during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(1) The following restrictions apply:</p>
<p>(i) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the contracting officer may (A) disqualify the offeror, or (B) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate clause to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the contracting officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated, or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br /><br />(ii) Each offeror is required to represent, as part of its proposal and to the best of its knowledge that: (A) it is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract; or (B) it has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included the mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii), Mitigation/Waiver, below.<br /><br />(iii) Mitigation/Waiver. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes it can be mitigated, neutralized, or avoided, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the contracting officer for review. At a minimum the offeror should state as a mitigation plan their intent, upon contract award, to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement with each competitor entity. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before government approval of the mitigation plan.<br /><br />(iv) Other Relevant Information. In addition to the mitigation plan, the contracting officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The contracting officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to the Government, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br /><br />(v) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the contracting officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br /><br />(vi) Flow-down. The successful offeror shall insert the substance of the Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in each subcontract tier.</p>
<p>(2) As part of the proposal, the offeror shall provide the contracting officer with complete information of previous or ongoing work that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition.</p>
<p>(b) If award is made to the offeror, the resulting contract may include an organizational conflict of interest limitation applicable to subsequent government work, at either a prime contract level, at any subcontract tier, or both. During evaluation of proposals, the Government may, after discussions with the offeror and consideration of ways to avoid the conflict of interest, insert a special provision in the resulting contract which shall disqualify the offeror from further consideration for award of future contracts.<br /><br />(c) The organizational conflict of interest clause included in this solicitation may be modified or deleted during negotiations.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(k) System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract
<p>DLA Distribution Susquehanna intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to reconfigure an existing towline track located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>SI Systems installed the original towline system, which was built using their specifications. No other company is familiar with the specifications, which are proprietary to SI System. Therefore, the Government intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to SI System to satisfy this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the engineering, design, equipment, tools, labor, and installation to reconfigure an existing towline in building 2001. The contractor shall channel a slot for track (including concrete cutting, chiseling, and concrete application), install track for tow chain, install curve, clean out box and modify existing tow chain to fit application. The design shall consist of redirecting the towline path from the shipping and loading area to bulk storage area. The reconfigure shall require 1 curve section, 1 clean out box, and 2 straight sections connecting to both ends of the curve. The new path shall begin at pole R-30 and travel towards pole R-29. Length of the straight sections is at the contractor discretion but shall be applicable to the operation. As with all curve sections in the Tow Line, a clean out box shall be installed before start of the curve entrance. The existing tow line chain shall be reconnected to fit the modified version of the tow line track.</p>
<p>After installation completion, the Contractor shall test for operation, including start-up, visually checking for binding at newly installed track, and cart travel. Carts shall operate smoothly through newly installed straight sections and curve with no binding, track disengagement, jamming or chain dislodging from track.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or any provision of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor shall warranty for a period of one year after final acceptance by the Government of the systems furnished and installed under this contract that the system will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. During the warranty period and in the event the Contractor is not able to make remedial action himself; he shall make arrangements to have the work accomplished. The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer the name and address of the selected individual and/or firm who can arrive at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, PA within 48 hours after notification of equipment breakdown to perform the necessary repairs.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811310 with a small business size standard of $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company by MONDAY, JANUARY 16, 2015 at 3:30 PM EST to Julie Metzger, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg. 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-6243, Fax: 717-770-7951, or email: Julie.metzger@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to SI Systems.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Please do not take ANY exceptions to the RFQ. If you do not provide the information and documentation requested in this RFQ and/or if you take any exceptions to the RFQ, your quote will be considered non-responsive and may NOT be considered.  <p> NOTE: Item No. 1 is for use with Item Nos. 2 thru 10.

All items required to be manufactured by Flexim.  The Flexim portable clamp-on gas flow meters and transducers (above Item No.s 1-4) are required as they are portable (easily assembled and disassembled in multiple locations); and are the clamp-on, non-intrusive style (does not interfere with gas flow path).	The required Flexim products also have unique specifications that other name brand products do not have:  they utilize both lamb and shear wave ultrasonic flow measurement technology which allows for the required bi-directional flow measurement (with no reduction in accuracy or precision) of gaseous nitrogen, gaseous helium, and gaseous oxygen through ANSI Pipe Schedule XX thick wall pipe.  This bi-directional flow measurement capability with all mentioned gases (nitrogen, helium, and oxygen) with the ability to measure through ANSI Pipe Schedule XX thick wall pipe are all requirements of NASA as to the required products.  There are no other known manufacturers of portable clamp-on gas flow meters and transducers that offer products that meet all the above mentioned features/specifications other than Flexim.  In addition, the required products must be fully compatible with NASA, KSCs existing National Instruments (NI) LabVIEW software currently in use in NASAs existing NI data acquisition systems; and once assembled all required products must be fully compatible for spares for use interchangeably with NASAs existing Flexim portable clamp-on gas flow meters and transducer assemblies that have identical specifications as the required Flexim products.  There are no other known manufacturers that offer products that meet all of the above mentioned requirements as to compatibility with existing software, systems, and assemblies.  The products in above Item No.s 5-10 are supplies to be used with the Flexim manufactured portable clamp-on gas flow meters and transducers (above Item No.s 1-4) and are also required to be manufactured by Flexim.  <p> This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  <p> The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334514 and 500 employees respectively.  The Offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. <p> Delivery to NASA, Kennedy Space Center, Florida  32899 is required within 7 weeks ARO.	 <p> Delivery shall be FOB Destination. <p> The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-78. <p> NOTE:  Offerors shall provide the information required by FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, which is incorporated by reference.	 <p> If the end product(s) offered is other than domestic end product(s) as defined in the clause entitled "Buy American Act -- Supplies," the offeror shall so state and shall list the country of origin. <p> Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Statement of Work Parking Lease (200 and 201 Spaces)

1.0	Overview
1.1The Phoenix VA Health Care System (PVAHCS) is looking to lease parking spaces to support the current and projected growth of patient care within the facility. A recent parking analysis indicated that PVHCS has a deficit of over 500 parking spaces. PVHCS has requested and been approved to construct a parking facility that will temporarily eliminate 100 parking spaces at the main facility. To combat this shortage of parking, the facility is looking for two separate properties with 200 and 201 parking spaces within 2 miles of the main facility located at 650 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85012-1892. 

2.0 Description of work to be performed
2.1 The contractor will provide a vacant property that may be used to park vehicles. The space should be able to provide parking for a minimum of 201 vehicles. Based on a typical parking space of 9' x 20' per space, the net parking area is 36,000 SF. Using an estimated configuration for the parking area, a gross area load factor of 55% is applied to the net area, indicating that the gross area of the property should be approximately 75,600 SF to accommodate the necessary parking. 
2.2 The space is required to have a maximum cross slope of 2% (2' elevation change over a 100' span) to ensure accessibility for disabled users. The space must also be assured of positive rainfall drainage, ensuring that no standing water will accumulate in the parking area. 
2.3 The space must also be capable of being modified by the lease tenant to enable clear parking designation, ensure safe pedestrian movement, and ensure safety for entering and exiting the property. The lease tenant shall be permitted to modify the property by providing asphalt coverage, curbing, paint striping and other safety/traffic control parameters, as necessary. The property owner shall determine at the onset of the lease if restoration to original condition by the lease tenant will be required upon termination of the lease. 
2.4 Patients, employees, contractors, visitors, etc. of PVAHCS will be the only individuals permitted to park in the designated space. 
2.5 Space will be readily available 24 hours daily, 7 days a week, or Monday through Friday 6:00am -6:00pm. (Please see below Instructions to Offerors- Factor 1; Sub-factor 3, for details)
2.6 Provisions will need to be included to accommodate shuttle services to and from the property. These provisions will include space for up to four designated pick-up points, space for signage guiding individuals to the pick-up points, and space for a covered waiting area at each pick-up point to accommodate shuttle riders in the case of inclement weather. The VA will provide the signage and covered bench for seating.

3.0 Location of work
3.1 The space offered shall be located within close proximity (2 mile radius from 7th Street and Indian School Road) to the PVAHCS main campus.
 

South of:  Bethany Home Road
North of:  McDowell Road
East of: N. 19th Avenue
West of: N. 24th Street

4.0 Period of performance
4.1 Five (5) years firm with termination rights, in whole or in part at any time by giving at least ninety (90) days written notice to the Lessor for any reason, or no reason whatsoever. The effective date of such termination shall be the first calendar day occurring after such ninety (90) days.  If this contract is terminated, the Government shall be liable for rent payments due and owing to the Lessor prior to, but not including, the effective date of termination, and any unpaid tenant improvement costs identified in the Lease.

5.0 Any special requirements (e.g. security clearances, travel, special knowledge)
5.1 PVAHCS will provide adequate security and will be allowed access to monitor the leased area. Lessor will furnish a controlled space to facilitate and maintain the security of the parked vehicles.  Lessor will not be responsible for damage theft or vandalism of automobiles.
5.2 No deviations will be accepted.

Statement of Work Parking Lease (200 and 201 Spaces)

1.0	Overview
1.1The Phoenix VA Health Care System (PVAHCS) is looking to lease parking spaces to support the current and projected growth of patient care within the facility. A recent parking analysis indicated that PVHCS has a deficit of over 500 parking spaces. PVHCS has requested and been approved to construct a parking facility that will temporarily eliminate 100 parking spaces at the main facility. To combat this shortage of parking, the facility is looking for two separate properties with 200 and 201 parking spaces within 2 miles of the main facility located at 650 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85012-1892. 

2.0 Description of work to be performed
2.1 The contractor will provide a vacant property that may be used to park vehicles. The space should be able to provide parking for a minimum of 200 vehicles. Based on a typical parking space of 9' x 20' per space, the net parking area is 36,000 SF. Using an estimated configuration for the parking area, a gross area load factor of 55% is applied to the net area, indicating that the gross area of the property should be approximately 75,600 SF to accommodate the necessary parking. 
2.2 The space is required to have a maximum cross slope of 2% (2' elevation change over a 100' span) to ensure accessibility for disabled users. The space must also be assured of positive rainfall drainage, ensuring that no standing water will accumulate in the parking area. 
2.3 The space must also be capable of being modified by the lease tenant to enable clear parking designation, ensure safe pedestrian movement, and ensure safety for entering and exiting the property. The lease tenant shall be permitted to modify the property by providing asphalt coverage, curbing, paint striping and other safety/traffic control parameters, as necessary. The property owner shall determine at the onset of the lease if restoration to original condition by the lease tenant will be required upon termination of the lease. 
2.4 Patients, employees, contractors, visitors, etc. of PVAHCS will be the only individuals permitted to park in the designated space. 
2.5 Space will be readily available 24 hours daily, 7 days a week, or Monday through Friday 6:00am -6:00pm. (Please see below Instructions to Offerors- Factor 1; Sub-factor 3, for details)
2.6 Provisions will need to be included to accommodate shuttle services to and from the property. These provisions will include space for up to four designated pick-up points, space for signage guiding individuals to the pick-up points, and space for a covered waiting area at each pick-up point to accommodate shuttle riders in the case of inclement weather. The VA will provide the signage and covered bench for seating.

3.0 Location of work
3.1 The space offered shall be located within close proximity (2 mile radius from 7th Street and Indian School Road) to the PVAHCS main campus.
 

South of:  Bethany Home Road
North of:  McDowell Road
East of: N. 19th Avenue
West of: N. 24th Street

4.0 Period of performance
4.1 Five (5) years firm with termination rights, in whole or in part at any time by giving at least ninety (90) days written notice to the Lessor for any reason, or no reason whatsoever. The effective date of such termination shall be the first calendar day occurring after such ninety (90) days.  If this contract is terminated, the Government shall be liable for rent payments due and owing to the Lessor prior to, but not including, the effective date of termination, and any unpaid tenant improvement costs identified in the Lease.

5.0 Any special requirements (e.g. security clearances, travel, special knowledge)
5.1 PVAHCS will provide adequate security and will be allowed access to monitor the leased area. Lessor will furnish a controlled space to facilitate and maintain the security of the parked vehicles.  Lessor will not be responsible for damage theft or vandalism of automobiles.
5.2 No deviations will be accepted. 








** Instructions to Offerors**
Evaluation Factors for Award

I. Basis of Award
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation meets or exceeds the requirement at the lowest price.  This award selection will be conducted using the procedures (as specified herein) from the policies and procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.1.  Specifically, FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied.  Award will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Statement of Work for the Request for Proposal.  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price.  The Government reserves the right to refrain from awarding to any contractor in the event that all Offerors progressing beyond the technically acceptable evaluation are determined to have offered pricing that is not considered realistic, reasonable, or complete.  To arrive at an award decision, the Contracting Officer (C.O.) will integrate the Technical Evaluation Board results based on the factors described in the paragraphs that follow.  The factors are the uniform baseline against which each Offeror's proposal is compared, to determine that the offeror will be able to satisfactorily complete the work.  They establish the level an Offeror's proposal must meet in any area, factor, sub-factor, or element in order to be judged acceptable.  To be eligible for award, a proposal must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and include all information required.

The proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the evaluation factors listed below.  The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis.  Only those contractors determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price.  The following areas will be evaluated:

"	Technical - (acceptable/unacceptable)
"	Price - Total price reasonableness and completeness

a.	TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY

Technical Acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  The Technical Evaluation Team will rate the proposals according to the chart listed below:

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)<br />(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This Subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The following questions were asked of the Government relating to the subject requirement which are hereby posted and responded to.
Question and Answer:
Question:	The solicitation states, "The work shall be done by a licensed and National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredited company."

<DESC>Q&A

Q: Our firm received a notice of the release of this contract this Monday and immediately started building a team to submit a proposal.  After digging into the Combined Synopsis / Solicitation we noticed a few irregularities in the procurement notice, most importantly, a lack of information regarding how offerors should submit a price for this IDIQ contract.  There is no price schedule available via FBO nor instructions on how offerors should provide line item pricing otherwise.  Without an answer to this question, our team cannot proceed with committing resources to this effort. 
A: The RFQ list the following information: 
3. COST/PRICE
This Volume shall be organized in such a manner to address and/or provide sufficient details in price breakdown of the quotation. Information must be detailed enough to clearly document that the proposed mix of labor categories, the IDIQ labor category rates, are accurate, realistic, complete and consistent with the proposed technical volume and with the requirements of the PWS. Documentation shall also explain any description of any assumption of terms and conditions as well as a specific description of any pricing and technical assumptions that the response is predicated on.  (All rates are loaded). Provide the escalated rate for the option years (inclusive).
Quotations which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed to show an inherent lack of technical competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements.  This may be grounds for the rejection of the quotation.  The Government may reject any quotation that is unreasonable or materially unbalanced as to prices.  An unbalanced quotation is one that incorporates prices significantly less than cost for some items and/or prices that are significantly overstated for other items.
Also, please provide a price to complete the sample task

Q: My firm is interested in pursuing solicitation number VA101-15-Q-0006 and I was wondering what sort of response is required.  Would you like an SF330 ?  Please clarify.

A: The RFQ list the following information: 
Offerors' quotations will be written submissions and will consist of two volumes.
Volume number	Content	Maximum number of pages
N/A	Cover Letter	2 pages
Volume I a	Technical Approach  	50 pages
Volume I b	Past Performance	10 Pages
Volume II	Solicitation/RFP with completed Schedules of Prices and associated tables; completed fill-ins in Contract Administration Data; Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors	No page limit

?
Q: ****** and I would like to partner on this upcoming IDIQ and we were wondering if we could discuss with you the best way to do this. For example, should we both submit proposals with the other as a subcontractor? Should we submit one proposal with a Teaming Agreement, etc? Or perhaps we should submit multiple proposals with all options.

Can we arrange a phone conversation with you for today or tomorrow?

A: Please contact the Small Business Office 

Q: As an interested and qualified offeror, we respectfully submit the following questions regarding solicitation VA10115Q0006: CHP, ECM and Solar PV Commissioning for your review and response:

1.	Time Extension - due the short timeframe provided (6 business days), we believe that it is reasonable, and in the government's best interest, to extend the due date for submission of proposals by at least 7 business days to allow for the most complete and competitive proposals from qualified SDVOSB offerors.
A: The proposal due date and time will not be extended

2.	Award Structure - it is our understanding that the current submission on the sample PWS will not result in immediate task order awards for those sample tasks or any other tasks, but rather an award on the IDIQ contract, with the minimum stated value of $20,000, and inclusion on subsequent bid requests for all task orders that arise out of the IDIQ. Can you please confirm or deny this position?
A: The sample task is to assist in the selection process. 

3.       Proposal Assumptions - due to the very limited information on the sample projects (overall system output level as the only detail), we understand that all proposed staff, staffing levels and pricing are to be made on significant assumptions about the complexity of the projects (required completion timeline, system layout/site logistics, etc) and subsequently about the complexity of the commissioning and CM tasks listed in the PWS. We request as much detail on the sample projects as possible to help narrow the field assumptions across all offerors to help ensure consistency among proposals which is in the best interest of the government in finding the best value contractors.
A: List all assumptions used and we shall review


Q: I have a question about the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted to FBO under solicitation number VA10115Q0006.

Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity?
A:
1.	DAV energy Solution, VA101(004B)-13-D-0001
2.	Premier Mechanical group VA101(004B)-13-D-0002
3.	Alares, Inc VA101(004B)-13-D-0003

<DESC>Aerial Refueling Drogue - Variable Speed Drogue (VSD)
<p>Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify possible non-developmental sources that may possess the expertise and capabilities to produce a fully developed refueling drogue from build-to-print drawings. The drogue must meet the requirements specified in the Technical Drawing Package (TDP) for Variable Speed Drogue Program. Sample drawings from the TDP are available to interested sources responding to this RFI. The drawings/technical data can only be disseminated pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25. This provides representative illustrations and definition of the types of operations and manufacturing capabilities needed. Review of these drawings will be necessary in order for a potential Offeror to provide a response. The Contracting Officer may only provide this information to qualified U.S. Contractors. Potential Offerors must immediately email to the Contracting officer, katherine.hamblin@us.af.mil and vanessa.pottinger@us.af.mil, the following information:</p>
<p>Offeror Name:<br />Address:<br />Cage Code:<br />Joint Certification Office (JCO) Certification Number*:<br />Certification Expiration Date:<br />Phone:<br />Name of Offeror Representative:<br />Date of Request:</p>
<p>*A potential Offeror without a valid JCO Certification Number must acquire a valid JCO Certification Number before drawings/technical data can be disseminated. Instructions for obtaining this JCO Certification number are found at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/Default.aspx. OFFERORS WITHOUT A VALID JCO CERTIFICATION NUMBER MUST BEGIN THIS PROCESS IMMEDIATELY. Offerors are cautioned that these drawings/technical data are not authorized for duplication and may only be used to prepare a response for this RFI. The drawings/technical data will be secure attachments and offerors must request access through FBO. Once Contracting Officer confirms offeror request, the drawings will become available for viewing.</p>
<p>The complete TDP will be provided with the Request for Proposal (RFP) should an RFP be issued. The TDP would include electronic files in several industry formats for drawings, math models, and model assemblies along with acceptance test procedures. Drawing file formats will consist of: DXF files, PDF files, and PLT files (Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 3.0). Model file formats would consist of: STP files and PRT files (Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 3.0). Model assemblies will be compressed (zipped) folders containing ASM, PRT, WRL, XPR, and IDX files for Pro/ENGINEERING Wildfire 3.0. Acceptance test procedures will be supplied in PDF and MS Word format.</p>
<p>The total requirement may be for the production and delivery of up to 71 drogues including initial spare parts to support operational use for up to 2 years (quantity to be determined). Initial delivery of six drogues would be required no later than 8 months from the date of contract award, and six drogues each month thereafter until the total production of 71 drogues is completed.<br /><br />Your response must address your company's capability to meet the drogues technical requirements, manufacturing schedule, and production/support capabilities. If after reviewing this information you desire to participate by responding to this RFI, you should provide documentation that supports your company's ability to produce a refueling drogue that meets these requirements. Failure to provide adequate documentation will inhibit the government's assessment of your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are permissible. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for Small Business Purposes is 336413 - Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information for your company, institution, or for any teaming or joint venture partners: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; CAGE Code; Phone Number; E-mail Address; Web Page URL; and Size of business pursuant to (NAICS) Code. Based on the above NAICS Code, state whether your company is: Small Business (Yes / No); Woman Owned Small Business (Yes / No); Small Disadvantaged Business (Yes / No); 8(a) Certified (Yes / No); HUBZone Certified (Yes / No); Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes / No); Service Disabled Small Business (Yes / No); System for Award Management (SAM) (Yes / No). Include a statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).</p>
<p>Response to this notice shall consist of a short (10 pages or less) initial White Paper response describing your ability to produce the design in the TDP. The White Paper shall include the following details: (1) General statement of your company's capability and capacity to build the VSD and in the number requested; (2) Brief explanation of your experience in building similar complex build-to-print products; (3) Estimated production cost for each drogue; (4) Approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Response should be in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Windows and Office 2010. The data can be submitted on CD-R/DVD-R along with a paper copy. The CD should be provided to Ms. Katherine Hamblin at the address below not later than 30 Jan 2015. Questions should be submitted to Ms. Katherine Hamblin at katherine.hamblin@us.af.mil and Capt Vanessa Pottinger at vanessa.pottinger@us.af.mil. The CD/DVD, cover label, and paper copy shall be marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information." Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from disclosure. No classified information should be included in contractor submittals.</p>

This notice is issued for market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or commitment to issue an RFP; however, the Government reserves the right to issue a solicitation based upon its needs and the results obtained from this RFI.

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard.

<p>TITLE: Innovative Cross-domain Cyber Reactive Information Sharing (ICCyRIS)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-02</p>
<p>CFDA NUMBER: 12.800</p>
<p>I. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION</span>:</p>
<p>The Cross Domain Innovation &amp; Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate is interested in new innovative technologies and capabilities, within the Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Cyber Security environments, that promote the state of the art for secure, accreditable resilient and reactive capabilities to enhance the sharing of information between multiple security domains within both enterprise and mobile/tactical environments.</p>
<p>This BAA focuses on developing new technologies to allow secure data sharing; trusted computing; smart routing; cyber defense; Multi-Level Security (MLS) trust at the tactical edge; and a comprehensive, multi-security domain, user-defined operational picture to effectively and efficiently improve the state-of-the-art for defense enterprise, cloud, and mobile/tactical computing/operations.</p>
<p>The goals of this BAA are to improve cross-domain information sharing in five distinct technology areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Multi-Enclave/Multi-Domain Cyber User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) - Extending enterprise status monitoring efforts and Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) adaptability to meet greater operator need.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. High Risk Data Type Mitigation - Providing micro-virtualized ultra-high-risk content and investigations for malicious behavior before passing them to other security domains.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Fine-Grained Grammar for Orchestration - Use of formal grammars for quick adaptation of workflows to meet changing mission/security/performance requirements.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Content and Label Based Routing - Extending the trust provided at node and network environments to the information objects being passed to assure end-to-end trust in passing and delivering information to recipients.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. MLS Trust at the Edge - Extending the robustness and usability of MLS mobile and desktop endpoint technology to meet the critical needs of our mobile warriors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Automatically Evaluate Video Streams for Cross-Domain Releasability:</strong> Perform an analysis of alternatives and incorporate the most mature systems into a prototype for evaluating the releasability of streaming data. This specifically includes but is not limited to speech-to-text, person recognition, and object recognition functionality plus system(s) to reason over the results of these functions.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Security Through Virtualization:</strong> Utilize the broad swath of virtualization technologies to improve the state of the art of information assurance. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY 15 under this BAA, as well as the Secure Data Containers Focus Area for FY16.</p>
<p><strong>Novel, Trustworthy Filtration:</strong> Improve the state of data filtration through the use of techniques and procedures either previously unexplored in filtration or completely novel. Note that adding a new filter for an already covered file type is much less interesting than the ability to add classes of file types which are otherwise unaddressed by filtration engines. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY15 under this BAA, as well as the Imagery to Text Focus Area for FY18.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Orchestration Interfaces that don't require a "Man-in-the-Loop":</strong> Research and develop better automation of multiple data flows, each containing myriad functions and decision points, intended to affect large pools of data. This may be used in conjunction with various efforts such as the National Security Agency's (NSA's) Bray tool, Data Flow Configuration Format (DFCF), Guard Remote Management Protocol (GRMP), the CDS Management Information Base (MIB), and/or others. This capability includes the ability to demonstrate proposed changes against known pools of data, provide high level metrics regarding the original and changed results on those known pools of data, and to allow the user to drill down into greater, granular detail on the metrics as needed. These interfaces should not assume any particular degree of knowledge for users beyond a general computer use competency, and must ensure users' identity and authorization via appropriate methods.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Machine-to-Machine Automation:</strong> Many cross domain links are established between automated systems for various purposes. There are large swaths of commonality across most of these links. Build tools to leverage unmodified CDSs from the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) baseline to better meet the need for creating similar links in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Commodity Multi-Level Security (MLS) Networking:</strong> Create networking capable of mandatory access control (MAC) for content, locations and users marked, approved and operating at different levels of classification (plus releasability, caveats, and other security-relevant markings) utilizing commodity hardware, operating systems, software and infrastructure as much as practical. Complete redevelopment/replacement of existing networking infrastructure and endpoints is explicitly outside the scope of this effort.</p>
<p><strong>CAC Authentication via MicroSD Certificate Storage:</strong> Commercial mobile devices on their own, with standard configuration, are not secure enough for government use. However, to save money, many agencies are looking to leverage them. This poses a challenge for securing government/sensitive data access by the device user, while maintaining all the functionality of the commercial device itself. One approach is to utilize micro/nano Secure Digital (SD) cards to provide secure storage of access certificates. Phase one of this focus area will develop a secure, "read only" certificate store utilizing the Micro and Nano SD card form factors for use in physically unmodified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Platforms. Software applications may be modified or created in order to demonstrate the functionality. The second phase of this focus area will test the proposed solution against real world scenarios utilizing life-like certificate data to ascertain robustness against published Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGS).</p>
<p><strong>Securing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Device Common Access Card (CAC) Authentication via Near-Field Communication (NFC):</strong> Several COTS mobile devices feature NFC capabilities. Concurrently, there are requirements for warfighters to authenticate on computing resources with their Common Access Card (CAC). Unfortunately, physical external readers for CACs are unwieldy extensions to mobile devices. As such, there may be an opportunity to investigate utilizing the COTS NFC capabilities assuming they meet or exceed the security requirements accomplished by the physical readers. Given the repeated demonstrations given at most modern Black Hat events exploiting COTS NFC capabilities in many various ways, skepticism as to these devices' security capabilities will need to be assuaged and demonstrated as mitigated appropriately for operationally meaningful situations. Additionally, the demonstrated solution has additional challenges: It must be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data provided via CAC PKI capabilities, it must securely account for users with multiple credentials and access their existing certificates within appropriate networks (as in Global Access List, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)/ Active Directory (AD), etc.), must have a segregation capability if malicious code is detected, and allow for appropriate persistence of user authentication even after the device and NFC tag are outside of scanning range.</p>
<p><strong>Real Time Mobile Authentication:</strong> Many mobile users, especially field operators and tactical users, require mobile devices to be unlocked or readily available at any time throughout the mission. Long passphrases can be difficult to remember and may require attention that directs their vision away from the battlefield. Unfortunately, leaving the devices unlocked poses a large security risk if the phones are lost or stolen. By leveraging the sensors on the device (ex. Camera, GPS, Accelerometer (Gate), Humidity, Temperature) along with new wearable technology (Blood pressure, Heart Beat, Body Temp) advanced policies can be created to authenticate the user with the mobile device and keep mission critical applications unlocked and ready to use. These policies should be dynamic and adapt to the environment of the user. For example, complete operations such as locking the device or in certain locations wiping the device entirely. The measures of effectiveness will measure will be measured on authentication false positive/negative rates, impacts to battery life, CPU performance, I/O performance and tactical use-cases.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY15:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>High Risk Binary Assessment:</strong> Demonstrate a capability to automate invocation of potentially malicious content within a secure environment (such as a sandbox, virtual machine, or &lsquo;detonation chamber'). This capability should include scripting some appropriate number of user actions within commodity, unmodified applications and monitoring the environment for malicious or unexpected behaviors. The solution should incorporate both signature based detection of suspect behaviors as well as aberrant behavior based on a learned fingerprint of the normal functioning of the consuming application(s) within the environment. For example, if a given application doesn't normally generate alternate data streams within Windows, then generating an alternate data steam upon opening a new file in that application should be flagged. Integrity of the mechanisms that identify these unexpected behaviors must be protected from tampering or observation from within the secure environment. The solution shall also include one or more ways to adapt to new exercising applications and steps within the secure environment to either extend inspection of current file types supported and/or to offer support for new file types. In the final version delivered, no particular degree of knowledge beyond a general computer use competency should be expected from operators or those who adapt the system in the aforementioned manner(s).</p>
<p><strong>Situational Awareness of End-to-End Multi-level Information Flow:</strong> NSA's Cross Domain Solution Management Information Base (CDS-MIB) is a CDS-independent mechanism used to report including flow performance, errors, and other various metrics related to CDS health and status. This is only part of the picture that is necessary to efficiently be aware of the true multi-level information flow picture. The addition of information pertaining to CDS support devices such as external filtering appliances, CDS pre-processors, mission applications that leverage CDS and other IT integral to cross domain services (e.g., identity management, email infrastructure) is intended to enhance end-to-end situational awareness. This will increase situation awareness of all CDSs on the network, provide more insight into network status and services status, and provide opportunity for further integration with other activities, to include prior CDIS run efforts such as Audit-Based Sensing &amp; Protection (ASP) and Behavior Based Risk Assurance (BBRA). Once this capability is developed, other capabilities can use the information to include load balancers and automatic failover.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Mobile Device Management (DMDM):</strong> In order to provide secure containers for multiple compartments within mobile devices, a dynamic method to manage mobile devices using a secure Operating System (such as SE-Android) is required. This topic is to develop and demonstrate an innovative method for the management of such a device. This following management capabilities must be considered : support for multiple compartments on a single mobile platform, dividing each container into separate compartments, each with their own storage, keystore, and applications; the ability to provide flexible policies for the communication of all applications with each other and the device; provide high-level enforcement of applications to operate as specified by policy within a container; provide typical device management which includes: user management, device lock-down, container isolation protection, tamper resistance, and remote management (including the ability to wipe the device if compromised); provide continual assessment of the devices security state and make appropriate actions when that state is compromised. The prototype delivered must incorporate as many of these capabilities as possible and demonstrate successful container separation, device and policy management, and attestation of device security.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 16:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Multi-Level-Security Mobile Secure Foundation:</strong> Currently we are tracking two major technical approaches for Multi-Level Security (MLS) on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware running the Android ecosystem. The first approach utilizes a hypervisor to separate multiple virtual machines' operations within the secure device. The second utilizes Security Enhanced (SE) Android policy to separate (sets of) processes. Both of these efforts have disparate strengths and weaknesses, as measured by performance, battery life, boot and access times, and other metrics. Other technical approaches to achieve assured Multi Level Security operation within the Android ecosystem may also be viable, if they can be brought to a similar or higher degree of maturity as well as accomplishing the rest of the tasking by the end of this effort. This effort is to provide a secure foundation for additional development in mobile devices for multiple DoD/IC use cases. As such, the solution chosen must follow accreditation guidelines throughout the effort and ideally have zero outstanding technical issues which would preclude accreditation. Additionally, the chosen solution must adhere to the relevant portions of the Mobility Capability Package protection profiles and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) guidelines. The architecture shall include components selected from the National Security Agency Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) such as Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Mobile Device Management, etc. Finally, it is important that the solution be compatible with military needs for current and future tactical usage, including the continued usage of hardware peripherals. The successful solution will be based on commodity hardware, and ideally with commodity firmware utilizing hardware-based attestation (e.g. Trusted Platform Module (TPM), ARM TrustZone, Samsung KNOX, etc.) through the boot cycle and normal operation of the device. Solutions featuring custom operating systems and firmware are not ideal as they are expected to have higher procurement and maintenance costs and requirements, among other reasons. Measures of effectiveness will include the ability to integrate with existing technologies and abide by all of current and future NSA Mobility publications. The solution shall also adhere to strict requirements of battery life, CPU performance, I/O performance, boot-up times, and tactical application integration.</p>
<p><strong>CDS High Availability:</strong> Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) are typically less resilient than our other information technology (IT). Today we can support CDS load balancing and failover via typical mechanisms if the CDS protocols support it. There are, however, multiple technical shortfalls that limit the usability of these techniques, including the inability to: provide CDS load information to commodity load balancers, maintain configuration synchronization between multiple CDS and the ability to detect and recover from CDS failure. The purpose of this effort is to develop techniques to address these CDS availability concerns. Measures of effectiveness will include extensibility of approach to multiple CDS, ability to integrate with off-the-shelf tools for load balancing, information assurance acceptability and efficient utilization of network bandwidth for communication between components.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Domain Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Mediation Layer:</strong> A common approach to addressing cross domain information sharing requirements is cross-domain enablement of the underlying information technology (IT) that facilitates information sharing intra domain. Cross domain enablement of the machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols that support this IT is challenging because M2M protocols often have attributes that do not match typical CDS transfer characteristics. Some common examples include: non-atomic transactions (require more than one CDS transfer in order to complete), transactions that require ACK/NACK (CDS transfers are usually one way and may not provide failure notification) and transactions that are dependent upon one another (CDS are typically stateless and transfers are independent of one another). The purpose of this effort is to develop a mediation layer that can act as a foundation for M2M communications over a CDS. This mediation layer will be the integration point for specific protocol termination services (e.g. - DB transactions, Web Services) and would handle the necessary information management and CDS data flow understanding to map between M2M interface requirements and CDS transfer capabilities. Measures of effectiveness will include ease of integration with a new set of M2M data flows, native M2M protocol independence, ability to protect end system data integrity from CDS filtering issues, solution performance (throughput and latency) and ease of recovery when issues arise (e.g. - CDS is unavailable, CDS filters misconfigured and start failing transactions).</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Mobile Device Management (DMDM):</strong> In order to provide secure containers for multiple compartments within mobile devices, a dynamic method to manage mobile devices using a secure Operating System (such as SE-Android) is required. This topic is to develop and demonstrate an innovative method for the management of such a device. This following management capabilities must be considered: support for multiple compartments on a single mobile platform, dividing each container into separate compartments, each with their own storage, key store, and applications; the ability to provide flexible policies for the communication of all applications with each other and the device; provide high-level enforcement of applications to operate as specified by policy within a container; provide typical device management which includes: user management, device lock-down, container isolation protection, tamper resistance, and remote management (including the ability to wipe the device if compromised); provide continual assessment of the devices security state and make appropriate actions when that state is compromised. The prototype delivered must incorporate as many of these capabilities as possible and demonstrate successful container separation, device and policy management, and attestation of device security. The solution must adhere to the relevant portions of the Mobility Capability Package protection profiles and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) guidelines. The measures of effectiveness will be measured on application performance, agility to tactical low-no communication situations and the ability to integrate with components from the National Security Agency Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) such as Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Mobile Device Management, etc.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 17:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>On-Demand Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Filtering:</strong> Provide a trustworthy mechanism to securely store, deliver, and deploy new filters into CDSs on demand. The intent is to develop a new or extend an existing agnostic Application Programmer's Interface (API) to allow multiple disparate transfer CDSs to interrogate one or more trusted store(s) for filters to be secure delivered in near-real-time, and to provide a reference implementation for that trusted store. This is intended to allow CDSs to adapt to changing workload requirements and threat environments. If the CDS already contains a similar capability or partial capability, it is expected that this API will wrapper them rather than redeveloping.</p>
<p><strong>Enhance Logic and Visualization for Enterprise Capabilities:</strong> Extend the ability to monitor one or more transfer Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) beyond prior efforts' scope by incorporating business logic through a reasoning engine to examine the data collected and stored via CDS-MIB, SNMP &amp; perhaps alternate sources as well as performing trend analysis across this information. This would be expected to be able to automatically suggest and/or enforce reporting and warning thresholds to alert responsible parties via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (for integration with enterprise management &amp; alert systems), email and/or text to abnormal activity with respect to the CDSs' normal functioning. Given other previously developed tools, this developed capability might be expected to automatically react to incoming data and alter one or more CDSs' operational posture, either to ensure operational goals and/or reduce data exfiltration/malware infiltration.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile MLS Cross Domain XML Routing:</strong> Evaluate existing XML data tagging standards for use in both IP-based wired networks and wireless mobile networking environments, both for traditional tagging roles and also in support of cross security domain routing decisions. Publish this evaluation in order to gather feedback and consensus and hopefully drive standardization across DoD/IC and eventually the mobile industry. Finally, develop a prototype that enables standardized cross domain routing originating and/or ending on a mobile platform.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced File Typing:</strong> Perform best of breed Analysis of Alternatives between deep content inspection and/or file parsing capabilities such as Apache Tika, Data Format Description Language (DFDL), and similar. Using the best of breed, create a prototype to perform deep content inspection of files to detect and/or extract metadata, binary blobs and/or structured text content to properly &amp; fully identify file types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) types). Develop with common programmatic API calls plus appropriate web service interfaces and NSA's Filter Componentization Effort (FCE) specification. Test and evaluate performance and reliability of file type identification. Include edge cases such as polymorphism, spoofing, multiple file type compatibilities, and container file types.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 18:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagery to Text:</strong> In order to better meet warfighter operational needs, perform an Analysis of Alternatives on commercial, open source and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) tools which provide Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and related capabilities. Include analysis on cost, performance, hardware requirements, accuracy (false positive / false negative rates), and other relevant features. Use the highest rated alternative to generate raw text files from multiple (3+) disparate imagery file and/or streaming formats. Create interfaces to feed output to other processes such as the Filter Componentization Effort (FCE) specification among other relevant specifications. Ensure the product provides appropriate levels of auditing and meets relevant assurance requirements.</p>

<p>ATTN: Michael J. Mayhew <br />AFRL/RIEBA<br />ICCyRIS BAA: <strong>BAA-RIK-14-02<br /></strong>525 Brooks Road<br />Rome, NY 13441-4505</p>
<p>Electronic submission to <a href="mailto:Michael.Mayhew.1@us.af.mil">Michael.Mayhew.1@us.af.mil</a> will also be accepted.</p>
<p>In the event of a possible or actual compromise of classified information in the submission of your white paper or proposal, immediately but no later than 24 hours, bring this to the attention of your cognizant security authority and AFRL Rome Research Site Information Protection Office (IPO):</p>
<p>Vincent Guza<br />315-330-4048 0730-1630 Monday-Friday<br />315-330-2961 Evenings and Weekends<br />Email: <a href="mailto:vincent.guza@us.af.mil">vincent.guza@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>V. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) <strong>Overall Scientific and Technical Merit</strong> -- Including the degree of innovation for the approach and the use of innovative modern architectures in development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; the use of analysis, metrics &amp; testing and adherence to Information Assurance and Cross-Domain best practices, (2) <strong>Related Experience</strong> - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and experience within cross-domain environments, (3) <strong>Openness, Maturity &amp; Assurance of Solution</strong> - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of degree of Information Assurance and Cross-Domain standards implemented, and (4) <strong>Reasonableness and Realism</strong> of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret or Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret or Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>

<DESC>The following is an amendment to the&nbsp;original sources sought, issued January 6, 2015. Several edits have been made, particulalrly under Section 2 Objectives. This section now describes in a general way the types of work products which should be expected to be delivered should a contract(s) be awarded as a result of a future solicitation. The remaining changes are primarily&nbsp;minor edits.&nbsp;The revised version follows: <br /><br />This sources sought is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any further contract actions, i.e., solicitation and/ or contract. Respondents are advised that the United States Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this sources sought. Not responding does not preclude participation in any future RFP that may be issued. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract.<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) / Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting market research to determine if there are any small business concerns capable of performing the FHWA Office of Operations (HOP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract activities, deliverables, and other tasks required by the IDIQ. Contractors will need to show the ability to perform the objectives identified herein, both individually and concurrently.<br /><br />1 Scope<br />The contractor shall provide support to the U.S. DOT by working with the HOP on various task orders in the following program areas:
<p>&bull; Accelerating Implementation of Operations &amp; ITS Technologies and Strategies<br />The goal of accelerating the implementation of operations and integrated Information Technology Services technologies and strategies is to ensure effective and successful development, implementation, and use of technologies &amp; strategies by transportation agencies in managing their transportation facilities. A major element of accelerating deployment is the active engagement of FHWA division offices in identifying workshops, peer exchanges, and other resources that have been and may be successful in implementing operations strategies in transportation agencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Operations and Freight Performance Measurement and Management<br />Performance measurement is the use of evidence to determine progress toward specific defined organizational objectives. This includes both quantitative evidence (e.g., travel time measurements) and qualitative evidence (e.g., customer satisfaction and customer perceptions). Operations performance programs measure progress toward meeting the objectives of transportation system management and operations. Although the specific objectives of management and operations activities vary among organizations, most relate to the overall goals of transportation mobility, productivity, and safety. The HOP is leading numerous activities to advance the implementation and practice of operations performance measurement at the Federal, State, and local level. Freight-specific performance measures help to identify needed transportation improvements and monitor their effectiveness for goods movement, and they also serve as indicators of economic health and traffic congestion.<br />&emsp;<br />&bull; Organizing and Planning for Operations<br /><br />To meet the challenge of reducing congestion and improving operations, transportation agencies require tools to evaluate their current organizational capabilities, and plans for when &amp; how to successfully implement process improvements. Evaluating capabilities and making essential improvements to traffic operations and business processes moves an agency closer to organizational excellence, enabling them to successfully plan and execute operations programs that effectively manage transportation and reduce congestion. Planning for operations was developed to promote multimodal planning practices that support 21st century transportation system management and operations. In order to link 21st Century operational services into the transportation planning and programming process, transportation planners and operators should have a common understanding of the mobility, safety, and efficiency benefits of linking planning and operations.</p>
<p>Planning for Operations includes three important aspects:<br /><br />&bull; Regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination activity that facilitates Regional Transportation Systems Management and Operations,<br />&bull; Management and operations considerations within the context of the ongoing regional transportation planning and investment process, and <br />&bull; The opportunities for linkage between regional operations collaboration and regional planning.</p>
<p>Linking planning and operations is vital to improving transportation decisionmaking and the overall effectiveness of transportation systems. Coordination between planners and operators helps ensure that regional transportation investment decisions reflect full consideration of all available strategies and approaches to meet regional goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Analysis Tools<br /><br />Through the FHWA Traffic Analysis Tools Program, our partners and customers will expand their use of analysis tools and innovative analysis approaches that consider a system-level approach and will enhance mobility. They will gain insight on recommended/best practices and lessons learned in operational analysis. They will gain a high level of confidence in utilizing the analysis tools for their local needs. The Traffic Analysis Tools Program attempts to strike a balance between efforts to develop new, improved tools in support of traffic operations analysis and efforts to facilitate the deployment and use of existing tools. The FHWA has established two tracks under the Traffic Analysis Tools Program: the deployment track and the development track. The deployment track concentrates on the needs and concerns of the traffic analysis stakeholder community. The development track focuses on enhancing and developing models that are easier to use, more robust in their application, and more reliable in their results.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Control (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD))<br /><br />The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) defines the standards used by road managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic control devices on all public streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to public travel. The MUTCD is published by the FHWA under 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 655, Subpart F. The MUTCD, which has been administered by the FHWA since 1971, is a compilation of national standards for all traffic control devices, including road markings, highway signs, and traffic signals. It is updated periodically to accommodate the nation's changing transportation needs and address new safety technologies, traffic control tools and traffic management techniques.</p>
<p>&bull; Active Transportation and Demand Management<br /><br />Active Transportation and Demand Management (ATDM) is the dynamic management, control, and influence of travel demand, traffic demand, and traffic flow of transportation facilities. Through the use of available tools and assets, traffic flow is managed and traveler behavior is influenced in real-time to achieve operational objectives, such as preventing or delaying breakdown conditions, improving safety, promoting sustainable travel modes, reducing emissions, or maximizing system efficiency. Through ATDM, regions attain the capability to monitor, control, and influence travel, traffic, and facility demand of the entire transportation system and over a traveler's entire trip chain. This notion of dynamically managing across the trip chain is the ultimate vision of ATDM. The ATDM program is intended to support agencies and regions considering moving towards an active management approach. Through customized workshops, tools, guidance documents, resources, and peer exchanges, the program can assist with technical support to implement ATDM strategies. Importantly, ATDM is not an exclusive program restricted to specific agencies. Every agency that is considering moving towards active and dynamic capabilities can benefit from the ATDM program's efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Arterial Management / Traffic Signal Operations<br /><br />Arterial roadways are a crucial link in the national transportation system that provides regional mobility and access to land use that is vital to our economy and quality of life. Arterials account for more than one million lane miles of roadway, connecting local and collector roads to the national highway systems. Over 3000 State and local agencies are responsible for the management and operation of the estimated 311,000 traffic signals that are spread across urban, suburban and rural communities throughout the United States. The objective of the Arterial Management Program is to advance management practices and operations strategies that promote the safe and efficient use of arterial roadway capacity to reduce congestion.</p>
<p>&bull; Congestion Pricing<br /><br />Congestion pricing (or value pricing) is a way of harnessing the power of the market to reduce the waste associated with traffic congestion. Congestion pricing recognizes that trips have different values at different times and places and for different individuals. Faced with premium charges during periods of peak demand, road users are encouraged to eliminate lower-valued trips, take them at a different time, or choose alternative routes or transport modes where available. In cases where congestion pricing is applied to specific traffic lanes rather than to an entire highway facility, users have the option of choosing to pay to use congestion-free priced lanes or continue to travel on general purpose lanes without paying a toll. There is a consensus among economists that congestion pricing represents the single most viable and sustainable approach to reducing traffic congestion. The Congestion Pricing program provides information and resources to help equip State agencies and practitioners with an understanding and tools to implement congestion pricing projects and incorporate pricing into transportation planning.</p>
<p>&bull; Real-Time Transportation Information<br /><br />Real-Time Transportation Information focuses on information for all sorts of travel on the nation's surface transportation networks - how the information is collected, how it's processed, how it's provided to consumers, and how it may be used by transportation system operators to improve travel for everyone. Additionally, real-time transportation system information is shared to improve the security of the surface transportation system, to address congestion problems, to support improved response to weather events and surface transportation incidents, and to facilitate national &amp; regional traveler information.</p>
<p>&bull; Road Weather Management<br /><br />Adverse weather conditions have a major impact on the safety and operation of our Nation's roads, from signalized arterials to Interstate highways. Weather affects driver behavior, vehicle performance, pavement friction, and roadway infrastructure. Weather events and their impacts on roads can be viewed as predictable, non-recurring incidents that affect safety, mobility and productivity. The Road Weather Management Program, within the FHWA Office of Operations, seeks to better understand the impacts of weather on roadways, and promote strategies and tools to mitigate those impacts. Envisioned is a system that provides "Anytime, Anywhere Road Weather Information" for road users and road operating agencies, as well as a robust, competitive market for road weather services.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Incident and Events Management<br /><br />Traffic Incident Management (TIM) consists of a planned and coordinated multi-disciplinary process to detect, respond to, and clear traffic incidents so that traffic flow may be restored as safely and quickly as possible. Effective TIM reduces the duration and impacts of traffic incidents and improves the safety of motorists, crash victims and emergency responders. The TIM Program of the FHWA is part of a larger all-hazards program called Emergency Transportation Operations (ETO). Effective TIM is a coordinated process that involves a number of public and private sector partners, including: Law Enforcement, Fire and Rescue, Emergency Medical Services, Transportation, Public Safety Communications, Emergency Management, Towing and Recovery, Hazardous Materials Contractors, and Traffic Information Media.<br /><br />&bull; Work Zone Mobility and Safety<br /><br />The FHWA Work Zone Management Program is working to "make work zones work better" by providing transportation practitioners with high-quality products, tools, and information that can be of value in planning, designing, and implementing safer, more efficient, and less congested work zones. These resources include:<br /><br />&bull; Comprehensive information and guidance for implementing the Work Zone Safety and Mobility Rule (23 CFR 630 Subpart J).<br />&bull; Peer-to-Peer Program that provides State and Local transportation agencies easy access to knowledgeable peers across a range of work zone issues, at no cost to these agencies.<br />&bull; Work zone training courses, to help practitioners plan, design, and implement safe and effective work zones.<br />&bull; Publications and studies on a variety of work zone topics, including work zone ITS, traffic analysis tools for work zones, contracting methods, construction strategies, public information and outreach for work zones, and others.</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial Vehicle Size and Weight</p>
<p>The Freight Office, in coordination with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) oversees the U.S. DOT's commercial vehicle size and weight activities. The Freight Office ensures the federal regulations governing commercial vehicle size and weight are appropriately enforced by the states, primarily through making sure each state has a commercial vehicle size and weight program. The office also works to implement initiatives that promote improved oversize commercial vehicle movements, such as Pilot Car Escort Vehicle training workshops.</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Data and Analysis</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts much of the freight transportation data analysis conducted by the DOT. The analysis includes the creation and maintenance of the Freight Analysis Framework (FAF), which spatially maps freight transportation flows within the U.S. and entering the U.S. It also includes analysis on freight transportation performance measures, to evaluate freight flow efficiency on the U.S. transportation network. Finally, the Freight Office examines commercial truck parking data, and works with public and private sector providers to improve truck parking information availability.</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Operations and Technology</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts various activities that work to enhance freight transportation efficiency through improved transportation operations. These activities include the implementation and promotion of the Freight Advanced Traveler Information System (FRATIS), which utilizes both private shipper and carrier freight shipment information and public sector traveler information to optimize freight flows and minimize the number of empty truck movements. They also include various technologies used to support commercial vehicle size and weight enforcement, including weigh-in-motion and the Pavement Damage Assessment Tool (PaveDAT).</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Professional Development</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts various activities with its field offices and indirectly with state Departments of Transportation (State-DOT) and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) to improve public sector freight transportation planning. These activities include promoting and supporting the creation of state freight plans and state freight advisory committees as encouraged in MAP-21, overseeing the Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) program, organizing and holding monthly webinars focused on current and on-going freight issues as part of the Talking Freight webinar series, creating, promoting, and teaching various courses designed to educate professionals about freight transportation needs and issues, and conducting State-DOT and MPO program assessments. The activities also include conducting regular meetings with FHWA field office staff to discuss key freight-related legislation and State-DOT and MPO freight planning needs, and maintaining the internal Freight Discipline SharePoint site to share important freight-related information within the agency. Finally, the Freight Professional Development program includes oversight of the highway and freight-focused portions of the DOT's high visibility Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) discretionary grant program.</p>
<p>Many, though not all, of the HOP activities are currently related to requirements in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), the current surface transportation reauthorization bill. MAP-21 contains many transportation-related provisions and requirements that are being led or carried out by the FHWA Operations. It is expected the contractor shall provide support to the FHWA Operations on MAP-21-related tasks, or when the successor bill to MAP-21 is enacted, the new, surface transportation reauthorization bill that replaces MAP-21.</p>
<p>In addition to the MAP-21 related provisions, the contractor shall provide support to the FHWA Operations on its on-going tasks not tied to the MAP-21 provisions. These tasks include providing staff technical support as needed for the various program areas specified above.</p>
<p>The FHWA Operations programs /initiatives have cross-cutting technologies over other DOT Offices such as the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) ITS Joint Program Office. These technologies help to advance intelligent transportation systems by performing comprehensive transportation statistics research, analysis and reporting; and providing education and training in transportation and transportation-related fields.<br /><br />2 Objectives</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying Legacy Archive Tape Management Services as listed below:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service (FS) is interested in acquiring a service that effectively allows the agency to manage legacy IT information currently residing on archive tapes and stored in multiple third party facilities. It is estimated that the FS has on the order of 100,000+ tapes containing raw, non-deduplicated data, currently housed offsite in these commercial archive centers and other locations. Much of the data on these tapes were archived by the FS using IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (version 5.3) as well as other means. The commercial archive facilities are geographically located in 10 different major city locations around CONUS. Data on these tapes are being held primarily to comply with retention policies and open legal hold orders. Periodically, there is a need to retrieve specific, often narrowly scoped, information that exists only on these tapes. Lotus Notes email is most commonly retrieved. For example, to satisfy Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or legal discovery orders received by the agency. While agency disposition plans for legacy content have been suspended for some time, it is expected that these will resume in the foreseeable future. The FS will need to implement tape destruction practices that meet federal storage media destruction guidelines at that time.</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>The new archive service must resolve several problems the FS is experiencing with its current process. Today the FS relies on maintaining a legacy infrastructure of hardware and software to enable the restoration of content on archive tapes. This legacy infrastructure is not upgradeable and vendor support has gone end-of-life. The outcome of this situation continues to be an unreliable system and an ineffective process for recovering specific information in a timely manner to meet deadlines. The broad geographical distribution of these storage media in multiple facilities no longer serves a purpose and is adding both cost, time, and risk when tapes must be handled and shipped to the legacy system for restoration. In addition, having this storage media dispersed across these locations adds significant complexity to our business and operational management processes involving these facilities. In most cases, our need to acquire and restore legacy information is driven by regulatory or litigation orders, such as FOIA or legal eDiscovery requests. The current process cannot meet the typical delivery time constraints put on such requests. In addition, there remains a significant quantity of legacy content (primarily tapes) not currently held in the commercial facilities mentioned, and need to be relocated. Legal holds involving the agency may require continued preservation of these tapes into the foreseeable future. However, the likelihood of needing to restore and collect information from these sources is very low.</p>
<p>Desired Outcome:</p>
<p>The service sought by the FS would enable an efficient and value added process for storing, retrieving, deleting/destruction, and generally managing the lifecycle of legacy information currently on tape, or other portable, storage media. The service must eliminate the agency's need to maintain legacy IT infrastructure to restore information. The service should also result in shorter delivery times from initial request to receiving the readable, native/original format data from the provider. The ability to cull (eg. search and filter) information prior to delivery is highly desirable to limit FS data ingestion to that which is relevant to the requesting project. Easy management and use of the service, through a simplified account structure and web accessible customer interfaces, is also important. The service must also be scalable to accommodate data volume expansions, or contractions, throughout the life of the service. The service should also provide tiered storage options to accommodate varying data value and access needs for low priority storage media as a means to minimize costs. In summary, the FS is seeking a service that greatly increases our ability to access and manage legacy information while reducing the overall time and cost associated with handling the storage media.</p>
<p>RESPONSES:</p>
<p>Responses are to include the following:<br />a) Name of corporate point of contact, telephone number, full mailing address, e-mail address, CAGE Code, NAICS identifier and any other pertinent information.<br />b) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to providing Legacy Archive Tape Management Services.<br />c) Whether your company's interest in the Legacy Archive Tape Management Services a prime contractor, a subcontractor, or other as specified.<br />d) Describe any key considerations in when considering Legacy Archive Tape Management Services.<br />e) Companies should present their responses in the form of a whitepaper no more than 25 pages in length describing the information requested in this RFI. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the whitepaper. <br />f) Responses shall be in Microsoft WORD <br />g) The format of your response shall be as follows:<br />1. Font size of Times New Roman 12 or a font of similar size and clarity.<br />2. 8.5 X 11 paper with 1 inch margins on all sides.<br />discouraged.<br />h) Companies should submit their response no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on 02/02/14.<br />i) Companies will submit their responses electronically to mdesouto@fs.fed.us, E-mail file sizes shall not exceed 6Mbs.<br />j) Technical questions may be directed to Kevin Hadley khadley@fs.fed.us 406.791.7747 and shall include the Contracting Officer Michael DeSouto mdesouto@fs.fed.us in the Cc block on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service is hosting an Industry Day/RFI for Small Business Radio Communication Shelter Manufactures with the CIO Radio team members, the 8(a) Installation Contractor and for the FY15 Program of Work valued at approximately $2M annually. Participants have the option to attend either in person or by submitting a written response as described below. All Q&amp;A will be posted 5 business days after the Industry Day/RFI.<br />&nbsp;<br />The information provided during this industry day may be used by the Forest Service to best develop its acquisition strategy, Performance work Statement, Salient Characteristics, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. An Industry Day (see below) will be held to provide interested industry parties the current plans for this proposed activity. This will help the Forest Service (FS) develop PWS for the 8(a) Project Coordinator /Installer and Specifications for future Shelter requirements. The FS will look at all the salient characteristics, specifications, and products offered by the small business manufactures in hopes of creating a more competitive environment and thus competitive pricing (cost saving) with a high quality product solution. This will potentially result in multiple contract awards to the best value small business Communication Shelters Manufactures before the FY15 Field Season Implementation/Installation in June and further out years.<br /><br />The Forest also seeks potential sources and best practice information regarding the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Radio Communication Shelters which are comprised of (but not limited to) salient characteristics found in the attached "Shelter Specifications" and "Comm Shelter Performance Work Statement Draft".

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE:&nbsp; Amendment changes are underlined in the text below.</span><br /><br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:&nbsp; 1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; 2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and 3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking four (4) Domestic Hubs for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the Domestic Hubs will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>
<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA</span></strong>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listed below are mandatory qualification criteria. The qualification criteria establish conditions that must be met at the time of receipt of capability statements by the Contracting Officer in order for your capability statement to be responsive.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a.	The hub shall be structured to consist of a blood center and one or more transfusion services which support a mixed hospital base of tertiary care and community hospitals.  The hub shall be led by a Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator.  The Principal Investigator must work either at one of the hospital transfusion services or at the blood center.  If based at a transfusion service, the Co-Principal Investigator must work at the blood center.  Conversely, if the Principal Investigator is based at the blood center, the Co-Principal Investigator must be based at a transfusion service.  Each hub shall be required to include a mix of tertiary (at least one) and community (at least one) hospitals to ensure access to diverse adult patient populations and representation of all required services.  Each hub is required to have access to and the demonstrated ability to interact successfully with the following five hospital services:  1) intensive care unit(s); 2) cardiac surgery; 3) orthopedic surgery; 4) oncology/cancer center; and 5) trauma services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">b.	To ensure the statistical relevance of the resulting data, the hub shall provide evidence and supporting documentation for the last two years that at least 75,000 allogeneic donations per year were collected by the hub's blood center.</span></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>During the period from September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020, each of the four Domestic Hubs is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:</p>
<p>1. The hub Principal Investigator shall serve as a member of the REDS-III Oversight Committee.<br />As a member of the Oversight Committee, actively collaborate and participate in the review and approval of the REDS-III Domestic and International study portfolios as well as evaluate program progress to ensure that the objectives of the REDS-III program are being met.</p>
<p>2. The hub Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall serve as voting members of the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee.<br />As members of the Domestic Steering Committee (and its subcommittees, as appropriate), serve as active participants in developing and prioritizing all REDS-III domestic research activities, in overseeing and ensuring the progress of ongoing studies, and in developing, reviewing and approving analyses, presentations, and publications. Collaborate with other hubs to develop a REDS-III domestic program portfolio that will advance transfusion medicine.</p>
<p>3. The hub shall participate in, coordinate, and successfully conduct the REDS-III research protocols that have been approved by the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee. <br />Performance shall be in accordance with study protocols. Provide strong, proactive leadership in dealing with all required hospital services, outpatient services (as appropriate), and the blood center to ensure successful conduct of all research protocols. Coordinate research efforts across hub participants. Obtain all necessary administrative and regulatory clearances. Adhere to all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Incorporate study protocols into blood center/hospital's operations as needed. Contact and enroll participants in study protocols, conduct blood/medical record review, and conduct follow-up visits as required per study protocols. Collect and transmit all data to the DCC as required by each protocol using a data management system provided by the DCC. Collect, process, and ship biospecimens according to protocol specifications. Field all inquiries related to REDS-III research studies. Data shall be analyzed centrally by the REDSIII DCC.</p>
<p>4. The hub shall serve as a Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC).<br />The CCC shall be responsible for obtaining and transmitting donor/donation/component and patient data to the DCC. Obtain all necessary administrative and regulatory clearances. Adhere to all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All hub CCCs shall capture the same donor/donation/component and patient data elements as defined by the Domestic Steering Committee and described in the REDS-III Operating Procedures and Manuals of Operations using a data management system provided to each hub by the DCC. The CCC shall also conduct quality-checks on the data. The CCC shall be responsible for collecting all hub data, transmitting the data to the DCC, and providing the necessary IT and data management expertise to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Conduct quality-checks on the donor/donation/component data files provided by the participating blood center and by additional blood suppliers or by large blood collection systems, if proposed; and collect additional information on the processing of components that may have occurred at the transfusion service/hospital before infusion into recipients. Donor/donation/component data are comprehensive. Data shall include information on all donations collected at the participating blood center(s) including information on non-transfused and transfused donations and their components, some of which are supplied to the hub's participating hospitals. Data shall not include identifying information such as donor's name, social security number, address, etc. but shall include a unique study identification number (ID) for each donor with each donation record, allowing the donor to be longitudinally followed and their individual donations and components identified in the central databases that shall be maintained by the DCC. Data must include screening and confirmatory test results, demographic information, component manufacturing and processing information, and other information as determined by the Domestic Steering Committee. The files including donation/donor/component data are to be provided by the CCC to the DCC in an electronic format in a timely manner for compilation into a central database and for analysis. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC at specified intervals.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Collect and enter data on patients that were transfused as well as those considered for transfusion i.e., cross-matched while admitted at participating hospital services (intensive care unit(s), cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, oncology/cancer center, and trauma services) and outpatient services, as appropriate.

<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking three (3) International Sites (one each in Brazil, China, and South Africa) for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>

The donor/donation data will be compiled for a period of approximately 5 years (60 months). Demographic information on blood donors shall include date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, level of education, country of birth, history of transfusion and geographical area of residence. Information on blood donor status (first-time versus repeat), donation type (e.g., community whole blood), donation date, and donation site shall be collected and provided to the REDS-III DCC. Screening and confirmatory test data shall include detailed results of all individual tests being performed and final screening and confirmatory test interpretations. The donation screening and confirmatory test data shall be transmitted to the REDS-III DCC with minimal delay from time of donation to receipt of confirmatory test results. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Direct the foreign blood collection centers to provide a unique identification&nbsp;number for each donor with each donation record, allowing the donor to be followed longitudinally and for their individual donations to be identified in the data base. This unique donor identifier shall accompany each donation record transmitted to the coordinating center; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Collect, enter, and transmit all study-specific data to the DCC. Data elements to be collected shall be protocol-specific and specified in the corresponding Manual of Operation. These data may be prospectively or retrospectively collected as delineated in the protocol. Data shall be entered by the CCC in a data management system as specified in the protocol, and transmitted to the DCC. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Conduct quality-checks on the donor/donation data files provided by the participating foreign blood centers and on study-specific data. Data must not include identifying information such as donor's name, social security number, address, etc., but must include a unique study identification number (ID) for each donor with each donation record, allowing the donor to be longitudinally followed. The foreign blood centers should maintain the link between the unique study donor identification number and blood center identifier. The link between donor identification number and donor name shall be kept in a secured location by the research staff at the foreign blood centers. The identity of the blood donor shall be known only to the appropriate foreign blood center investigator, but not to the CCC, U.S blood center or REDS-III DCC staff; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Provide data to the REDS-III DCC in an electronic format, as specified by the DCC, in a timely manner for compilation into databases and data sets. English versions of code books must accompany databases and data sets being provided to the DCC. This information shall be a deliverable to the DCC at specified intervals; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Implement procedures to maintain data security and confidentiality.</p>
<p>7. The U.S. blood center shall be responsible for translating all materials. <br />Translate study materials (protocols including informed consents, questionnaires, and forms) and Manuals of Operations prepared in collaboration with the DCC to appropriate languages or dialects, or to English, as appropriate. Final protocols and Manuals of Operations must be approved in writing by the NHLBI REDS-III Contracting Officer's Representative(s).</p>
<p>8. The U.S. blood center shall oversee the collection, processing, testing, and storage of biospecimens by the foreign blood collection sites as required by study protocols. <br />Samples shall be cataloged, tested, and stored according to protocols. The international sites shall be responsible for the conduct of all laboratory testing not being conducted in the U.S. which should represent the vast majority of required testing. Collection of specimens as part of laboratory-based research studies or epidemiologic investigations is permitted and can be established at the foreign blood centers or at a central location. However, large, labor-intensive repositories or population-based repositories (usually &gt; 100,000 biospecimens) are not within the current scope of this program. Strict confidentiality of biospecimens, test results and related data shall be maintained by all REDS-III participants.</p>
<p>9. In collaboration with the REDS-III central laboratory and the DCC, the U.S. blood center shall oversee the shipment of specific biospecimens of research interest to the U.S. for laboratory testing which for technical or financial reasons is better accomplished at the central laboratory (or at another US testing facility subcontracted by the central laboratory).</p>
<p>10. Participate in all committee and subcommittee meetings, conference calls, and organizational training sessions of which the international site Investigators and staff are members.</p>
<p>11. The U.S. blood center and foreign blood collection sites shall obtain all necessary governmental, administrative and regulatory approvals to ensure participation in and successful completion of all studies included in the REDS-III country-specific research portfolio.<br />The U.S. blood center and foreign blood collection sites shall obtain all governmental, administrative and regulatory approvals necessary to 1) conduct the research program in the foreign country; 2) provide to the REDS-III DCC data from all blood collections, epidemiologic studies, laboratory studies, and surveys conducted under the contract; and 3) provide any required selected biospecimens to the REDS-III central laboratory and potentially the NHLBI Biological Specimen Repository in the U.S.</p>

The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a realistic, relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting training in multiple intelligence disciplines such as: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).      <br>        <br>    The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a. Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation data, it provides exercise control and support tools, authoring tools and scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to local/ closed networks and, in some instances, remote training locations via secure Joint/ Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any number of multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in a free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.      <br>        <br>    IEWTPT supports individual and/ or collective intelligence sustainment training by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environment capabilities and generating and/or augmenting and providing simulation-born data feeds to  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The planning and prototyping has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability. The IEWTPT system is fielded to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations.    <br>        <br>    Additional information describing the IEWTPT programs can be found on the U.S. Army PEO STRI PM ConSim website, http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/IEWTPT/    <br>        <br>    An Industry Day-Market Research Meeting is scheduled for 09:00.A.M - 5:00 P.M. on 8 January, 2015 to provide information about this requirement. (8:30 A.M. registration begins)    <br>        <br>    The meeting will be held in 12000 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. Room 304 A and B.     <br>        <br>    To ensure adequate space is available, organizations are limited to three (3) representatives (3 representatives inclusive of prime and sub per team).

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $269.118.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   12/31/2014	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. 

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
The existing building management system was installed by the OEM manufacturer, Siemens Industry, Inc.  The software used is proprietary to Siemens and the installed controllers  will not function with 	
another vendors system.  Only Siemens is able to provide the service and programs the controllers installed at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System.	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
The existing building management system was installed by the OEM manufacturer, Siemens Industry, Inc.  The software used is proprietary to Siemens and the installed controllers will not funcition with another vendors system.  Only Siemens is able t provide service and programs the controllers already installed.	

1	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
_The panel and computer upgrades are replacing existing older equipment that the vendor will no longer support due to age of the equipment.  

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
The new equipment must interface with the existing building management  infrastructure already installed at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare system, the sensors, temperature monitors and other devices must work with Siemens Software and Hardware Systems.  The existing building management system is built around Siemens proprietary PPCL (Powers Process Control Language) .  In order to integrate into the existing system any new equipment must have a controls sequence written in the same language.	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This procurement represents the best value to the government  because  upgrading the system through the OEM vendor, given the proprietary nature  software  is cheaper that competing this procurement which might result in replacing all the controllers and all the other Siemens  equipment already installed at the VAAAHS.	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS and the internet were searched.  GSA Schedule 246 01 Smart Building Systems Integrator, shows  	
five vendors, Ameresco, C&C Sales, Siemens, Signet Technolgies, System Development.  Only Siemens, the OEM vendor, is able to service and upgrade Siemens building monitoring equipment via an FSS Contract.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey.  	




(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
