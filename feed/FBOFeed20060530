<SUBJECT>A -- TRUST for Integrated Circuits
<SOLNBR>BAA06-40
<RESPDATE>081106
<ARCHDATE>05302007
<CONTACT>Dean Collins, Program Manager-MTO, Phone 571-218-4650, Fax 703-248-8031, Email dean.collins@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of TRUST for Integrated Circuits. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems. Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement upon existing state-of-the-art. 

Largely because of global economic pressures, fabrication of advanced integrated circuits is migrating to foreign foundries.  In addition, business models are increasingly driven by commercial, rather then military, demand. Dedicated facilities cannot provide the performance, variety and volume of microchips that the DoD needs. These trends have raised concern regarding U.S. weapons systems reliance on high performance microchips and potential vulnerabilities to these systems caused by malicious manipulation of hardware and software processes that might render these vital systems inoperable at some future time. This situation is true for both ASIC and COTS parts. 

Furthermore, there are issues with protecting intellectual property and military secrets as they are often embedded in the design of microcircuits, and the details of this design are often needed by the manufacturer in the fabrication process. 

Finally, there are also issues associated with protecting intellectual property and military secrets after the systems are deployed,  especially in circumstances where systems and components are lost, captured or are no longer under U.S. control and subject to reverse engineering over a sustained period of time. 

This new DARPA initiative is being considered to address the above issues and others that have been identified in the DSB study on High Performance Microchip Supply [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-02-HPMS_Report_Final.pdf]. The report addresses design, the use of advanced design tools, fabrication, packaging, testing, and monitoring of high performance IC’s within critical systems and subsystems. Specific areas of interest to DARPA include TRUST, Information Leakage and Anti-Tamper; although the primary interest is TRUST. DARPA will also engage in a Metrics-for-TRUST task focused on measuring the value of DARPA investments in novel technologies. To be clear, DARPA is only interested in issues related to TRUSTed Integrated Circuits and is not interested in proposals pertaining to issues concerning printed circuit boards or the general area of malicious software.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort. The technical POC for this effort is Dean R. Collins, Deputy Director-MTO, Phone 571-218-4650, Fax 703-696-2206, Email dean.collins@darpa.mil.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 06-40,TRUST for Integrated Circuits, Proposer Information Pamphlet," Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on technical areas of interest to DARPA.

<SUBJECT>A -- NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR THE INTEGRATED SPACE COMMAND AND CONTROL
<SOLNBR>F19628-00-C-0019
<CONTACT>Douglas Smith douglas.smith@cisf.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that the 850th Electronic Systems Group, Electronic Systems Center, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado intends to solicit and negotiate with Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the continuation of the Integrated Space Command and Control (ISC2) contract, F19628-00-C-0019, for FY07-FY15. This approach implements the approved acquisition strategy that was previously announced in the CBD on 21 Oct 98, 10 Sep 99 and 15 May 00 and fully documented in the ISC2 request for proposal, source selection criteria and contract award.  The initial period of performance for the ISC2 contract was 12 months plus 5 Option Years with a total potential performance period of 15 years in accordance with the Award Term Plan. As announced previously, pricing for contract years 7-15, if awarded, will be negotiated between the Government and the ISC2 contractor on a sole source basis without further competition. The ISC2 contract is a vehicle for acquiring the Combatant Commanders Integrated Command and Control System (CCIC2S), formerly known as the NORAD/USSPACECOM Warfighting Support System (N/UWSS), and for developing, evolving, sustaining, and integrating AFSPACECOM and USSTRATCOM Space C2 capabilities. The contract also provides operational support for the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (CMC) evolved C2 Systems. The scope of ISC2 includes the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (CMC), Mobile Command and Control Centers (MCCC); Shared Early Warning System (SEWS), USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC); Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), Cheyenne Mountain Training System (CMTS) and Forward User locations. In addition, this contract provides for integration among all of the systems listed above, as well as provides for the integration of these systems with other DoD C2 systems (e.g. SBIRS, NMD LSI, C2JPS, TBMCS, ISPAN, C2BMC, etc.). The ISC2 contract will modernize the command and control (C2) system of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) into an integrated, interoperable, net-centric, state of the art capability to support the National Command Authority and the Canadian Chief of Defense Staff for the defense of North America.  The C2 system provides warning of ballistic missile, aircraft, space, and information attacks against North America.  The modernization will significantly enhance USSTRATCOM’s ability to command space forces, provide global warning of ballistic missile attacks, and improve space support to theater warfighters and coalition partners.  Using modern software, ISC2 will integrate worldwide communications networks, computer systems, and software to provide an integrated view of worldwide events that will ensure complete and timely situational awareness that can support political and military command decisions world wide. The primary focus of the ISC2 effort is to: (1) reduce the cost of ownership; (2) increase flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving mission needs; and (3) improve interoperability between Space C2 and the warfighting COCOM support systems; all the while maintaining mission integrity of this critical, 24/7 national defense mission operation. Interested parties that believe they have the requisite capabilities to perform this effort shall submit no more than a 10 page white paper detailing their capabilities as a lead systems integrator and C2 systems developer as well as any relevant past performance to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of this announcement. Your submittal shall include a transition plan as to how you will continue development of the existing CCIC2S system architecture, air warning C2 system, missile warning C2 system, network system operations monitoring capability, Space Battle Management Core System development, Space C2 applications development, USSTRATCOM Strategic Threat Analysis Reporting System, GOC Upgrade Phase 2 and continued sustainment and support of the MCCC, SEWS, existing legacy and migrated air, missile and space C2 systems within the CMC, the GOC, JSpOC, NMCC, ANMCC and multiple forward users without causing any delay to the current delivery schedules, system down time or duplication of/increase in costs. The transition plan shall include mitigation plans for developing or mitigating access to restricted or proprietary data currently held by LM-IS&S and a staffing plan to indicate their ability to provide 500 TS/SSBI cleared personnel upon contract award.  Other important information: (a) Past experience in the migration to net-centric operations, foreign military sales and why you believe your company is capable of performing as a Prime Contractor, (b) Demonstrate your understanding of the problems that the ISC2 Contract must address and what potential risks you foresee that would preclude successfully achieving the objectives set forth above and (c) Demonstrated capability in HEMP hardened mobile systems, competency in the operations and sustainment of multi-level classified environments. Key competencies to be considered: systems engineering, program management, security management, logistics and test. Your submittal shall be on CD ROM in an MS Office compatible electronic format and on 8 ½ x 11 paper with one-sided pages, 12 pitch font and one inch margins to be delivered to 850 ELSG/PK, Attn: Doug Smith, 1050 E Stewart Ave, Bldg 2025, Peterson AFB, CO 80914 no later than 1400 local time.

Address all questions to the Contracting Officer, Doug Smith, 719-556-6334 or Lt Olga Brandt, 719-556-9351. This synopsis is for information only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. Please note: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for an Architectural Engineering Firm
FOR THE J.P. KINNEARY U.S. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, COLUMBUS, OHIO
Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P06GBC3010 Columbus, Ohio
Through the preservation and modernization of an historic building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture.  In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented designers and artists to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 to 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.

In this context, (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including P-100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service).  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, security requirements, and the requirements of the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services are required for the restoration and improvements to the building exterior, for an accessibility entrance and other improvements to the J.P. Kinneary U.S. Courthouse, 85 Marconi Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43215.  The 5 story building was constructed in 1934 and contains approximately 318,258 gross square feet with parking.  The design must follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the existing historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements.   The building houses 165 federal employees from the US Courts, US Attorney, US Marshals and other miscellaneous agencies.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $8,000,000 and $18,000,000.

PROJECT SCOPE OF WORK:
The major part of the work will consist of masonry restoration.  The sandstone facades are in need of major repairs to remove safety hazards, extend the life of the building and improve its appearance.  The existing windows of the garage skylight are original to the building and in need of replacement.  A Public Accessibility route at the main entrance to the courthouse does not currently exist and must be provided to satisfy the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).  Other needed improvements include:  Exterior perimeter drainage replacement;  Interior basement drainage repairs;  Roof skylight repairs;  Repair of other entrance stairs, doors and rails;  Improving locations of surveillance  cameras and exterior lighting;  Miscellaneous exterior improvements.  
The scope of Architect/Engineer services required under this proposed contract may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Survey of existing conditions; Detail scope verification;  Presentations for client and historic preservation agencies;  Complete design services including the preparation of construction contract CAD drawings, specifications and cost estimates;   Space layouts;  Interior design;  Shop drawing reviews;  Construction inspection services and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  The work will involve all design disciplines including architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and fire protection.  Throughout the design process, the selected A-E may assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that may incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created, formatted, and submitted in a CAD program compatible with GSA’s software standards.. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall also be submitted digitally in software compatible with GSA’s standards. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense. The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106.  Design submissions will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed.  Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the building’s restoration or preservation zones identified in the Building Preservation Plan.  Alteration or removal of original materials and design requires special justification and a Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO, documenting concurrence on measures to mitigate all adverse effects to the historic building.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Lockheed Martin Corporation, 9500 Godwin Drive, Manassas, VA  20110 for the acquisition of four (4) power distribution units, six (6) NavC2 server 1 disks, six (6) NavC2 server 2 disks, six 96) VMS server 1 disks, six (6) VMS server 2 disks, six (6) Unit 4 console disks, and six (6) console trackballs.  The equipment and software will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Lockheed Martin is the sole manufacturer of this equipment and software.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with these parts installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be a!  ltered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts.    This would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the equipment and software are acquired from Lockheed Martin Corporation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to Dowty Aerospace Corporation, Sterling, VA  20166-9321 for on-call engineering and technical services for a 12 month period to be used by the government for repair process development and product improvement evaluations on LCAC Propeller System Components and Assemblies. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: Provision of these services requires the use of proprietary Original Equipment Manufacturer's data and tooling that currently reside solely at the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, and the propeller system was developed by the Dowty Aerospace Corporation at company expense and provided to the U.S. Navy's LCAC program under a competitively awarded subcontract from the program's prime contractor, Textron Marine Systems. As the propeller system components are proprietary to the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, no other manufacturer has supplied these system components or design alteration data since this original contract. It is estimated that the cost of developing an alternate capability would greatly exceed the estimated value of the services needed. Thus, the Dowty Aerospace Corporation is the only source that can cost-effectively supply the required services. Short notice specific tasking and expedited service delivery as completed will be required. A firm-fixed-price order is anti!  cipated. Award will be based on the written quotation. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Susan David for the on-going support to NIDA and various networks throughout the NIDA Network Initiative Project.  NIDA has several research networks collecting data at sites throughout the country.  These networks operate independently from one another and the level of communication among them likely varies widely.  The purpose of this solicitation is to explore whether there is any value added to enhancing the communication among the networks.  It is possible that the data emerging from these networks can not only inform the activities of the other networks, but may also stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations among the established networks.  Furthermore, research dissemination efforts could be enhanced through these collaborations.  Susan David will be identifying common themes, objectives and benefits of organizations working together in collaboration; coordinating the development of networks and networking efforts; providing drug abuse and addiction research and experience in working and communicating with scientists and professionals in the field and developing communication materials and packages that can serve as models for dissemination.  Ms. David has worked with other government agencies, added over 100 hospitals to the network within six (6) months, coordinated multi-ethnic networks and coordinated the re-design and development of drug addition and prevention websites.  Soliciting another source could cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition (FAR 6.302-1 (A)), as well as, unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement (FAR 6.302-1 (B)).  The Government intends to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory (NVFEL), Health Effects, Benefits and Toxics Center requires a testing program for small non-road engines.  The Energy Act of 2005 requires a minimum level of renewable fuel use in the transportation sector beginning in 2006.  The majority of this renewable fuel is expected to be ethanol.  This ethanol is expected to be blended into gasoline in a ratio of about 1:9 resulting in a volumetric content of 10%.  EPA is trying to improve its ability to estimate the impact of the increased use of ethanol in gasoline on emissions. EPA seeks proposals to provide the Agency with a testing program that will focus on small non-road engines which meet EPA?s Phase II emission standards.  The testing program will also include three fuels.  The base period will consist of testing eight engines using two fuels in accordance with the specifications identified in the statement of work.    EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan will provide test fuels and test engines.  The contractor will provide all personnel, materials, equipment (other than the identified test fuels and test engines), and facilities to perform the tasks identified in the Statement of Work.  The Statement of Work will be included as an attachment to the solicitation.   The Government anticipates the award of a firm fixed price completion type contract with a twelve month base period and the potential for three optional items.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380.  This is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  All responsible sources may submit a written proposal which will be considered by the agency.  FAR Part 12 does not apply. Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet.  Offerors should visit EPA?s Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd) for continuous update of RFP?s status.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be available in late- July 2006.

Napoles, 03810, Mexico, D.F., Phone: (011-52-55) 5536-7880,  Fax: (011-52-55) 5682-5873, E-mail: ocorzo@sct.gob.mx, eescam@sct.gob.mx          The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Master Plan for Multimodal Corridors (Master Plan) Project.

In June 2004, twenty-two public and private organizations met with Mexican President Vicente Fox in to sign a collaboration agreement to promote the development of multimodal corridors in Mexico.  The goal of this agreement was to increase economic competitiveness via the coordination of the connected parties responsible for the facilitation and development of logistic links within and outside Mexico. With the strong commitment of the private sector to this Project, the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), the Ministry responsible for the Mexican transportation sector, took the lead in moving this agenda forward.

The SCT requested funding from U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for a Master Plan that will assist in the planning and promotion of Mexico’s commercial transportation system and the infrastructure that can support increased volumes of trade between Mexico, the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.  The proposed Master Plan is intended to provide a “road map” for the SCT and private sector transportation and logistics providers as to what is required to improve Mexico’s transportation infrastructure so as to realize a more efficient and cost effective supply chain.  The objective of the Master Plan is to provide the SCT with a strategic vision for multimodal transportation linkages, and in turn, Mexico’s freight transportation and logistics service providers and customers with a blueprint for future investment.

The scope of this technical assistance will include an analysis of the main cargo origins and destinations; an analysis of current inter-modal infrastructure, services and equipment in Mexico; an assessment of the potential multimodal corridors in Mexico and their international connection; an assessment of requirements of infrastructure, equipment, services and facilities for the development of multimodal corridors; the development of a tool to evaluate the performance and competitiveness of the multimodal corridors in operation; as well as an economic and social impact assessment of the multimodal corridors at the regional, municipal, state, national and international levels.  This Technical Assistance will enable the SCT to compare national and international systems, assist Mexico in developing a more competitive transportation network.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,323,900 dollar grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and an edited compilation of two Definitional Mission final reports are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit one English version and (1) copy and one Spanish version and six (6) copies of their Proposal directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. LOCAL TIME, July 21, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) on behalf of the Nanoscale Metrology Group, Scanning Electron Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with FEI Company of Hillsboro, OR, for the following equipment:
		
1.  Plantinum Deposition – FEI Part #FP3400/30
2.  Uninterruptible Power Supply – FEI Part #FP3550/90
3.  6 Channel Detector Amplifier – FEI Part #FP6843/50
4.  Solid State 16 STEM Detector Type II – FEI Part #6930/xx
5.  SDB Cryo-Transfer System 

This requirement is for the purchase of the equipment listed above, which are upgrades to the NIST owned Dual Electron Beam Scanning Electron Microscope.

The activity of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Laboratory of the Nanoscale Metrology Group has moved into new 
territories, which include work on nano-particles.  There is a 
currently running Competence Project, which is titled: 
“Metrology for the “Fate” of Nanoparticles in Biosystems.”  The work in this project calls for biological sample preparation for imaging and dimensional measurements of samples at the nano-scale.  Fresh biological specimens are typically incompatible with SEM because of the vacuum necessary for instrument operation. 

Purchase Order Number SB1341-03-N-1895 was awarded in September 2003 to FEI Company under full and open competition, for the purchase of a NOVA 600 NanoLab No Charge (LoVac) Dual Beam System.  This instrument incorporated advanced laser  interferometry in the specimen stage to accurately track the X and Y motion of the stage.  

A standard accessory to the FEI instrument is a customized cryo-sample preparation instrument and cryo-sample stage combination.   Referred to by FEI as the SDB Cryo-Transfer System, this system is only available from FEI and it is made specifically for the existing dual beam SEM.

The platinum (Pt) deposition attachment will allow for sample preparation with well-defined edges, which is required for many types of work essential to the mission of the Nanoscale Metrology Group.  Adding a new electron detector that could collect transmitted electrons will give different, and, in many cases, the best resolution images. 

These images carry and provide additional information, depend on different contrast mechanism.  This new information is crucial for many nano-metrology applications. 
  
Adding an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to SEMs will provide safety and security for these expensive instruments in the case of power failures. These are fully integrated with their instrumentation, which provides reliability and data integrity that cannot be achieved with other, third party solutions. 

Sole source determination is based on the following:  The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  FEI has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to FEI.  FEI has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide this upgrade.   

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 12, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Acquisition Executive, in coordination with the DFAS Contract Services Directorate (CSD) is  developing the acquisition strategy for the Systems Management and Engineering Services (SM&ES) Contract.  The scope of the SM&ES  is to acquire a full range of performance-based Information Technology services necessary  to support the DFAS enterprise infrastructure and information goals. Specifically, contracts awarded are targeted to support development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements, as well as program management functions, to include development of required Life-Cycle Management (LCM) documentation.  Specific details will be described in individual Task Orders issued under the Contract.  

It is anticipated that the SM&ES Contract will be a multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle. The Government intends to conduct this acquisition under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Contractors will be required to support a minimum of SECRET security clearance.  The period of performance for these contracts will be a one-year base with four, one-year option periods.  The estimated total value of this acquisition is $300 Million. 

DFAS will be conducting Market Research as part of the acquisition planning phase.  As such, it has developed an on-line Market Research Questionnaire which can be found at http://www.dod.mil/dfas/about/BusinessOpportunities/ActiveSolicitations.html  .  The purpose of this survey is to gain a better understanding of the marketplace, including small business participation, commercial and industry best practices, performance metrics and measurements, innovative delivery methods, effective incentive programs and pricing models.  Prospective vendors are encouraged to participate in this market research by completing the on-line questionnaire no later than April 28, 2006.  Requests for an extension will be considered.  

This Market Research is being conducted for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of  DFAS to acquire any products or services.  DFAS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of information obtained from this Questionnaire or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this Questionnaire is voluntary.  

Vendors are advised that Acquisition Solutions, Inc. (ASI), 1655 Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA, has been retained to provide acquisition support during the SM&ES   acquisition to include review of the Market Research responses, development of the RFP requirements, and the eventual source selection process.  ASI is expressly prohibited from competing on this acquisition and will not participate in  recommending a source for award.    

All future messages and documents regarding this acquisition will be found on the FedBizOpp and DFAS Business Opportunity web sites.  The requirements and strategy as stated in the notice are all subject to change as the acquisition evolves.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

14.	In Room 16A, tap transformer output terminals and extend 4#4, and 1#8G, in 1-inch EMT to the existing 225-amp panel-board in Room 16A.  Remove the existing main breaker from the existing 225-amp panel-bard and install a 3-pole 50-amp main circuit breaker. The existing panel-board is lightly loaded, with only about four circuits, and, the intent is to limit the load that this panel-board can place on the transformer.       

15.	The transformer is a separately-derived system – and shall be grounded per NEC 250.30.  From neutral stud of the transformer, install one, bare, 2/0, copper grounding electrode conductor, 
un-spliced, from Room 16A, to the 5th floor electrical closet, then, down the stack of closets, to the main switch-bard room, connecting this GEC conductor to the building grounding electrode system. This grounding electrode conductor must be un-spliced from the transformer on the 5th floor to the grounding electrode connection on the 1st floor. If deficiencies are perceived to exist in the building grounding-electrode-system, notify the Government.


16.	In Room 16A, in the transformer output feeder run, install one 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, enclosed, circuit-breaker, to protect the feeder conductors and protect the transformer. Lock this circuit breaker in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

17.	In computer room, install 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, safety switch – coordinating location with the Tenant Agency and Representatives of the Contracting Officer. Coordination is required here. Equipment exists in the computer room work areas - that must be removed in a phased manner. Lock this safety switch in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

18.	From near-by room on the 5th floor, transport an existing UPS by-pass switch in to the computer room and place in final location. This weight of this item is not deemed excessive and this item may be placed on the existing raised flooring.     

19.	Examine two additional pieces of existing UPS equipment, in a nearby 5th floor room, and, design and fabricate a steel support stand to support these two pieces of equipment in the computer room. Recent inspection time on site time did not permit a detailed examination or design for this support stand. Some time will be required on site determine the exact locations of equipment to be installed in the computer room and coordinate the design of an adequate support stand with the existing raised flooring that must be removed and determine base runner arrangements that can distribute the weight over a wide area. The Contractor can spend this time on site and investigate all site conditions – in coordination with GSA, and the Tenant Agency. 

  	The Contractor shall measure the two existing pieces of UPS equipment and prepare a sketch of a proposed steel stand to be placed on the concrete flooring in the computer room to support these two UPS items: one stand will be fabricated to support these two heavy UPS items. The stand will include the following features.           
(1) 	Distribute the weight of the two UPS items, evenly, along the concrete flooring under the existing raised flooring – over a foot-print much greater than the combined foot-print of the two UPS items.     
(2) 	Construct support system with angle iron with minimum dimensions of 5”x 5” x required lengths.  
(3) 	Provide two main base runs of angle iron that extended under the un-disturbed raised flooring at least four feet on two sides of the UPS equipment - beyond the foot print of the supported equipment. The total length of these two base runners will be the width of the footprint of the UPS equipment plus an additional eight feet – four feet on each side of the UPS equipment for and estimated total length of 12 feet. These two main base runners can be placed under the existing raised flooring, one at a time, then, the remainder of the support system set in place, on the runners, and bolted to the runners forming one rigid support system. This approach will distribute the weight over a wide area. Permanent removal of existing raised-flooring will occur in an amount slightly larger than the footprint of the two UPS equipment items. 
(4) 	The support system will contain a raised section that is a little larger than the foot-print of the two UPS items, and, will coordinate with the removal of raised floor tiles. The top of this raised support will be at the same elevation as the adjacent raised flooring. 
(5) 	The support system shall permit bottom conduit access into each of the UPS equipment items.
(7) 	Permit ventilation under the raised flooring to reach the UPS equipment. 
(8)	Prior to fabricating this support, prepare sketches and submit to the Government for review. Show in plan view the existing raised flooring that will be permanently removed.  Show the support system in its final position with the existing surrounding raised flooring abutting the support. Show elevation views viewing each side of the support system – viewed from beneath the raised flooring. Show a frontal elevation view of the UPS equipment in place resting upon the support system. GSA architects and structural engineers will review these sketches adequacy and décor. An Architect would be helpful in the preparation of these sketches. Record on the sketches the weight of each piece of equipment. Each weight is on the name-plate data of the equipment. 
(9)	Paint the entire metal support system with three coats of a, durable, black, enamel paint, selected to approximate the color of the UPS equipment.   	

(10)	After approval of a design for the support stand, portions of the stand should be fabricated off-site, then, brought into the computer room for final assembly. Final assembly must be accomplished using bolts. Welding will not be permitted. 

20.	Transport the two remaining pieces of UPS equipment, from a 5th floor office area into the computer room – placing on the support stand. The battery cabinet shall be transported with out batteries. Examine the conduit knock-outs to determine proper placement for the installation of interconnect conduits – coordinating with US Coast Guard Personnel to verify the orientation of these two cabinets. It is believed that that the battery cabinet should be placed to the left of the UPS cabinet – when viewed from the front. 

21.	Interconnect the battery cabinet and the UPS cabinet with liquid-tight flex conduit – sized to the knock-outs in the cabinets. 

22.	From transformer in Room 16A, via enclosed CB, extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and , and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the nearby computer room – traveling under the raised floor in the computer room, and rising into the following safety switch.  Extend neutral, un-spliced, through the disconnect switch, into the by-pass cabinet. The neutral is sized @ 173% of the phase-conductor capacity shown on the UPS name-plate data.    	      

23.	From safety switch in computer room extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and, and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the by-pass switch cabinet. Do not make connection in the by-pass cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor. 

24.	From by-pass switch cabinet, install two runs of 4-inch, liquid-tight flex conduit, to serve the UPS cabinet, with bottom feed. In each flex run, install 3#400 MCM phase conductors,  
1#700 MCM neutral, and 1#3 ground. [These are nominal sizes, based upon abbreviated APC literature. The Contractor shall consult with US Coast Guard Personnel and obtain a name and contact for APC – the Manufacturer of the UPS equipment and coordinate conductor sizes down stream of the by-pass switch cabinet with APC Technical Personnel- retaining name and telephone number of the APC Personnel providing the information. ]   Do not make connections in the by-pass cabinet or the UPS cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor.     

25.	In computer room in location coordinated with GSA and the U. S. Coast Guard, install a new, 
225-amp, main-breaker, 42-pole panel-board, non-linear panel-board, with 225-amp main breaker.   
This panel will include a 200% neutral bus, isolated ground terminals and equipment ground terminals. 

26.	From UPS unit, to new 225-amp panel-board, install 3# 4/0 phase conductors, 1#500MCM neutral, 1#4G, in 3-inch LT flex conduit.   

27.	The UPS unit is considered a separately-derived system and must be grounded as such: the neutral must be grounded in the same manner as the neutral in the 112.5KVA transformer in Room 16A. 
	Either in the UPS unit or in the 225-amp panel-board, cadweld a bare #4 grounding-electrode-conductor to the 500MCM neutral and extend this bare GEC conductor into Room 16A, cadwelding the #4 GEC to the #2 GEC that serves the 112.5KVA transformer. The GEC is not required to be in conduit, but, must be protected. Route under raised floor, along walls, protecting with PVC conduit in congested areas.   

28.	One circuit at a time, and in coordination with the US Coast Guard, transfer about twenty existing branch circuits from an existing panel-board in the computer room – into the new UPS 
panel-board. Where the existing circuits are of in-sufficient length, replace the entire conduit and circuit run with new wire and LT flex conduit – of the proper size and phase arrangement.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>MODIFICATION#1 IS HEREBY ISSUED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES.  PROCUREMENT # PR-NC-06-10284 IS BEING DIVIDED AND WILL BE PROCESSED AS TWO SEPARATE EFFORTS WITH TWO SEPARATE SOLICITATIONS (PR-NC-06-10284 AND PR-NC-06-10536) BEING ISSUED.  THE PR-NC-06-10284 REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCESSED AS A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  PR-NC-06-10536 WILL BE PROCESSED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  A SIMILAR NOTICE HAS ALSO BEEN ISSUED UNDER PR-NC-06-10536.  THE BASE QUANTITY LABOR HOURS FOR EACH ONE OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTS WILL CONSIST OF 7,500 HOURS FOR A NINE (9) MONTH BASE PERIOD AND 10,000 BASE QUANTITY LABOR HOURS FOR EACH ONE OF THE OPTION PERIODS.  EACH  CONTRACT WILL ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL QUANTITY LABOR HOURS IN THE AMOUNT OF 22,500 OPTIONAL QUANTITY LABOR HOURS FOR THE BASE PERIOD AND 30,000 OPTIONAL QUANTITY LABOR HOURS FOR EACH ONE OF THE OPTION PERIODS FOR A TOTAL OF 190,000 LABOR HOURS FOR EACH CONTRACT. The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from  national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contracts will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary  sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57)  months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month  option periods.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This requirement is not a follow on effort.  The RFP will be issued approximately on June 23, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date. The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  The Government is obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.

VR&E services are described in the attached draft SOW and other draft attachments included in this RFI.  This is a sources sought announcement, and is not a request for quotations or a request for proposals.  VA has an Integrated Process Team (IPT) looking at alternatives acquisition strategies to determine best possible outcome on the re-compete of these services.  The IPT team will be formed to include internal shareholders from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the VA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and the contracting officer as well as industry.  The purpose of the IPT is to develop and implement an acquisition strategy to enhance the performance of VR&E contractors while maximizing cost savings. The VA is looking for alternatives and is looking for industries' input as to what the market will bear.   The VA is looking for alternatives to include consolidation by region or national contracts to include Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan or Performance Requirement Survey (to include present risks and benefits of each alternative).  To all interested parties review all attached material (draft RFQ, frequently asked questions, etc.) and provide information that should be considered prior to making a final decision on appropriate acquisition strategy.

During the course of these contracts the government issued task orders to each contractor receiving an award under these multiple award contract.  The minimum cumulative amount of all orders for any single Contractor was $500.00 over the life of the contract.  The maximum cumulative amount for all orders for any single contractor providing services under these contracts was $3,000,000.00 over the life of the contract.  The period of performance was for base year plus four one year options. The government is looking for new strategy to use in the award of the new contracts for VR&E.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS for ITES-2H.  The U.S. Army Small Computer Program (ASCP) in coordination with the Army Contracting Agency (ACA), Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), intends to release a Draft Request For Proposal ( RFP) to support the Armys requirement for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, consisting of, but not limited to purchase or lease of COTS servers, workstations, managed platforms (both desktops and notebooks), thin client devices, networking equipme nt, storage systems, network cabling, video teleconferencing products (VTC), as well as associated factory orderable upgrades and related peripherals such as printers, scanners, digital cameras, displays (including plasma, Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Digital L ight Processor (DLP), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) High Definition Television (HDTV), equipment cabinets, transit cases, and other related accessories. The contracts will be open to other Agencies (i.e. Navy, Air Force, DoD components, FMS, and other Feder al agencies) to satisfy their Information Technology requirements (IT).  IT products procured through this acquisition are required to comply with DoD and Army standards, such as the DoD IT Standards Registry  Federal Information Processing Standards.  The  Army intends to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts. The contracts will have a five-year period of performance with a three-year base period and two (2) one  year option periods.  The total estimated value is $5B.  The Govern ment will conduct the acquisition under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. The government intends to conduct a full and open competition with up to two awards reserved for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)  code for this acquisition is 517110 (Telecommunications Network, Wired) with small business size standard of 1,500 employees.  Contractors will be required to support up to a Secret security clearance.  Some orders may require Top Secret (TS) Sensitive Co mpartmented Information (SCI).  Delivery to the address(es) specified on each delivery order shall be within 30 calendar days for CONUS and 35 calendar days for OCONUS locations.  The price of shipping CONUS will be included in the fixed price of the produ ct.  The price of shipping OCONUS will be handled as an ODC, within restraints, negotiated at the order level.  The Contractor shall provide commercial on-site warranties to all locations within and Outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) for all products delivered.  On-site or mail-back or hot-swap warranty shall be offered to the customer for portable systems.  The Government shall not incur additional charges (i.e. shipping, delivery) for warranty support.  The option to purchase extended wa rranties in one-year increments shall be offered for all products delivered.  Any time-of-purchase restrictions for the purchase of extended warranties shall be in accordance with the contractors policy.  The Contractor shall provide a method for performi ng warranty service for Remote OCONUS locations.  The Contractor shall provide for the repair or replacement of equipment including transportation/shipping costs to and from the customers site.  The warranty period shall commence upon the receipt of the e quipment at the final destination identified on the delivery order or 35 days after shipment from the contractors facility, whichever is sooner.  Due to the security limitations in South Korea and delays associated with custom clearance, limited Status of  Forces Agreement (SOFA) will be included for that country to enable contract performance.  NOTE:  The Government intends to utilize an Advisory Multi-Step process in accordance with FAR 15.202 to allow the Government the opportunity to advise offerors abo ut their potential to be viable competitors.  In order to participate in the Advisory Multi-Step process, potential prime contractors will respond to the Govern ments forthcoming request to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating their experience and capabilities.  The draft acquisition schedule is provided as follows.  All dates are subject to change. The Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released o n June 1, 2006.  Industry Day will be held on June 15, 2006.  The Advisory Multi-Step will be released on June 26, 2006 with submissions due July 10, 2006.  The Government will release viability notifications July 31, 2006.  The Final RFP will be released on August 8, 2006.  The proposals will be due 30 days after Final RFP release.  Vendors may access information and documentation regarding the ITES-2H acquisition through the FBO website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, or directly at the Army Single Face to I ndustry (ASFI) website, https://acquisition.army.mil/.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, has a requirement for spare VSAT modem and routers to support existing equipment being used in GSN stations that provide real time data for earthquake location and Tsunami warning. This equipment must have identical hardware, with identical programming and firmware.  MP Integral was the original supplier of this equipment and is currently the servicing teleport.  All configurations must match with the servicing teleport.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified software as a sole source from MP Integral Telecommunications, 24800 I-45 North, The Woodlands, Texas, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport (NUWC Division Keyport) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N00253-06-T-0145. NUWC Division Keyport is interested in proposals that identify Multi-Frequency Underwater Tracking Transducers that will be able to transmit and receive multiple frequencies in an undersea environment.  For first round consideration, proposals in response to this BAA shall be received by 15 June 2006, 1500 hours Pacific Time, addressed to Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Acquisition Division, 610 Dowell Street, Keyport WA 98345, Attn: Ms. Monique Klose.  For second round consideration, proposals in response to this BAA shall be received by 14 July 2006, 1500 hours Pacific Time.  For third round consideration, proposals in response to this BAA shall be received by 15 Aug 2006, 1500 hours Pacific Time.  This is an unrestricted solicitation. The purpose of this announcement is to investigate innovative!   commercial technologies and approaches to transmit and receive multiple frequencies underwater using underwater tracking transducers.  In addition, the Navy is seeking to establish a broad base of capable and knowledgeable contractors that may compete for future contracts involving transmission and receipt of multiple frequencies using underwater tracking transducers.  Under this broad agency announcement, contracts will be awarded to those contractors who are determined technically acceptable. Proposals must include the following: A technical proposal consisting of no more than five 8 inch x 11 inch pages that details how its technology may be used in the transmission of data and telemetry between a submarine and a fixed platform using acoustic modems. Commercial product brochures may be provided as supplementary information. The technical proposal will be reviewed and evaluated for technical acceptability. Elements considered in determining technical acceptability will b!  e realism and innovation of approach, with an emphasis on the ability  for receipt of multiple frequencies underwater.  Sources are sought for the design, development, testing and evaluation of an underwater tracking transducer.  The transducer would be able to transmit and receive multiple frequencies.  It is anticipated that testing will be accomplished by the Government, specifically NUWC Keyport and NSWC Carderock.  However, past test reports of demonstrated technical ability are encouraged but not required.  Following are desired technical characteristics:  Operating Frequencies:  The proposed multi-frequency underwater tracking transducer would be used to transmit (i.e., project) the following operating frequency ranges and frequencies: 12.9 kHz, 13.5 kHz, 75 kHz and 96 kHz.  It is desired that additional transmit frequencies include 17.2 kHz and 37 kHz.  The transducer would be used to receive the following operating frequency range: 16 kHz to 21 kHz.  Bandwidth:  The transducer will have a 3 kHz bandwidth centered at the operating frequ!  encies for 12.9 kHz and 13.5 kHz, and an 8 kHz bandwidth centered at the operating frequencies for 75 kHz and 96 kHz.  Additional desired operating frequencies of 17.2 kHz and 37 kHz will have 3.5 kHz and 5 kHz bandwidths centered at the desired operating frequencies, respectively.  Transmit Voltage Response:  The transmitting constant voltage response will be flat within + or - 3 dB within bandwidths and frequency ranges.  It is desired this response be flat within + or - 2 dB.  Directivity Beam Patterns:  The transmitting directivity response will be a hemi-spherical pattern.  The beam pattern for lower frequencies (i.e., 12.9 kHz, 13.5 kHz, 17.2 kHz, and 37 kHz) will not be down more than 10 dB + or - 30 degrees from a zero degree centerline, with zero degrees pointing to the ocean floor.  Higher frequencies (i.e., 75 kHz and 96 kHz) will not be down more than 10 dB + or - 30 degrees from a + or - 90 degree centerline, with zero degrees pointing to the ocean floor (i.e.,!   side projection).  Receive Sensitivity and Pattern:  A minimum sensit ivity of -198 dBv/uPa over the entire receiving operating frequency range (16 kHz to 21 kHz).  Depth capability:  The depth capability shall be at least 3,000 feet (914 meters), 0 to 1320 psig.  Depth Sensor:  A depth sensor will be incorporated into the transducer.  A voltage regulated depth sensor using 1 mV equivalent to 1.000 FT of seawater is required.  The supply voltage for the depth sensor will be 26 VDC ± 5 percent, and the output voltage shall be isolated.  A drift rate of less than 30 mV over the life of the depth sensor is required, which suggests micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology used with piezoresistive silicon that is micro-machined.  Initial tests by the U.S. Navy have proven this type of sensor produces extremely high levels of stability and repeatability across the entire pressure range.  Weight:  The maximum dry weight will be less than 25 lbs (11 kg mass).  Size, Shape and Mounting:  The free stream drag force on the transducer at 25 knot!  s is ~800 lbs, and the dynamic load profile needs to be minimized.  Provide the minimum envelope and shape of the proposed transducer.  Various mounting plates and brackets are intended for use, although the initial mounting plate for the transducer can be adjusted to allow for part of the transducer to be recessed within the ship’s structure.  Connectivity:  It is desired the proposed transducer connects to existing cabling.  Most existing underwater tracking system configurations use a 4-conductor cable, only 3 conductors are used for signals and the 4th conductor isn’t used since the shield is connected through the 4th pin of the 4-pin mating connectors.  One frequently used underwater tracking system configuration has the capability and existing cabling of 7-conductor cable, only 6 conductors are used for signals and the 7th conductor isn’t used since the shield is connected through the 7th pin of the 7-pin mating connectors.  Sound Pressure Level (SPL):   The transduce!  r will transmit an acoustic signal at a minimum SPL of 192 dB/uPa + or  - 1.5 dB at 1 meter over a temperature range of 2 to 30 degrees C, and over a hydrostatic pressure range of 5 psig to 1320 psig. In-Air Operation:  The transducer will be capable of being driven in-air for four hours at an operational duty cycle of two pulses per second, with each pulse having a duration of 50 ms, + or - 5 ms.  Input Power:  The maximum input power level will be less than 225 Wrms in the operating band of frequencies.  Input Impedance:  The tuned input impedance of the transducer shall be optional to the extent that the resistive component value may be designed to meet one of the following three design constraints: 20 + or - 5 ohms, 50 + or - 5 ohms, 125 + or - 10 ohms or 200 + or - 15 ohms, with a desired reactive component that will cause a maximum phase angle deviation of 20 degrees over the operating frequency.  Similar Equipment:  The salient performance characteristics of ITC-1147 underwater tracking transducer are a good reference for the transmitted!   75 kHz operating frequency, and receive operating frequency range 16 kHz to 21 kHz.  Submit pricing information separately, with unit and extended pricing information provided for a test unit of up to 2 each multi frequency underwater tracking transducers.  NUWC Division Keyport anticipates awarding up to a maximum of $50K in awards, issued on a firm fixed price, bilateral purchase order basis.  Proposals may be accepted, and awards made resulting from this announcement, through 26 May 2007. No minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed.

<SUBJECT>20--PROVIDE LUBE OIL POLISHING UNIT FOR THE FAIRBANKS MORSE OPPOSED PISTON  (38ND 8 1/8) DIESEL ENGINE.
<SOLNBR>N6554006SCAM1
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>07302006
<CONTACT>Steven Kovacs, Code 931, (215)897-1144, email: Stephen.N.Kovacs@navy.mil
<DESC>NAVSEA Philadelphia, PA is seeking expressions of interest, general information and data from potential sources to demonstrate the capability to provide a Lube Oil Polishing Unit for the Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston (38ND 8 1/8) diesel engine. After an evaluation of the submittals is complete, the Navy may select one or more systems for further development and potential procurement of 48 systems. The Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston (38ND 8 1/8) diesel engine is used as the prime mover for the Ship Service Diesel Generators (SSDG) on LSD-41/49 Class ships. The lube oil system has been a constant source of concern for these engines and has been very labor intensive to maintain due to the lack of a lube oil polishing system. The oil filters currently in use on LSD-41/49 Class SSDGs only capture contaminant particles 25 microns and larger. The Navy is seeking a lube oil polishing unit that is capable of removing carbon soot, combustion byproducts and water from the engine lube oil. The primary goal of the lube oil polishing unit is to eliminate solid particle contaminants in the 5-25 micron range and remove water from the engine lube oil down to a level of 0.05 percent by volume or less. The Navy estimates that a SSDG kidney loop sump to sump lube oil polishing unit will eliminate up to 2-3 lube oil changes per year therefore potentially doing away with four overhauls a y!  ear fleet wide. Specific requirements for the SSDG Lube Oil Polishing Unit are as follows: 1.Must be a permanently installed, skid mounted, kidney loop sump to sump system consisting of a pump, motor, controller, contaminant removal media, liquid removal media, power supply, valves and piping. 2.Capable of being installed on U.S. Navy Vessels (LSD-41/49 Class). 3.Capable of processing commercial SAB 40 lube oil with a temperature range of 50-225	degrees Fahrenheit. 4.Must be capable of operating independently of the diesel engine. 5.Capable of purifying the diesel engine sump, approximately 1000 gallons, a minimum four times a day (A 70 GPH capacity). 6.Must meet Grade B shock qualification. 7.Must fit within an approximate 4ft X 4fi X 5ft space with size and weight kept to a minimum and center of gravity placed as low as possible. 8.Solid contaminant removal media shall be capable of removing soot and other solid contaminants from the lube oil down to a level of 5 microns or smaller. 9.Liquid contaminant removal media shall be capable of removing water and other liquid contaminants from the engine lube oil down to a level of 0.05 percent by volume or less. 10.Capable of withstanding environmental conditions found in a U.S. Navy marine application, heat limitations and susceptibility to corrosion. The Navy is seeking to identify promising commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies that would yield a significant reduction of lube oil solid and liquid contamination with the aforementioned diesel engine. Those lube oil polishing system manufacturers possessing such technologies can inform the Navy by providing the following information no later than 30 June 2006. Submissions for this announcement shall include the following information: 1.Past experience with similar type of lube oil polishing system including details of the system, the customer, how many systems were built, the cost of the systems, warranties and customer POC’s including phone numbers. 2.An estimate of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of the lube oil polishing unit including procurement, installation, maintenance, parts support, training, upgrades and improvements expected over a 25 year life expectancy. 3.Demonstrated reliability, projected Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of similar applications. 4.Estimates for lube oil polishing system cost, weight (lb.), dimensions (ft.) and manufacturing lead-time. 5.Technical capabilities to design, manufacture, test, maintain and overhaul lube oil polishing system components. 6.Logistic capability for the development of technical manuals, maintenance procedures, drawings and parts/material support. 7.Name of manufacturer and source of origin for major components. 8.Applicable laboratory test data (performance, reliability, maintenance, and durability) of similar applications. 9.Materials list. 10.Maintenance requirements. 11.Disposal and handling of hazardous material requirements. 12.An analysis of the projected obsolescence of component parts and their impact on operation and maintenance. This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this announcement nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (U.S.M.C.) is seeking information regarding the availability of fabric that satisfies the Government's requirements as described below and in the attached documents .  This notice is constitutes a Request for Information only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time. BACKGROUND: USMC is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of commercial or modified commercial products with flame resistance/non melt/non drip, improved wet weather protection, improved manual dexterity/tactility, and grip, and improved durability compared to the USMC's current glove systems for ground combat use in temperate and cold conditions.  One system, the Combat Utility Glove (CUG) System, is intended to replace two of USMC's current systems to include the leather work glove/knit wool insert  and insulated glove system for cold weather. The second system, the Extreme Cold Weather (ECW) Mitten System, is intended to replace the current USMC insulated trigger finger mitten system for cold weather.  After review and evaluation of industry's submi ssions, the most promising candidate components may be procured for FY07 Marine fielding testing to determine if it warrants Marine Corps adoption. DESCRIPTION:  The Marine Corps seeks products that meet the component requirements of the two glove systems outlined. (1) The USMC CUG system consists of a shell and light utility glove liner.  CUG shell must be able to be worn alone or with the liner, provide flame resistance and non-melt/non-drip properties, good manual dexterity/tactility and grip better or e qual to the current, be waterproof yet breathable, have good durability to be used for heavy utility work including cut and abrasion resistance, will not freeze, good colorfastness to prevent dye transfer to hands, and a gauntlet length equal to the curren t (approx 1 1/2 inches).  Basis of issue (BOI) will be 1 per Marine. CUG liner must be able to be worn alone or with the shell, provide flame resistance and non-melt/non-drip properties, have very good manual dexterity/tactility and grip, be water resistan t as well as fast drying, have good durability for light utility work to handle and manipulate smooth and rough objects, provide insulation for intermediate cold weather, will not freeze, have good colorfastness to prevent dye transfer to hands, and a gaun tlet length equal to the current (approx 3 inches).  BOI will be 2 per Marine. Up to 2 CUG systems may be tested based upon component submissions.   One candidate liner has already been selected; we will therefore be seeking up to 1 candidate liner.  If te sting supports the adoption of CUG, it would be a system issued to every Marine from USMC Central Issue Facilities (CIF's). CIF full stock level is 206,000 systems (consisting of 1 shell/2liners).  The quantity USMC would procure would be dependent on the phase in plan and available funding.  (2) The USMC ECW Mitten System consists of a waterproof mitten shell, insulated mitten liners, and a contact glove.  The Marine Corps has selected the mitten shell and liner candidate and one of two contact gloves for testing.  We will therefore be seeking up to 1 candidate contact glove.  This market survey seeks a traditional contact glove candidate as part of the ECW Mitten System and must provide maximum dexterity/tactility and grip, be form fitting, have non-melt/n on-drip properties, be fast drying, have a minimum gauntlet length of approximately 3 inches, prevent hands from freezing to metal, and provide protection from hot objects.  BOI will be 3 per Marine.  If testing supports adoption of the USMC ECW Mitten Sys tem, it would be issued as organizational equipment from USMC Special Training Allowance Pool (STAP) as required for unit training and deployment.  The minimum STAP stock level will be 20,000 systems (consisting of 1 shell/2insu lated liners/1-3 contact gloves) and long term 40,000 systems dependent on phase in plan and available funding. GLOVE CANDIDATES:  The Government requests interested suppliers identify gloves that are within their existing product line production capabilit ies, or can be easily modified to meet the required salient characteristics. Suppliers may submit one or more component; CUG shells, CUG liners and ECW Mitten contact gloves, or CUG system.    To respond to this RFI, interested suppliers are REQUIRED to su bmit the following for each candidate to enable the Government to efficiently evaluate the viability and benefit of your proposed glove for the development of 2 USMC Glove Systems.  Information will be handled as proprietary and samples will not be returne d.  (1) Submissions must be labeled for the component that it is being recommended it fulfills. (2) Material Description, and if glove component is or could be Berry compliant if adopted.  The supplier must identify the requirements it meets. If a supplier  submits multiple products to fulfill a component, they must identify the advantage/disadvantage of competing products. (3) Provide estimated unit cost per pair. (4) Submit 5 pairs (in any color or print on hand) of various sizes including MED and LRG. (5)  Describe other attributes that may not be apparent from material description provided and visual inspection of gloves. Initial samples submitted by interested suppliers are due NLT 23 June 2006 for Marine Corps review.  If the Marine Corps is interested i n further evaluating a glove submission, the Government will procure additional samples for testing within 15 - 30 calendar days after initial submission.  The Government expects to complete its detailed laboratory screening evaluation and select candidate  gloves by 1 Sep 06 for delivery by 1 Nov 2006 in tan.  Tan is the color which has been chosen to identify USMC handwear as FR/non-melt/drip.  If the Marine Corps selects gloves for field testing, it is anticipated approximately 1,000 CUG Shells each (up t o 2 candidates) 2,000 CUG Liners (1 candidate), and 12,000 contact gloves (1 candidate) will be procured.  Delivery of the contact glove will be needed by 1 Nov.  Delivery of CUG components are desired by 1 Nov but required NLT 1 Dec 06.

<SUBJECT>83--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: FABRIC FOR USMC MOUNTAIN CAMMIE
<SOLNBR>W911QY06T0041
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>08292006
<CONTACT>Kevin Parker, 508-233-5937
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (U.S.M.C.) is seeking information regarding the availability of fabric that satisfies the Government's requirements as described below and in the attached documents .  This notice is constitutes a Request for Information only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time. BACKGROUND: USMC is developing a combat uniform specifically for mountain operations referred herein as Mountain Cammies.  The Mountain Cammies will NOT replace the Marine Corps' current 50% Nylon/50% Cotton twill Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU).  The purp ose of the Mountain Cammie is to provide durability of MCCUU while significantly decreasing drying time once wet, increasing wind resistance, and including design features needed for mountain operations.  MARCORSYSCOM proved out the concept and the benefit  of a specific Mountain Cammie in Winter 2005 field testing and now must find optimized fabric and garment design to complete it's development.  The developmental Mountain Cammie will be evaluated in field validation testing winter/spring 2007 for user acc eptance.    Once approved by Program Manager-Infantry Combat Equipment (PM-ICE), the Mountain Cammie will be issued as organizational equipment from USMC Special Training Allowance Pool (STAP) as required for unit training and deployment.  While the maximu m STAP stock level has yet to be established, MARCORSYSCOM estimates the initial operational capability at a minimum of 33,000 cammie sets (blouse and trouser) up to 116,00 maximum with an estimated 3,000 -5,000 sets for an annual peace-time sustainment. Once a suitable the Mountain Cammie is adopted, MARCORSYSCOM intends to buy the initial capability of 33,000 sets in FY07 if funds are available.  MARCORSYSCOM anticipates an additional 2 years may be required to reach the maximum STAP level (to be establi shed) depending on the availability of funds.  FABRIC CANDIDATES:  The Government requests interested suppliers identify fabrics that are within their existing product line production capabilities that meet the salient characteristics below. The essential characteristics for the uniform fabric are delineated in Category 1 where good tear strength durability, maximum breathability for on the move comfort, maximum wind resistance for cold weather comfort, and fast drying are the highest priorities.  Categorie s 2 and 3 build upon Category 1 requirements with enhanced characteristics if available.   To respond to this RFI, interested suppliers are REQUIRED to submit the following for each candidate fabric to enable the Government to efficiently evaluate the viab ility and benefit of your proposed fabric for Mountain Cammie development effort: (1) Furnish laboratory test data IAW the specified test methods - fill in columns to right of attached requirements. (2) Describe fabric composition and construction. (3) Pro vide estimated unit cost per linear yard (specify width). (4) Estimate number of days desert MARPAT printed and finished fabric after receipt of order (ARO). (5) Submit a 1/4 yard fabric swatch (in any color or print on hand). (6) Describe other attributes  that may not be apparent from table of data or visual inspection of cloth. Response to this RFI is 30 days.  If the Government is interested in further evaluating a fabric submission, the Government will procure sample yardage for additional testing withi n approximately 15 calendar days after initial submission.  The Government expects to complete its detailed evaluation and select a candidate fabric by 1 Aug 06. The selected fabric will be a directed source on USMC fabrication contract for test items to f abricate Mountain Cammies within 3 months desired (4 months required) for test item fabrication of 8,000 Mountain Cammie blouse and trousers each. To enable this field test, it is anticipated approximately 35,000 linear yards of  the fabric will be needed in the early fall 2006 to fabricate 8,000 each of the Mountain Cammie blouse and trouser.  USMC will share these findings with Army's Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment Gen III and Special Operations clothing developers for awareness but has no influence on current program activities. Please see attached files for salient charac teristics.  Questions concerning this RFI can be directed to Dee Townes, Project Officer, at dee.townes@natick.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- Short-term (Intermittent) Subject Matter Expert under the C-TPAT Program
<DESC>Background:     U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous industry partnership programs, domestic and international training projects in various countries throughout the world that address the entire range of customs cargo, and conveyance security operations. The purpose of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is to partner with the trade community to enhance the security of the US and the international supply chains against the possible intrusion by terrorist organizations. C-TPAT requires the trade company participant to document and validate their supply chain security procedures in relation to existing CBP-C-TPAT criteria or guidelines.  As part of the C-TPAT process, CBP C-TPAT Supply Chain Security Specialists (SCSS) and the C-TPAT participant jointly conduct a validation of the company’s supply chain security procedures. The validation process is essential to verifying the company’s commitment to C-TPAT.  To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with validations, training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.    

C-TPAT Validator:  The IC shall serve and be part of a C-TPAT team assigned to conduct supply chain security validations on companies that are part of the C-TPAT process.  This work requires extensive report writing and communications ability.  IC’s chosen for this position will be required to undergo two (2) weeks of successful C-TPAT training in Washington D.C in November 2006. Once determined to be C-TPAT validator, the IC will be assigned to one of five (5) SCSS field offices.  The IC will coordinate all work, and travel requirements from the field office and be under the direction of the field officer supervisor.  Note: There may be times when another field office requires additional assistance in performing validations.  An IC may be required to supplement the field office with his/her services.          
 
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of supply chain security, anti-terrorism measures, risk assessment, narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs, border control, or industry partnership related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP.  CBP reserves the right to cancel a contract in the event that the IC does not fully meet the expectations of the assignment.      

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP C-TPAT conducts validations. CBP C-TPAT validations are being scheduled for Brazil, Jordan/Turkey, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Mexico and Canada during 2007. This travel may at times be to high-risk locations as stated above.  As an anti-terrorism program, C-TPAT requires its Supply Chain Specialist along with the IC to travel to parts of the world that may have had past terrorist incidents.  

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment. 2) All authorized contract work will be paid at the above weekly/daily/hourly rates. There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. 3) The IC contract will include reimbursement for the required medical evacuation coverage, not to exceed $500.00, and medical examination costs up to $500.00. Immunization shots may be required for certain countries.  CPB will compensate the IC for receiving the necessary immunization.  4) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations.  
       
NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are NOT authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP Office of Cargo and Conveyance Security Division, and may not be released to any other party. 4) The relevant provision of the Trade Secrets Act reads as follows: “Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof…publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source or any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association or permits any income return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person except as provided by law shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and shall be removed from office or employment.  

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Interested individuals are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR which is available at FedBizOpps under the above Reference Number. 

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at     http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf.  Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail to the appropriate address specified in this announcement only. 

APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBP-C-TPAT.contractor@dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF.  Application material submitted to the contracting staff will not be considered or forwarded for consideration.  No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION: The CBP Office of Cargo and Conveyance Security Division will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and awarded a contract for one or more assignments in the future. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00).

CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at     http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The contract document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. 

NOTE: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at     www.ccr.gov     prior to issuance of a contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number.

Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept the contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract when the required assignment requirements are fulfilled, but no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the contract document. IC invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor.     

NOTE: This announcement is not an offer of employment. This Notice is being published on an annual basis and supersedes previous notices for intermittent contractors issued by CBP. This Notice remains in affect until canceled or superseded. Applicants must realize that CBP requirements for the services described above occur on a sporadic basis and there is no assurance or guarantee that they will receive a contract for the services described herein.

<SUBJECT>--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  FABRIC FOR USMC MOUNTAIN CAMMIE
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (U.S.M.C.) is seeking information regarding the availability of fabric that satisfies the Government's requirements as described below and in the attached documents .  This notice is constitutes a Request for Information only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time. BACKGROUND: USMC is developing a combat uniform specifically for mountain operations referred herein as Mountain Cammies.  The Mountain Cammies will NOT replace the Marine Corps' current 50% Nylon/50% Cotton twill Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU).  The purp ose of the Mountain Cammie is to provide durability of MCCUU while significantly decreasing drying time once wet, increasing wind resistance, and including design features needed for mountain operations.  MARCORSYSCOM proved out the concept and the benefit  of a specific Mountain Cammie in Winter 2005 field testing and now must find optimized fabric and garment design to complete it's development.  The developmental Mountain Cammie will be evaluated in field validation testing winter/spring 2007 for user acc eptance.    Once approved by Program Manager-Infantry Combat Equipment (PM-ICE), the Mountain Cammie will be issued as organizational equipment from USMC Special Training Allowance Pool (STAP) as required for unit training and deployment.  While the maximu m STAP stock level has yet to be established, MARCORSYSCOM estimates the initial operational capability at a minimum of 33,000 cammie sets (blouse and trouser) up to 116,00 maximum with an estimated 3,000 -5,000 sets for an annual peace-time sustainment. Once a suitable the Mountain Cammie is adopted, MARCORSYSCOM intends to buy the initial capability of 33,000 sets in FY07 if funds are available.  MARCORSYSCOM anticipates an additional 2 years may be required to reach the maximum STAP level (to be establi shed) depending on the availability of funds.  FABRIC CANDIDATES:  The Government requests interested suppliers identify fabrics that are within their existing product line production capabilities that meet the salient characteristics below. The essential characteristics for the uniform fabric are delineated in Category 1 where good tear strength durability, maximum breathability for on the move comfort, maximum wind resistance for cold weather comfort, and fast drying are the highest priorities.  Categorie s 2 and 3 build upon Category 1 requirements with enhanced characteristics if available.   To respond to this RFI, interested suppliers are REQUIRED to submit the following for each candidate fabric to enable the Government to efficiently evaluate the viab ility and benefit of your proposed fabric for Mountain Cammie development effort: (1) Furnish laboratory test data IAW the specified test methods - fill in columns to right of attached requirements. (2) Describe fabric composition and construction. (3) Pro vide estimated unit cost per linear yard (specify width). (4) Estimate number of days desert MARPAT printed and finished fabric after receipt of order (ARO). (5) Submit a 1/4 yard fabric swatch (in any color or print on hand). (6) Describe other attributes  that may not be apparent from table of data or visual inspection of cloth. Response to this RFI is 30 days.  If the Government is interested in further evaluating a fabric submission, the Government will procure sample yardage for additional testing withi n approximately 15 calendar days after initial submission.  The Government expects to complete its detailed evaluation and select a candidate fabric by 1 Aug 06. The selected fabric will be a directed source on USMC fabrication contract for test items to f abricate Mountain Cammies within 3 months desired (4 months required) for test item fabrication of 8,000 Mountain Cammie blouse and trousers each. To enable this field test, it is anticipated approximately 35,000 linear yards of  the fabric will be needed in the early fall 2006 to fabricate 8,000 each of the Mountain Cammie blouse and trouser.  USMC will share these findings with Army's Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment Gen III and Special Operations clothing developers for awareness but has no influence on current program activities. Please see attached files for salient charac teristics.  Questions concerning this RFI can be directed to Dee Townes, Project Officer, at dee.townes@natick.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20060519.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3728, FSC Code is 1680 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.  NAICS is 336413.
This acquisition is for Brand Name or Equal  items only and is not a small business set-aside.    This Brand Name or Equal  purchase will be for a total of the following upgrade items for three cockpit displays for the F-35 aircraft. 
Brand Name  or Equal Justification Information:


1.	The Electronic Warfare (EW) Directorate requests the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of Driven Technologies, Inc. F-35 Panoramic Cockpit Display (PCD).

2.	The Driven Technologies  F-35 PCDs will be direct replacements for the existing PCDs currently in use in the F-35 Manned Flight Simulators.  The new Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) PCDs represent significant advances in performance over the older projection type currently in use. The salient functional characteristics that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Directorate are: 

•	Must meet current Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed Martin (LM) requirements in support of the current A.4 Program Introduction Document.
•	The units are currently in use at PAX River and the LM Ft. Worth Verification Simulator (VSIM) labs. 
•	Units are designed to accommodate the LM specified glare shield and front instrumentation panel.
•	Units support symbology gain and brightness control

3.	Currently the Driven Technologies LCD display is the only known brand of this type of technology currently being used by LM.  Since LM is driving the requirements for the government support facilities it is currently the only known brand that can meet the Electronic Warfare Directorates requirement.  

4.	Since LM drives the system requirements for the government support facilities and we are obligated by the A.4 PID to replicate the VSIM labs as much as possible there is very little we can do in preventing brand name situations in the future.

 
Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required equipment.  FOB Destination is the Government preferred method of shipping.  Please submit FOB Destination shipping information with all submittals to the office.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.  
52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds transfer payment.  Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) completed-- http://orca.bpn.gov/.  FOR MPIN REGISTRATION: http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp.   Use of online representations & certifications application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 January 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online. Representations and certifications are to be completed at least annually by vendors on-line through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor representations and certifications that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation-specific representations and certifications may still be used outside of ORCA.  Further information on this initiative may be obtained from the  ORCA help menu, http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA Handbook.

DESC:The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, This acquisition is a total small business set aside.  The NAICS code is 541710. The following items will be procured:
 
The following item will be procured: BACKGROUND: A new closed-circuit subsonic research wind tunnel is being purchased by the Air Force (AF) at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) to be installed at the California State Polytechnic University (Cal Poly Pomona or CPP) campus in Pomona, California. The facility will be a weather-proof outdoor-type wind tunnel installed on an existing concrete slab. The test section area of the wind tunnel will be enclosed in a pre-engineered metal control room with an approximate interior size of 20’ x 30’. The tunnel will have a test section size of 28"H x 40"W x 78"L with a centerline 5’ above the floor. The maximum dynamic pressure of the tunnel will be 90 psf.

Please see the site layout at:
http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/

DESCRIPTION: The Air Force requires a model support and positioning system, 2 internal force balances and a data acquisition and control system for the new wind tunnel test facility. The contractor shall design, manufacture, deliver, install, demonstrate and document this equipment as specified.

MODEL SUPPORT AND POSITIONING SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
A computer- and manually-controlled motorized, 2-DOF model support and positioning system to position a sting-mounted model in pitch and yaw. A 3rd DOF in roll shall be controlled manually (non-motorized).

Range, Accuracy and Resolution: Minimum range of +35 to -10 degrees in pitch and +25 to -25 degrees in yaw and to within 1/10 of a degree in accuracy. The roll component shall also be displayed and recorded. The resolution of all position displays shall be a minimum of 1/10 of a degree.

Position Control and Display: Motorized position shall be controlled both manually and by computer for Pitch and Yaw. Position of all 3 DOF shall be displayed simultaneously by the computer and an analog digital display to the accuracy and resolution listed above. The transition between manual to computer and computer to manual shall be “bumpless”. The manual control and digital display panel shall be located near the test section. The switches, knobs, or other controls shall position the model in pitch and yaw to within the stated range and accuracy and the displays shall indicate pitch, yaw and roll at a minimum of the stated accuracy and resolution.

Center of Rotation: The center of rotation of the pitch and yaw motions must be positioned at the virtual center of the test section which is 39 inches downstream end of the test section, 14 inches above the test section floor and 20 inches from the test section windows. The floor of the wind tunnel will accommodate a slotted, circular aluminum plate with a 45 inch diameter and 1/2 inch thickness, which will be provided under this contract.

Load Capability: The load capability of the motor drive and support system corresponds to the typical loads for the Six-Component Balance.

•	Normal Force	±300 lbs
•	Side Force	±100 lbs
•	Axial Force	±40 lbs
•	Pitching Moment	±400 in-lbs
•	Yawing Moment	±200 in-lbs
•	Rolling Moment	±200 in-lbs

There shall be minimal backlash, vibration, and no unintentional positional changes within the mechanism during operation. Deflection shall be minimal in all directions when the maximum loads are applied. Resultant deflections caused by loads applied at the wind tunnel virtual center shall be documented for angle correction purposes. These deflections shall be documented for at least 5 points in all 3 DOF based on balance load ranges. Model position motor overload protection shall also be provided.

Motor and Controller Noise
The motors and controllers shall not emit acoustical or electrical noise which may affect sensitive instrumentation and signal wiring mounted to or located near the support and positioning system, and the wind tunnel test section.

Motors and motors controller shall be on a separate circuit, fed from an isolation transformer.  This isolation transformer shall be on an independent feed from the instrumentation isolation transformer that will supply the 120 VAC 60 Hz nominal voltage for the instrumentation and computer systems within the control room.

Motor leads should be housed in rigid conduit that is electrically bonded, section to section to motor, to reduce electrical noise radiation. The use of “smart motors” with an Ethernet interface should be considered.

Materials and Surface Finishes: All materials must have sufficient mechanical properties to withstand the maximum model loads and dampen any vibration through the concrete slab from the wind tunnel circuit and the tunnel fan and motor located nearby. All materials shall resist or be coated to resist surface and base metal corrosion.

<DESC>This amendment to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092 provides the results of the Industry Day held at TSA HQ on 5/24/06.  Below you will find a list of all questions asked and their answers. Additionally, if you would like a copy of the Industry Day sign-in sheet and the Industry Day PowerPoint presentation, you may contact Robyn King at robyn.king@dhs.gov or Marvin Grubbs at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov no later than 7 June 2006 at 2:00pm EST.  

Any additional questions submitted in writing to the primary or secondary POC will collectively be posted 14 June 2006 via FedBizOpps.

The following are the questions and answers from Industry Day.  

1.  Regarding the incumbent, what contract vehicle is currently in place?

Currently a GSA Task Order off the MOBIS schedule is in place and is priced per deliverable.  It has been decided that pricing per deliverable was a difficult way to manage this contract.

2.  Are security clearances required for this contract?

This is a subject that is always changing at TSA because of the changing processes with the Department of Defense. We will not require a secret or top secret clearance, but all personnel will need to have a favorable adjudicated background check before the period of performance begins. 

3.  Regarding past performance references, is it required that 3 references are provided for each company, including team members or subcontractors, or 3 references total?

We ask for a minimum of three (3) past performance references total, but you may provide as many as you would like for each team member or subcontractor.  Please ensure you are providing enough applicable information. If bidders receive a negative past performance reference, the offeror will be given the chance to rebut.

4.  In regard to the staffing requirements of the team lead, can this person be a CSP or CIH?  

Either one is acceptable, but it is emphasized that the team lead must meet all qualifications that are imposed by the qualifying board.

5.  In regard to 15% of work being performed by a small business as a team member or subcontractor, what standards are to be followed to ensure a business falls under the particular small business standard?

If an offeror plans to use/or is a small business, use of 15% or more work by a small business under this contract will be considered an evaluation strength.  To ensure the business is considered small, offerers will need to check the small business standards listed under the particular NAICS code.

6.  Are there contractor personnel in place at the Mission Support Centers now?

Yes there are.  TSA currently has 5 mission support centers (MSCs) located in Philadelphia; Atlanta; Irving, TX; Troy, MI; and San Bruno, CA.  Two are GSA leased space and the other three are leased through a contractor.  

7.  Are all positions for the OSH support service filled by this contract?

Yes.

8.  Will TSA be supplying facility space or is the contractor responsible for providing space for its personnel?

TSA has limited space available at the MSCs (2 spaces). The contractor may propose utilization of these provided spaces or may propose using its own spaces in support of the requirement.  TSA will provide laptops and VPN capability to field personnel.  The majority of this contract is travel based; therefore little time will be spent in an office or fixed facility.  The contractor would have the ability to use those workstations and rotate staff throughout.

9.  Are Representations and Certifications required for subcontractors/ team members as well as the prime?

No, Reps and Certs need only be provided for the prime under privity of contract.  But, remember that we have required the use of ORCA; therefore you can ask subcontractors and team members to use ORCA as well.  The DUNS for the all parties would be required in order to validate the information.

10.  Information Given:

There is no TSA supervision over contractor personnel located at the MSCs.  Therefore, it is expected that personnel will uphold a professional standard at all times.

11.  Are there individual Safety Action Teams (SATs) located at each airport?  Can you give an estimate of the number of SATs TSA has in place?

There are approximately 130 SATs active across the country.  SATs are an important aspect of the OSHE office functioning as a bridge between the workforce and leadership. Some SATs are dynamic and integrated while some exist in name only.  SATs are critical to the success of the OSH program. The contractor must be able to provide leadership, regardless of how much hand holding the individual offices need.

On the other hand, management support in the field is easy to find.  The security of our aviation program is pretty well in place and therefore it is time for the field management to examine safety and other employee issues.  In this aspect management has been very responsive.  

12.  Last year a contract was awarded for safety ergonomics, what is the relationship between that contract and this one?  

The contract that was awarded was for job hazard analysis, which included an aspect of ergonomics, but was not specifically focused on safety ergonomics.  As stated in the presentation, that contract provides support to visit each airport once to perform a hazard inspection and analysis and establish a baseline.   A repeat hazard analysis would only be necessary if the operations were significantly changed.

13.  Information Given:

An attachment in Section J describes the different categories of airports and the requirements of each category.

Originally mandated by Congress to see if using Federal screeners or private screeners are better, the current SPP program allows airports to opt out and use private contractors that have been vetted by TSA. Airports submit proposals on how they would provide better security screeners for approval by TSA.  Currently there are six airports that participate in the SPP program.  Also, some of the smaller airports have not been federalized yet; meaning they do not have TSA screeners or may only operate on a seasonal basis.  Because of the options for airports, the number of airports listed on the given attachment is an estimate and may change over the life of this contract.  

14.  Does this contract cover the privatized airports?

No, we provide oversight but TSA does not control the workforce, therefore we are not responsible for implementing or managing their programs. They are responsible for managing the program themselves.  This contract provides support on OSH issues related to space occupied by the FSD and the FSD staff.

15.  Are the airports broken down by regions or sizes?

The airports are distributed among three regions; East, Central and Western. Airports are also classified by category, as listed in the provided attachment.  Note:  In the past TSA hubs and spokes crossed state boundaries, but they have been reorganized to follow state and regional lines.

16.  Are TSA’s regions the same as FAA’s?

No, FAA uses different distinctions.  TSA previously had 5 airport regions but has recently been reorganized to 3 areas.  
	
17.  Information Given:

OMB initiative has found that only about 58 airports are creating 80% of the injury claims reported by DOL.  Categories III and IVs have their own unique problems, but the large Category X airports are the focus at this point in time.  New technology that is initiated in the larger airports is usually pushed out into the smaller airports with time.  Smaller airports don’t have the needed technology and therefore many of the Transportation Security Officers are physically handling baggage.  Technology doesn’t necessarily solve all safety issues though, because any bag that causes an alarm still is required to be picked up and inspected.  Also we need to emphasize the importance of face to face training when possible since there are some things that just aren’t learned through online training.

Any persons found not using seatbelts, as required by Montana law, while operating or riding in a motor vehicle on Malmstrom Air Force Base shall be subject to established base policy suspensions.  In addition, all vehicle operators, both military and civilian, driving personal or government-owned vehicles on Malmstrom AFB are prohibited from using a cell phone unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  Also, the wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB is prohibited.  Violation of this policy may affect your driving privileges, as each violation will result in the loss of three (3) points.

Additionally, any persons found speeding while operating a motor vehicle on Malmstrom AFB shall be subject to the same suspensions.  Repeated offenses will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on the Contractor’s ability to perform agreement requirements.

1.7.	INVOICES AND PAYMENTS.  The Contractor shall submit invoices by the 10th of each month for services rendered the previous month.  Invoices will be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer.  

1.8.	PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.  The contractor must identify a Project Manager and alternate who is able to address issues and concerns that may arise during the performance of this agreement.
