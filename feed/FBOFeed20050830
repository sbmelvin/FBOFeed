<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Prevention
(CSAP), through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM),
Program Support Center(PSC), is planning to award a 12 month
contract using simplified acquisition procedures, to the
AFFNA DEA Museum Foundation, 200 Army Navy Drive, Arlington,
VA 22202.  The anticipated date of award is September
15, 2005.

SAMHSA/CSAP is looking for new and creative venues to educate children and their families with important prevention messages regarding drugs and drug abuse.  As an original partner in the development of the DEA museum, SAMHSA/CSAP believes the museum reaches a broad population, especially children and their parents, as well as educators and students, with vital messages regarding the consequences of drug abuse on individuals, families and society.

In order to infuse a balance between the supply and demand reduction focus in the “Target America” exhibit, SAMHSA/CSAP will enter into a contract to:

Display and distribute prevention-oriented exhibit materials as follows:

Develop and print prevention materials that are aligned with the themes of the exhibit, including lesson plans, training guides, CD-ROMs and fact sheets for distribution to both large-scale visitor audiences and specialty groups including teachers, counselors, prevention specialists and parents who attend the exhibit.

Distribute SAMHSA/CSAP materials already in print appropriate to the exhibit

Develop and provide prevention-oriented training programs to be hosted at the exhibit venue for individuals and organizations that provide drug abuse prevention education in public and private schools and other venues in the region.

Ship the exhibit from Detroit, Michigan to the new venue in Ohio; unpack and assemble the exhibit in Ohio for use as SAMHSA/CSAP’s launch site for the 2005 Red Ribbon Campaign.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 5.201(b)(1).  In accordance with FAR
19.502-2(a), the contracting officer has determined that there
is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or
more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in
terms of market price, quality and delivery; Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Prevention
(CSAP), through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM),
Program Support Center(PSC), is planning to award a 12 month
contract using simplified acquisition procedures, to the
Altam Associates, Inc., 9715 Carroll Centre Road, Suite 104,
San Diego, CA 92126.  The anticipated date of award is September
15, 2005.

A stated SAMHSA goal is to expand the number of programs approved through the NREP process.  It benefits SAMHSA to enlist programs, especially ones that are showing successful outcomes, to organize and submit their previously-collected data according to NREP criteria so they can enter and move through the NREP process.  Taking such strategies to scale and replicating them nationally strengthens the national substance abuse prevention effort.

Current research suggests that early intervention is more effective clinically and much more cost efficient than the traditional, more intensive treatment necessary if the use progresses to addiction.

As part of its prevention mission, SAMHSA seeks to validate effective programs that will intervene with substance use as early as possible, and seeks to make them nationally available through the NREP process.  While the CASBIRT program,  is funded as acooperative agreement through SAMHSA/CSAT, it cannot be made available for national dissemination until it completes the NREP process.

The contractor shall produce the following:

A guide for set-up and implementation of a comprehensive SBIRT system that focuses on the nondependent user.   At a minimum, the guide will include; Setting up the basic structure of SBIRT; Personnel and training requirements; Clinical protocols; Quality control; Technology requirements; Partnering with the local community Cross-cultural guidelines; Measuring success;

All publications produced under contract with Federal funding are considered in the public domain and not the property of the organization that produces them.  Publications must be processed through the DHHS Publications Clearance process.

Two reports based on the NREP criteria as follows:

An objective analysis of all previously-collected data regarding the CASBIRT program; a summary report of evaluation findings regarding the CASBIRT program

Work plan outlining guide for set-up and implementation of a comprehensive SBIRT system as described in statement of work
including timelines to Project Officer due two months after award

Prototype of guide for set-up and implementation of a comprehensive SBIRT system to Project Officer due six months after award

Final report indicating lessons learned and recommendations for future action to Project Officer nine months after award

An objective analysis of all previously-collected data regarding the CASBIRT program to Project Officer twelve months after award

A summary report of evaluation findings regarding the CASBIRT program to Project Officer due twelve months after award

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 5.201(b)(1).  In accordance with FAR
19.502-2(a), the contracting officer has determined that there

<DESC>The purpose of this project/task order is to develop a listing of preliminary business contracts (leads) established by the TIC or its designated contractor into full blown business opportunities.  The TIC may choose to hire a business analysis consultant to perform market research and business planning.  Any business contracts (leads) identified under that business planning effort would then be utilized by this project/task order for further development into true business opportunities. The goal of this project/task order is to increase the number of business opportunities available to the TIC and thereby to increase the current work efforts of the various TIC business areas.  While potential customers can include any commercial or DoD entity, there is a desire to target the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. State Department for the potential use of TIC services.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-42 Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (CBMANET); CLOSING DATE: September 19, 2006; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12 noon, November 2, 2005; Eastern Standard Time (EST). Point of Contact:  J. Christopher Ramming, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA05-42@darpa.mil; Web site: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/CBMANET/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals for the Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Program (CBMANET).

The objective of the Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (CBMANET) program is to research, design, develop and evaluate a revolutionary Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) prototype that improves effective performance from network stakeholder (user and operator) perspectives by an order of magnitude or more relative to the state of the art. In particular, proposals are sought to develop software implementing a revolutionary CBMANET network stack and services. This software will be subject to independent test and evaluation by a government team, using a rigorous comparison against a baseline MANET representative of the state of the art. In Phase 1, performers must deliver high-fidelity models of that software for evaluation using government-specified scenarios and applications. In Phase 2, performers must deliver an integrated software/hardware solution for field demonstrations and evaluation. Specifically, the integrated solution will consist of the performer software, a computing platform of the performer’s choice, a specified GFE physical layer (PHY), and a suitably equipped GFE field vehicle.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA05-42) on or before 12 Noon, November 2, 2005, Eastern Standard Time (EST). 

ELIGIBILITY: This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Laws, other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances, and other caveats identified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. Therefore, in order of importance, the technical evaluation criteria include: (a) Innovative Technical Approach; (b) System Architecture; (c) Security and Survivability (d) Management Approach and Past Experience; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (f) Cost Realism. For the purpose of award under this BAA, the technical evaluation criteria are more important than cost.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including Proposers’ Day registration procedures, and instructions on how to respond.

Note:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT INSTEAD ADDRESS ALL INQUIRIES AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is CT1745-05 and is issued as a Request For Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.   This requirement is a 100% set aside exclusively for small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 333298 and small business size standard is 500.   UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., intends to enter into a firm-fixed price definite delivery/definite quantity type contract for various equipment. The period of performance for this requirement is 120 days.  Delivery is required 60 days after receipt of delivery order.

THE QUANTITY AND LINE ITEM DESCRIPTIONS ARE STATED IN SECTION B OF THE SOLICITATION.  (REFER TO SECTION B OF THE SOLICITATION)


Machines are to be set up, sewn off, and tested prior to shipping.  All machines shall be complete with table, motor & stand.  Packaging of all machines should be, at a minimum, screwed/strapped down to the shipping pallet and shrink wrapped.  Each machine shall include a sew-off sample to be evaluated upon delivery of the machine.

THIS REQUIREMENT MAY RESULT IN A MULTIPLE AWARD.  THIS IS A BRAND NAME OR EQUAL REQUIREMENT.

The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:

52.204-6, Contractor Identification Number Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS);
	
52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration;

52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal;
     	
52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial;

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, Significant evaluation factors are past performance, ability to conform to the specifications, and price.  Past performance is significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government may make award without discussions - therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain offeror's best pricing.   Tradeoff Process: It may be in the Government's best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal if the perceived benefits of the highest priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.;

52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Representations and certifications by logging onto  http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process.   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.


52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; (PARAGRAPH (D) “DISPUTES”, REPLACE WITH THE FOLLOWING: 52.233-1 Disputes (October 2003) (DEVIATION)

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
       (f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractors receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractors appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractors receipt of an adverse Contracting Officers decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractors request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractors request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officers decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.  Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
       (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Procurement action being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. The National Nuclear Security Administration Service Center (NNSA SC) intends to award a sole-source commercial purchase order with small business, Star Quest Recording Studios, Inc., 6538 E. 31st, Tulsa, OK 74145, for the following items:  4 units, Battle Effects Fog Engine, 2 Cases (4 gallons) each of Blinding White Fog Engine Fuel and Battle Field Fog Engine Fuel, and MSDS for the Fog Engine Fuels. Star Quest is the only US manufacturer of a continuous output, weather-proof fog machine that produces high masking fog, safe for humans and the environment. The Star Quest Fog Engine provides the following necessary requirements under battlefield conditions: To continuously (from a few minutes to an hour or more) deploy the obscurant with no recycle time;  to densely incapsulate the tractor that will counter threat weapon systems operating in the visual and near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at a rate of 30,000 cubic feet per minute; to be self cleaning/nonclogging; to be non toxic, non hazardous, (personnel will be exposed for long periods of time); to work with various fog fluids of differing densities; be weatherproof; must have ajustable fog rates (scenario dependant) able to produce fog greater than 100% of normal operations; to possess automated safety features that will shut the system down if overheating occurs (eliminate fire hazard) and to shut down when fuel reserves are exhausted; and must be rugged enough to withstand varying road operations. Delivery must be made to US Department of Energy, Pennsylvania & K Streets, Bldg 20397, Kirtland AirForce Base East, Albuquerque, NM 87117 No-later-than September 12th, 2005.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NNSA SC will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is NOT  a request for competitive proposals. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service as described above. Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, as to why they should be considered. All interested firms must respond by September 5th, 2005, 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time to Maria D.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER THREE (3) ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  

The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  

The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. The minimum guarantee is $25,000 for each contract.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  

The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. 

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.

In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT AS THE FIRST TASK ORDER UNDER THE CONTRACT.
  

All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  

The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  NUWCDIV Newport intends to place a Fixed Price sole source contract with TEAC America for the following items:  1 ea. GX-1 Main Unit; 1 ea. GX-AIT Data Storage Tape Drive; 1 ea. AU-GXEPIO Expansion Unit; and 26 ea. AR-GXPA Amplifier Modules.  This equipment is used for recording data from shock and vibration tests.  The basis for the sole source is that this procurement is a direct replacement for the instrumentation used on previous shock and vibration tests and also an upgrade to the current system to acquire more data channels.  NUWC has developed software to acquire and post process data from there machines, which would be costly and time consuming to redo for another system.  The TEAC GX-1 recorder is the only system that would enable direct comparison of the data acquired on the previous tests using the same model of recorder.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Salivary nitrosoproline in China, with the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6805.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of death in many countries around the world.  The NCI Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) conducts intramural research in the areas of nutrition and cancer, genetics and cancer, and cancer prevention.  The NEB NCI is currently examining the hypothesis that salivary nitrosamine formation is associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer and that poor oral health increases the formation of nitrosamines in the saliva.  Individual propensity to form nitrosamines will be assessed using a nitrosoproline phenotyping test. The purpose of this procurement is to obtain data on salivary nitrosoproline formation.  This data will aid the NEB in the examination of a cross-sectional study of esophageal cancer in Linxian, China.  The University of Nebraska shall determine Nitrosproline and N-nitrososarcosine concentration in 185 saliva samples from Linxian, China.  The type of assay NCI requires is used in experimental studies only and is not used in any clinical setting.  Therefore, only academic research labs can provide this specific work.  The University of Nebraska Medical Center is the only source known in the United States that is currently running this assay, has the expertise, and has studied in vivo nitrosamine formation.   

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 9, 2005.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Institutes for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), plans to procure on a sole source basis an Advanced Microscopy Techniques (AMT) HRL Side Mount 1.3 megapix accessory camera upgrade for the government owned AMT XR-100 CCD Camera system with Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp. (AMT), 3 Electronics Avenue, Danvers, MA  01923. 

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5.   This acquisition will be set-aside for one-hundred percent total small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

NINDS is pursuing an active program in electron microscopy of synaptic connections in the brain intent on understanding the molecular basis of the memory trace.  In particular electron microscopy (EM) tomography is being performed on our JEOL 200CX which is equipped with an AMT digital camera system destined to produce the high magnification, high resolution images of synapses needed to perform tomography.  These images cover only a limiting field of the specimen, and take several seconds each to collect.  This leaves the researchers switching back and forth to the phosphor viewing screen, which is viewed directly by eye, to search through our specimen or to align illumination and tilt axes.  This must be done continuously when collecting tomographic data.  The AMT HRL side mount is an accessory camera head that captures wide fields of view in real time.  Since it is run by the same computer that operates the high resolution camera, the operator can switch images back and forth on the same monitor screen with the flick of a button.  Furthermore the high resolution and low resolution images are rigorously axial so synapses can be discovered and tracked at low resolution and then immediately captured on the high resolution camera.  This will greatly increase the speed and effectiveness of the work in tomography.

Advanced Microscopy Techniques (AMT) is the only source known to NINDS that can provide the accessory camera head as this is an upgrade to an existing piece of equipment.  AMT is the sole manufacturer of this accessory.   The current digital camera purchased from AMT delivers superb high resolution images of the post synaptic density eminently suitable for tomographic analysis at a molecular level.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST, on September 9, 2005.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, via fax at 301-402-4513 or via electronic mail holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations reference NCI-50160-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding:  Defining molecular subtypes of lymphoma for relevance to survival, etiology, and diagnosis with University of Nebraska Medical Center, Eppley Institute for Cancer Research, Omaha, NE 68198-5440.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most heterogeneous and most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  Recent cDNA microarray gene expression studies have revealed two distinct DLBCL subtypes (germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL) and post-GCB-DLBCL) with clinical relevance, distinct normal cell counterparts, and occurrence of distinct oncogenic events. The goal of the present work is therefore to: 1) classify the DLBCL cases in the NCI-SEER NHL Case–Control Study by t(14;18) translocation status using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); 2) assess the prognostic significance of the t(14;18) translocation in our large, population-based sample and; 3) evaluate potential etiologic differences by t(14;18) translocation status.

The University of Nebraska has: 1) developed and optimized the required protocol in paraffin-embedded tissues, 2) has the required equipment to carry out the protocol, and, 3) recently published results from a study of t(14;18) translocation in paraffin-embedded tissues from the late 1980’s with a failure rate of < 1%.  No other laboratory has published equivalent data using this protocol.  NCI requires that the conduct of interphase FISH to identify the t(14;18) translocation status of DLBCL cases in the NCI-SEER Case–Control Study population be conducted at the University of Nebraska. The University of Nebraska is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned services and facilities.  

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 9, 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI-5109 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-05).  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure an order for reagents from BD Biosciences to continue testing of reagents for vaccine clinical trails (NIAID Project #: Z01-AI-005009).  The anticipated period of performance is from 09/14/05 thru 09/31/06. The Contractor will utilize shipments of custom IFN-g PE Clone (90 each), IL-2 PE Clone (90 each), CD4 Percp (157 each), CD3 APC (19 each), and CD8 (SK1) FITC (78 each) clinical reagents for the research vaccine development. Extensive testing and optimization was conducted at the onset of the clinical trail monitoring, these reagents from BD Biosciences was tested along with other reagents from other vendors. The primary goal is to maintain the consistency of the data; therefore the reagents must stay the same. It is necessary for each reagent to be of the same lot number in order to last through the entire phase of the study. BD Biosciences has been identified as the only responsible source for this procurement. Switching to another manufacturer would result in significant time delays, additional cost to the government to complete redo the optimization process of the clinical trails. This is not a Small-Business Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) Code for this acquisition is 325413, SIC Code 2835, and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  This is a firm fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are “Origin” and Net 30.  These items are to be shipped in specified quantities at the end-user’s request. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Contractor Terms and Conditions, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders, Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds.  In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an offeror ineligible for award.]  Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday, September 13, 2005.   For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room 2NE38E, MSC/2811 Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812.

<DESC>The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (“RRB”) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families.  The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974.  Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System.  The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry.  The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees.  The RRB’s headquarters, in which about 700 people are employed, is located in Chicago.  The RRB is seeking contractual support to convert its inventory of IDMS systems into a DB2/CICS environment.  The contractual support services shall include, but not be limited to, the conversion process, testing, knowledge transfer and migration.  RRB will issue an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) intend to procure on a sole-source basis with the Cancer Center and M Sklodowska-Cuie Institute of Oncology, WK Roentgena 5, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland to collect follow-up information from hospital records and Cancer Registries from breast cancer cases who participated in a case-control study in Warsaw and Lodz, Poland, conducted in 2000-2003. Specifically, information on breast cancer treatment, recurrence and survival 5 years after diagnosis will be collected from hospital medical records and Cancer Registries in Warsaw and Lodz.  The main objective of the breast cancer case-control study in Poland is to examine the relationship between breast cancer and reproductive and hormonal factors, physical activity, active and passive smoking, alcohol and occupational exposures, as well as genetic susceptibility factors and etiologic heterogeneity.  The follow-up study will allow the evaluation of predictors of recurrence and survival, including pre-diagnostic demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, genetic factors, tumor characteristics, and other risk factors.  The breast cancer patients for the proposed follow-up study were diagnosed and recruited at the participating hospitals: Cancer Center and M. Sklodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology in Warsaw at the Community Copernicus Hospital and Polish Mother’s Health Memorial Hospital in Lódz. The patients gave consent to study staff for access to medical records for research purposes. Therefore, only medical staffs from these hospitals have access to the medical records of these women. This is a follow-up to a previous case-control study that was conducted in Poland. There is no other contractor that has the access to this population and the expertise to carry out this follow-up study.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 8, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DECG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with The University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, 6229 Roy Carver Pavilion, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 for: Defining molecular subtypes of lymphoma for relevance to survival, etiology, and diagnosis.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background:  The Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch is working on a study to define molecular subtypes of lymphoma for relevance to survival, etiology, and diagnosis. The pathology specimens from the NCI-SEER Case–Control Study were collected and are being stored under a previous contract establishing the University of Iowa as the Pathology Review Center for the parent case–control study. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most heterogeneous and most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  Recent cDNA microarray gene expression studies have revealed two distinct DLBCL subtypes (germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL) and post-GCB-DLBCL) with clinical relevance, distinct normal cell counterparts, and occurrence of distinct oncogenic events.  Cases expressing a set of genes characteristic of germinal center B-cells (GCB-DLBCL) appear to show markedly better clinical prognosis than those expressing a set of genes characteristic of post-germinal center, activated peripheral blood B-cells (post-GCB-DLBCL) (five-year overall survival rates: 60-75% and 15-40%, respectively). Furthermore, distinct oncogenic events in these subtypes have been demonstrated: translocation is observed in GCB-DLBCL, whereas constitutive activation of the nuclear factor-êB (NF-êB) pathway is observed in post-GCB-DLBCL.  Together these findings suggest that GCB- and post-GCB-DLBCL may arise through separate pathogenetic mechanisms, yet no research on potential etiologic differences of these DLBCL subtypes has been published to-date.    For the first time, identification of these DLBCL subtypes in a large-scale, epidemiologic setting is possible due to the recent demonstration of the feasibility of using immunohistochemical staining for three proteins (CD10, BCL-6, and MUM1) to classify GCB- and post-GCB-DLBCL. The goal of the present work is to classify the DLBCL cases in the NCI-SEER NHL Case–Control Study by molecular subtype (GCB- and post-GCB-DLBCL) using immunohistochemical staining; to confirm the prognostic significance of the DLBCL molecular subtypes in our large, population-based sample; and to evaluate potential etiologic differences by DLBCL molecular subtype. The pathology specimens from the study are under the authority of Dr. Mohammad Vasef.  They have a collaborative arrangement to obtain the GCET antibody stain, which is not commercially available, and the laboratory has optimized the immunohistochemical staining protocol for the proteins of interest in paraffin-embedded tissues that may have undergone antigen degradation. The immunohistochemical staining to identify the molecular subtypes of DLBCL in the NCI-SEER Case–Control Study population is required to be conducted at the University of Iowa. The University of Iowa is the only known source to the NCI that can successfully complete this project.  Period of Performance:   one year from date of award.  This is a notice of intent not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT on September 13,  2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Tanker Systems Modernization Systems Squadron, ASC Mobility Systems Wing/TSMSS, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is currently seeking information and continuing market research activities to gain insight into the market to determine if there are potential sources that would be interested in providing a replacement aircraft for the KC-135.  Interested parties should have proven aircraft manufacturing or large scale modification experience and are required to provide a capabilities statement.  The criteria established for determination of meeting the capabilities is described below.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement.  This is a sources sought market survey announcement and the Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request.  Although "proposal" and "offeror"  are used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.   The purpose of this inquiry is to identify and obtain information from all responsible sources and interested parties who have a capability to meet United States air refueling requirements as identified below.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.

Replacement Tanker Aircraft (RTA) may be employed to support global attack, air-bridge, deployment, redeployment, homeland defense, theater support to joint, allied, coalition air and maritime forces; and specialized national defense missions.  Some of these aircraft will be used to support special operations and U.S. nuclear forces.   RTA may allow for mixing of secondary missions in a manner not to significantly impact its primary AR mission.  Secondary missions for RTA may include cargo and/or passenger transportation, aero medical evacuation, and Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) augmentation. CAPABILITY CRITERIA As a minimum offerors should provide their capability and experience in the following areas: -	Delivery of new aircraft in the size weight and performance class of KC135 or larger aircraft -	Aircraft design and modification to incorporate CNS/ATM compliant  systems; military defensive systems; military communications equipment with strategic and tactical interconnectivity; and night vision internal, external and cockpit illumination.  -	Airborne refueling concept of operations, technology, design,  development and test -	Fielding of fully integrated commercial and/or organic support systems  for military aircraft. Previous experience in implementing Public-Private Partnerships and performance based logistics concepts shall also be demonstrated, if any.  -	Receiving, handling, controlling, maintaining, and destruction of DOD  classified material to the secret level - 	The potential offeror shall demonstrate their ability to integrate  military capabilities on commercial derivative platforms.  Also, previous experience in obtaining FAA or equivalent type certificates or supplemental type certificates shall be demonstrated. Submit evidence of any FAA or  equivalent production, repair or alteration station licenses.    -	Offerors meeting the above criteria may be requested to supply  additional information on their specific capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

World Wide Web Addre ss:  https://abop.monmouth.army.mil 2	GENERAL INFORMATION 2.1	Background The US Army RDECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is soliciting proposals for the Advanced Soldier Mobility Sensor  Army Technology Objective [Demonstration] (ASMS  ATO [D]) through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. AS MS  ATO [D] is a 4-year ATO [D] to develop a low power prototype sensor with Advanced uncooled Longe Wave Infrared (LWIR) and Image Intensified (I2) Visible/Near Infrared/Short Wave Infrared (VIS/NIR/SWIR) helmet mounted vision sensor for mobility, target  detection, and situational awareness in complex terrain.  It will include a port to import alternate imagery/data (e.g. from a weapon sight) to the high resolution Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) and to export soldier borne sensor imagery. The Advanced Soldier Mobility Sensor (ASMS) ATO-D will develop low power prototype helmet mounted sensor that digitally fuse LWIR and VIS/NIR/SWIR sensor imagery into one image for soldier viewing on a high resolution Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for test and user evaluation.  The ASMS will improve the design of head borne sensors by specifically addressing the low power, electro-optical, and human factor designs that will enable soldiers to better navigate and more rapidly engage targets in total darkness and in the presence of battlefield obscurants by displaying a fused image across the entire field of view.  The ASMS will be compatible with currently issued laser aiming devices, such as the PEQ-2 and PAQ-4.  The digital image fusion processing architectu re will demonstrate the lowest possible power consumption through the use of a custom ASIC and will reside on the helmet.  The ASMS will also integrate a port to import alternate imagery/data (e.g. from a weapon sight) to the high resolution Helmet Mounted  Display (HMD) and to export soldier borne sensor imagery; the data link would allow soldier viewing of weapon sight imagery or FBCB2 type data and to export imagery. The objectives of the ASMS  ATO [D] are:  "	Perform human factors study to determine the optimum location for the LWIR and VIS/NIR/SWIR sensors and the HMD, as well as the optimum sensor field of view for mobility in complex and urban terrains. "	Conduct trade studies to determine the best LWIR and VIS/NIR/SWIR sensor candidates for image fusion and what electronic functions the digital image fusion Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) should encompass. "	Develop custom ASIC to demonstrate the lowest sensor power possible. "	Deliver 4 prototype ASM Sensors for user evaluation. 2.2	Contracting Strategy The Government anticipates using a Cost Plus contract type.  Offerors may propose alternate contract types, provided that the alternative is delineated in the proposal and is determined to be acceptable by the Government.  NVESD intends to award multiple  contracts and/or agreements in FY06 for an initial phase of trade studies (Phase I) with an Option to proceed to Phases II and III (which may or may not be exercised). Each Phase I effort is anticipated to be funded at approximately $200K for a 12 month p eriod of performance. The results from this phase will be evaluated based upon performance and an apparent likelihood of success in a field demonstration.  At that time, the determination will be made whether or not to exercise the Phase II Option. In Phas e II, the contractor(s) would produce a Critical Design Review (CDR) for the ASM Sensor, including but not limited to a custom digital fusion ASIC design, sensor selection, configuration, and power budget. After successful completion of the CDR, funding wi ll be released for ASIC fabrication to begin.  The Phase II efforts are anticipated to be funded at approximately $5M total for a 12 month period of performance, including the funding to begin the custom ASIC fabrication.  In Phase III, the contractor woul d produce a custom ASIC that will incorporate as many e lectronic functions as is practical for lowest total sensor power consumption, as well as a set of 4 prototype ASM Sensors. The custom ASIC will be delivered to the PM Soldier Sensors and Lasers Digital Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (DENVG) program of recor d at the end of FY08.  The Phase III effort is anticipated to be funded at approximately $3M for a 24 month period of performance.  Phase III includes an Executive Review by the Warrior Technology Council at the end of FY08 to decide whether to continue with the ASMS ATO [D], based on ASIC development progress.  If the ASIC is completed or shows clear signs of being able to be completed in time to transition to the PM Soldier Sensors and Lasers DENVG Program of Record according to their schedule, the prog ram will continue; otherwise it will terminate at the end of FY08.   2.3	Description of Effort 2.3.1	Program Description    NVESD anticipates that ASMS  ATO [D] will be a 48-month, three phase program to develop a custom digital fusion ASIC and 4 prototype ASM Sensors. Phase I will be a study of existing and near term sensor technologies and digital fusion algorithms. The Phas e II option will be a detailed design study that will fully define the ASM Sensor and will culminate in a CDR.  The Phase III option will be the fabrication of the custom ASIC, with delivery to the DENVG program at the end of FY08, and ASM Sensors integrat ion.  At the end of FY08 an Executive Review will take place and will determine whether to continue the ATO [D] to completion at the end of FY09.   2.3.2	Task Outline  Phase I "   Conduct trade studies including, but not limited to: determine which sensors are best suited to being fused to support soldier mobility, determine the optimum location for said sensors, determine the optimum field of view for said sensors, and determin e which fusion algorithm is to be used. 2.3.3	Task Outline  Phase II Option "	Conduct detailed design of the ASM Sensor leading up to Critical Design Review. "	Begin custom ASIC design and fabrication upon successful completion of CDR. 2.3.4	Task Outline  Phase III Option "	Complete ASIC fabrication for delivery to DENVG program by end of FY08. "	Begin system integration. "	Undergo Executive Review to determine ASMS completion potential. "	Deliver 4 ASM Sensors by end of FY09. 3	PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS 3.1	General Instructions Offerors will have until 2:00 p.m. (EST), 30 SEP 05 to submit their proposals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement, DG133C-05-RQ-1822, constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, requires the services of a contractor to conduct analysis of 77 benthic samples taken from the California continental shelf for taxonomic identification. The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price order on a best value basis. Evaluation factors are: 
1) Qualifications of personnel 
    - education and demonstrated experience with identification of benthic infauana    
     specific to the central California continental shelf and slope 
 2) QA/QC Plan  - offerors shall submit a brief quality assurance plan that describes how the project will be managed, all QA/QC procedures and how these procedures will be managed. There shall be one data quality objective (DQOs) for this project: the number of individuals of each invertebrate taxa of interest per sample (units: individuals/sample; expected range:  0 to 3000; accuracy: 95%).

<DESC>Modification 0001 is hereby issued to delete in its entirety previously submitted Sources Sought N00178-05-Q-1925 that was posted 18 August 2005 to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and to replace with the revised copy below. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While is it understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. Description - The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), on behalf of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) desires information that may lead to the acquisition and qualification of a family of 120mm mortar ammunition for enhancing the AC-130 Gunship Lethality and Survivability.   NSWCDD and AFSOC are seeking information on any (guided or conventional) 120mm mortar round that is currently fielded, currently a Program of Record (POR), or technology mature enough to enter into an ACTD or similar demonstration.   The 120mm mortar concept shall offer benefits to the AC-130 fleet through:  Employment flexibility through use of munitions currently available; Greater lethality through more fragmentation weight and greater blast damage; Precision strike capability; Increased standoff range and attack altitude while maintaining responsiveness; Reduction in collateral damage; Reduction in danger close distance when supporting troops in contact. Responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, reference customers (to confirm COTS/NDI status of the product, if applicable), product production history (volume, if applicable), summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 16 September 2005 to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: Code XDS105, Building 183, First Floor, Room 133, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH THE SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED ONE OR MORE SEED PROJECTS AS TASK ORDER(S) UNDER THE CONTRACT.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offeror’s must also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.

Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.

The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation pr

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to support strategy development to increase effectiveness of the PROACT Environmental Information Clearinghouse service.  PROACT supports dissemination of information and knowledge that contributes to AFCEE's efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain leding-edge techniques. A specific objective of this RFI is to support creation of a virtual library on technical environmental resources that will be integrated into the fabric of HQ AFCEE. The environmental information exchange service should function as maps and Yellow Pages that point to knowledge but do not contain knowledge.  The virtual library concept is viewed as part of a core knowledge infrastructure supporting all programs, domains, and disciplines consistent with AFCEE’s roles and responsibilities including PROACT and the existing Air Force environmental training program, AFCEE/TDE Web University, hosted on the HQ AFCEE web site.  Additional objectives of this information support program are:  to communicate environmentally relevant Air Force guidance and policy; to facilitate development of technical guidance by discovery and delivery of relevant technical information that supports subject matter experts; to assist teams of professionals in conducting root-cause analysis; developing collaborative solutions to technical requirements, and quality evaluations.  Information received will be used for strategic planning functions that include: defining core infrastructure requirements; change and enhancement of the PROACT Information Clearinghouse program; change and enhancement of Web University; identification and deployment of measurement systems, program analysis, planning, and development; benchmarking and process migration.  The enhanced system must be responsive, accurate, flexible, and offer value-added products.

Requested information should consider both human and technical attributes for integration of data, documents, web sites, publications and subject matter experts.  The approach will address information/knowledge requirements identified in the PROACT Information needs assessment; the AFCEE IT Strategy Report as well as advances in knowledge management and lessons learned within the Portal, GCSS-AF, AF Knowledge Now, and the DoD’s Network Centric Enterprise Service (NCES) Architecture.   The resulting AFCEE strategy must support conduct of the organization’s mission.  The overarching objective of this RFI is to develop approaches to revise and update information and data systems to better identify the most appropriate contextual knowledge, not necessarily the most readily available, consistent with advances in the practice of knowledge management techniques.

Provide recommendations and conceptual approaches including but not limited to, techniques, software and hardware, as well as processes and procedures for developing an automated system for information management and process integration.  Consider:  management of data, information and knowledge contained in internal and external documents and databases; personnel resources of the Air Force and AFCEE, approaches to “mine” organizational data and information and/or knowledge sources in order to improve business practices.

PROACT

The Air Force (AF) PROACT Environmental Information Exchange service has been in operation since October 1992 and has answered over 25,000 technical inquiries from AF military and civilian personnel, with customers at every organizational level from installation personnel to the Secretary of Air Force (SAF).  The PROACT environmental information exchange helps Air Force personnel and current Air Force contractors meet pollution prevention goals and maintain environmental compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The PROACT information researcher currently provides answers to technical inquiries using databases; publications; library services; expert consultants from industry, AF, DoD, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), as well as state and local regulatory agencies as appropriate.  Tracking and documentation of customer data includes personal data and information from past inquiries, customer contacts, date of response to the customer, and time spent preparing response.  

Problem Definition: How do we create new capabilities consistent with Air Force Portal requirements to assist the end-to-end AFCEE business intelligence and analysis processes in addressing the Knowledge Discovery challenges while laying a foundation for the technologies of tomorrow?  This problem includes the following elements:

1. Massive, heterogeneous, unstructured, scattered, and unreliable data
2. Identification of complex, time-critical concepts
3. Capabilities for evolving user defined agents to assist in hypothesis investigation and “what-if” scenarios
The massive amounts of input data must be selected and presented in a way that drives the discovery and maximum use of the knowledge desired.  To do this, the volume of data must be reduced and filtered so that users are only provided with relevant data.  The approach must be sufficiently flexible to take advantage of current technology and allow phased upgrade of the initial capability to achieve interoperability with future advances.  Recommendations should include the evaluation of indigenous Air Force Portal Capabilities, off-the-shelf software, hardware and information/knowledge management techniques in order to optimize information and knowledge exchange.

Information products must communicate known guidance and policy, support Air Force Program Managers, comply with Department of Defense policy and guidance, and promote use of DoD sources and tools databases.   Information products and sources should be searchable using key words and concepts while remaining appropriately accessible for management evaluation.   The process must include metrics to identify and track customer-based priority targets that require special emphasis.  Information products should address key issues of importance such as recent rule-making activities, and regulatory updates or summarize technical responses to inquiries of general interest which are designed to reach the broadest range of Air Force callers and installations.  The information system should support development of solutions to previously unanswered problems including discovery of relevant, state-of-science information as well as identify subject matter experts.  The information developed and maintained in the system should be proactively diffused using multi-media cross feed products that are responsive to needs of the Air Force environmental community and promote corroboration in application of knowledge.  All products must be consistent with AFCEE policies and quality standards.
GOALS 
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, this RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for: 
 
1. Using state-of-the-art technology to develop enhanced information discovery along with environmental library resource management techniques that support the Environmental Information Clearing house program.
2. Suggested methods to collect, index (with a systematic numbering system) and file information from vendors and/or AF personnel concerning environmental technologies or products which could be implemented at military installations.  The expected result is the development of a content aggregation, organization, and discovery capability consistent with the policy, goals, and directives of the U. S. Air Force CIO concerning the Air Force Portal and methods for content management.
3. Methods for tracking usage of the information service, monitoring and assessing customer awareness of program services, effectiveness, customer satisfaction and identifying information needs.  Please include recommend approaches (such as advertising) or initiatives to maintain awareness and relevance of the service to Air Force stakeholders.
4. Approaches for database management, security access control, indexing, search, and geospatial software/standards, security certification and accreditation, along with any integration services necessary to complete system development.
5. Approaches to employ outside technical publications, services, subscriptions, licenses and other methods for streamlining access to technical and professional publications, guidance documents, as well as the policy, regulations and instructions which are essential for accomplishing the AFCEE mission.  Please incorporate recommendations with regard to design, modeling, selection, and implementation of technical information management systems necessary to advance the basic capabilities from both a hardware and software perspective.
6. Approaches to coordinate and leverage reporting of current events, communication, outreach and training related to topic areas such as:  Web University, Technology, Performance Based Management (PBM), Remedial System Optimization (RPO), Waste Management, Pollution Prevention, Sustainability, Natural Resources, and Cultural Resources.

WEB UNIVERSITY

The WebU system automates training delivery, stores, manages, and delivers information and tools, provides access to environmental information and resources, and serves as a portal to other environmental education and training resources and providers. WebU resides on two servers and operates in a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database environment, which allows users to interact with the Environmental Education and Training (EET) database through an interface consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and Active Server Pages.  WebU scripts allow users to enter, edit, and track environmental education and training data equal to the user’s level of permission and generate a variety of real-time reports.

The EET database consist of 20+ tables containing Air Force occupational series and job codes, performance-based tasks, regulatory mandates, unit equipment codes, training source information, course content, student and faculty information, and other data required to generate the Web University website.  The EET database functions as a Learning and Content Management System (LCMS or LMS) to deliver:  automated registration and authentication of student and faculty members; user ID and password management; management and delivery of course content; student activity tracking; test generation and scoring, and certificate management.  Reports generated by the database include web trends, user and course reports, the Area of Responsibility Checklist for overseas theaters, Air Force Environmental Task List, and the DoD Sources and Tools Catalog.  Authorized users are also able to upload documents such as meeting Minutes and briefings for long-term storage.

PROACT currently supports Web University through cross feed of requested Web University educational materials and collection of feedback forms and information.

Problem Definition: How do we integrate current and new capabilities to most effectively leverage resource to optimize information and training support; increase customer access, and streamline access, registration and other interactions?

GOALS
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, This RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for:
1. Using state of the art technology that will support distance learning.  
2. Managing student enrollment, delivery of training content, assessment of training effectiveness, curriculum development, course content management, and collaboration with external activities that provide relevant training.
3. Provide recommendations that will more fully integrate environmental information clearinghouse and environmental education and training activities.
4. Consolidating and integrating data contained in PRO-ACT and Air Force Environmental Education and Training databases to minimize duplication of effort, share resources, and provide on-line access to information and resources through the appropriate forum (i.e. PRO-ACT, WebU Library, etc.).  Consideration should be given to identifying and including information in the DoD Sources and Tools Database, referencing in WebU courses, and featuring in the WebU Spotlight to alert users to noteworthy events, news, and information.
5. Approaches for supporting WebU students and users.  Areas of consideration should include, but not be limited to, WebU Help Desk; recommended initial point of contact for content related questions; maintaining course links and references; monitoring and updating regulatory references contained in the Environmental Master Task List and Area of Responsibility Checklists, and identifying obsolete and additional tasks.
6. Approaches for developing and maintaining Environmental Facts Sheets or information summaries.  For example, a subject-specific Facts Sheet prepared as single or double sided information sheets with charts, graphs, and brief statements related to a specific topic or program.  Provide recommendation for approaches to select topics warranting information summary development; determining the appropriate number of summaries, and process to efficiently maintain current accurate content for all AFCEE program areas.

"	Implementation of the FREEBALANCE fund control system MARAD-wide (headquarters, regions and field offices) and understand the interface capability among FREEBALANCE obligation & payment, payroll labor distribution system, credit card system and MARAD's main accounting system DAFIS and DELPHI, and Electronic Invoicing system. "	Understanding the two accounting system and conversion from DAFIS to DELPHI, (i.e., a COTS - Oracle Federal Financial System), such as all of the conversion of MARAD's interfaces among FREEBALANCE, EIS, Labor Distribution System and DELPHI. "	Assist MARAD in advising & resolving the accounting valuation of MARAD's national defense vessels.  Provided a mechanism for MARAD to track construction in progress for resolving the OIG's issue.   "	Develop a Federal Project Modual for the future to handle federal reimbursable accounting and credit reform accounting. "	Maintaining MARAD's  Payroll System from the Department of Transportation's to the Department of Interior's Payroll System,  ensuring that MARAD's new payroll system and related payroll coding structure meet with MARAD's infrastructure of General Ledger and Project Accounting.   "	Assist MARAD in developing mechanism and implementing DOT-wide labor distribution system and interface to DELPHI in FY 2006. "	Assist MARAD to develop the mechanism in implementing DOT-wide Managerial Cost Accounting  in FY 2006, and "	Assist MARAD in planning and assessing MARAD's requirements to meet the OMB Circular A-123 Internal Control  in FY 2006.    "	Provide professional accounting staff members to assist the office when carrying out accounting functions during the transition period of outsourcing accounting data entry functions to DOT Enterprise Service Center in Oklahoma (e.g., accounting operations function on purchase cards, Intra-governmental Payment and Collection - IPAC , fixed assets, etc.).  MARAD's and DOT's Needs for Continuing Enhancement on Financial  Management MARAD's Office of Accounting continues confronting a tremendous pressure & challenges from the OMB, Treasury and DOT, Office of Secretary, and requires assistance in the following areas: 1.	The requirements for agencies to achieve a "GREEN" status under the President's Management Agenda on financial management have imposed agencies to take aggressive actions to develop a managerial cost accounting system for measuring and evaluating financial and program performance. 2.	Furthermore, this year, the OMB requires agencies government-wide to submit FY 2005 audited financial statement to the OMB no later than November 15, 2004.  Therefore, DOT/MARAD has only 46 days (from October 1 to November 15) to: prepare to work with the OIG for resolving audit issues; and, to work with the OST to submit an audited consolidated DOT FY 2004 financial statement to the OMB.  In conjunction with MARAD, develop strategies, mechanism and various supporting reconciliation and reports to facilitate and defend the preparation of MARAD's FY 2005 audited financial statement according to the OST and the OIG's tight time frame.  3.	DOT, under government-wide initiative, is in the process of converting current DOT payroll system to the Department of Interiors' (DOI) payroll system.  MARAD completed the Phase I of the conversion and will implement the Phase II of the conversion in FY 2006 (i.e., conversion of the labor distribution system).  The implementation of this Phase II is very critical to DOT's meeting "Green" status of the President's Management Agenda.  The OST has imposed a tighter timeframe for OAs to complete this phase II in FY 2006.     4.	The OST, B-30 (Office of Financial Management) and OAs are currently in the process of testing the development of an on-demand Financial Statement Solution (FSS) for preparing and supporting monthly financial statement.   The timely testing and implementation of FSS is very critical to convince and meet the OIG's audit requirements. 5.	One of the OIG's finding on DOT's weakness in the reconciliation and confirmation for eliminating the duplicated counting of "Intra-Departmental" and "Intra-Governmental" financial activities (e.g., revenue, expense, accounts payable and accounts receivable within Federal government should be eliminated).  This is one  the weakness that prevents DOT from achieving "Green" status of the President's Management Agenda.  MARAD has approximately 1,000 open intra-governmental agreements (including proving and receiving services).      6.	The OMB Circular A-123 requires agencies to conduct internal control review on each and every line item presented on the financial statement.  The first internal control assessment report under the OMB Circular A123 is due after the end of FY 2006.  However, the review should start during FY 2006.  This means that MARAD must have a plan and mechanism in place, and work with OST and OIG to develop strategies to meet this requirement.     7.	Under the OST's initiative and plan, MARAD is required to sunset the current internal fund control system (FREEBALNCE) by the end of FY 2006 and implement the DELPHI's Budget Execution Modual.  The sunset of FREEBALANCE will interrupt and impact the interface between EIS and DELPHI.  The implementation of Budget Execution Modual fund control system will require efforts and knowledge for the conversion. 8.	Under the DOT's initiatives, all OAs are required to implement IMAGING system for invoices.  This implementation will require restructuring of work flow and work force and will require research and study of the interface between IMAGE and DELPHI. 9.	Continue to enhance the interface of small purchase card system and DELPHI. 10.	Under the DOT's initiative, continue to provide resources and expertise during the interim period for transferring accounting data entry function to DOT's Enterprise Services Center in Oklahoma City.   11.	Continue to provide training for new process, new mechanism and weak operations.  Provide the following: 1.	A rough order of magnitude of cost estimate and a capabilities statement.  (this is not a request for proposals/quotes, not a solicitation reading to a contract). 2.	If on the GSA Schedule, provide contract number. 3.	Provide Social-Economic status. MARAD will not be responsible for any costs associated with information provided in response to this RFI. Period of Performance:  Five Years (one base year and 4 option years)

<DESC>The Division of Blood Diseases and Resources of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to perform as the Clinical Data Coordinating Center for the project entitled: Phase II/III Clinical Trial of Sildenafil for Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees.  The purpose of the study is to test the effects of 16 weeks of chronic sildenafil therapy on exercise endurance and pulmonary artery pressure in 180 patients (aged 14 and up) with PH and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).  It is anticipated that up to twelve clinical sites will be awarded under a separate RFP.  The Clinical Data Coordinating Center will have overall responsibility for the operation of the clinical trial and will be responsible for performing the following tasks: 1) Collect data from up to 12 clinical sites capable of recruiting study subjects;  2) Prepare statistical reports as needed to monitor study progress, quality of data, and clinical center performance;  3) Participate in the finalization of the study protocol and Manual of Procedures and train study personnel on study procedures;  4) Develop and distribute Case Report Forms to all clinical sites;  5) Oversee a Pharmacy Distribution Center and develop a system for random assignment to each treatment arm for each patient enrolled in the trial;  6) Implement a process for communicating random assignments to the individual clinical sites;  7) Perform data analyses of all study data;  8) Provide coordination and leadership in the resolution of operational problems for the entire study; 9) Develop plans for either secure web-based electronic data entry, or paper data entry, by clinical sites; and 10) Comply with the DHHS Automated Information Systems Security Program (AISSP) Handbook found at this location: http://irm.cit.nih.gov/policy/aissp.html.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-10 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and three copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience pertinent to the management and operation of a multi-center clinical trial for sickle cell disease, including expertise in drug distribution, tracking of adverse events, data collection and monitoring, standardization, quality control, data analysis, and preparation of scientific reports;  2) Adequacy of the organizational and administrative structure to participate in a multi-center randomized clinical trial, both in the collection of data from multiple clinical sites as well as experience in monitoring the quality and timeliness of data;  3) Facilities, equipment and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above;  4) The firm’s status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for a period of four years with an approximate award date of September 30, 2006.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide information pertinent to the requirements mentioned above within (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

<DESC>ATTENTION: PLEASE ADDRESS ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO MR. LAWRENCE MITCHELL OR 1LT MAURICE EDMONDSON: lawrence.mitchell@pentagon.af.mil OR maurice.edmondson@brooks.af.mil 
Current Concepts of Operation (CONOPS), technologies, and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) all lack required integration of information to give Combatant Commander near real time status of a biological event.  This system of systems will address the shortfall with a comprehensive diagnostic and informatics surveillance system, utilizing “state of the art” technology, identifying both natural and hostile biological pathogens, near “real-time”.

This announcement covers a systems technology which is a transformation dual use approach for operational medicine and biodefense, designed to rapidly detect and identify a wide range of pathogens.  It is intended to overcome two diagnostic challenges to discriminate between diverse pathogens that present similar to flu-like symptoms; and screen rapidly, accurately and simultaneiously across multiple 20-100+ candidate pathogens.  This technology will use sophisticated,  molecular biology procedures, bio-informatics, and connectivity to provide commanders at all levels the information needed to make time-critical decisions.  Ultimately this situational awareness provides a high likelihood that correct diagnostic decision will be made, even prior to the onset of symptoms.   Interested contractors are requested to forward a talking paper, not more than two (2) pages in length together with candidate product information sheets for diagnostics and surveillance, not later than 7 September, 2005 to the following:

Advanced Diagnostics Lab, Attention Mr. Lawrence Mitchell, 5201 Leesburg Pike, Suite 1401, Falls Church, Virginia 22041. lawrence.mitchell@pentagon.af.mil.  All submissions should be sent electronically, even if additional copies or fact sheets are mailed separately.  The offeror's response needs to provide at a minimum, all areas in the criteria section below:

It is the Government's intent to ultimately contract with a viable company for the purpose of developing an advanced diagnostics system.  The solicitation is issued without restrictions and is intended only to invite participation.  It is not intended as an invitation for proposals.

The importance of rapid detection of biological pathogens for both common and bio-warfare agents is well documented, embedded in several Joint Requirement documents, including CJCS Force Health Protection, Joint War fighting S&T Plan, 2003, and most recently Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum for Joint Chiefs of Staff, dated 20 Jan, 2004, requirement the military health system to develop the next generation of “integrated early warning health protection systems”.  COCOMs need the ability to detect biological events/attacks in near real time to project (warn, treat, and respond) forward forces, garrisoned troops, and forces at embarkation, and debarkation.
This technology will leverage RDT&E for a Level 3 platform (clinics or Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS)) components to improve capabilities of a Level 5 (medical treatment facilities such as large hospitals with clinical and medial research laboratory facilities) and highly trained personnel.  This platform level represents initial baseline capabilities for the installation at the Advanced Diagnostics lab, Lackland AFB (prototype testing and demonstration).

The offeror/contractor will be asked to address in writing how the company's technology is capable of meeting the following provisions:
1.	Diagnostics are capable of detecting 20 pathogens or more within four (4) or less hours at a total cost not to exceed $75.
2.	Detection uses diagnostics technology that is FDA approved
3.	Demonstrate the capacity to perform biosurveillance using a multiplex detection process of clinical specimens for up to 100 pathogens in four (4) hours or less
4.	Diagnostics capability will test upper respiratory infections utilizing throat swabs, nasal washings, and blood specimens


After reviewing the offerors' technology solution, selected contractors will be asked to participate in a demonstration/presentation of their technology at the Westin Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, on September 26-28, 2005.  Final date of presentations will be determined after selection of candidates is approved.  Candidates will be notified of their participation electronically not later than 9 September, 2005.  Format for the presentations of candidate vendors will be provided in detail following selection.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources capable of manufacturing 20MM M246 HEIT-SD cartridges with MK7 Links, NSN 1305-01-528-7215, DODIC AA96; and 20MM M940 MPT-SD cartridges with MK7 Links, NSN and DODIC to be establ ished.  The yearly anticipated requirement is approximately 500,000 to 1,000,000 cartridges.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal p arts, (2) production of propellant, (3) cartridge case priming and loading w/propellant, and (4) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment are req uired to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Experience in ballistic testing, expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, and process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  A n approved ballistic test range, 20mm single shot test (MANN) barrel(s), and an M168 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool ro om equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of these cartridges is complex and requires sophist icated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition process/design engineers, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control  engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test personnel, etc) needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, potential producers must be a ble to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test within 120 days after award, with the first production delivery due within 180 days after award.  The technical data packages (TDP) associated with 20mm M246 and 20mm M940 cartridges are coded Distribution X, which means distribution is authorized to U.S. Government agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technical data in accordance with regulations implemented in 10 USC 140C.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Asymptomatic Reactivation Of Varicella Virus Following Stressful Life Events
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Fitzsimmons Building 500, Aurora, Colorado 80045-0500 to do the following:

BACKGROUND: Following primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus establishes a permanent, latent infection within ganglia. VZV can reactivate clinically years later to cause herpes zoster (HZ). Ten to 20% of persons develop HZ during life (~700,000 cases annually); risks are greatest among the elderly and the immunosuppressed. HZ can cause post-herpetic neuralgia, a chronic, often incapacitating condition with no fully effective treatment. The burden of HZ is high and is increasing as the “baby boom” cohort ages. The factors leading to development of HZ are not known: virtually all adults are infected with VZV, yet only a minority develop HZ. In order to develop prevention strategies, the correlates of protection against HZ is an area of active research. Clearly, immunity can protect against the development of HZ, but the mechanisms by which immunity is boosted in some persons and not others is not known. Some researchers believe that asymptomatic reactivation of VZV occurs, and that this reactivation then “internally boost” specific HZ immunity, thereby protecting against subsequent HZ. This phenomenon might similarly boost varicella vaccine mediated immunity and thereby reduce the risk of vaccine failure (Krause P, et al. Nature Med 2000; 6:451–454). Others reject this hypothesis, speculating instead that a key mode of protection against HZ and against vaccine failure is from “external boosting” of immunity by exposure to persons with varicella occurring in the general population (Hope-Simpson RE. Proc R Soc Med 1965;58:9–2). Of course, both mechanisms may also be at play. Currently, neither of these hypotheses has been convincingly validated, but the debate has taken on significance because of the growing burden of HZ. Also, if exposure to varicella in the population is the primary determinant to maintenance of specific immunity to HZ, reduction in circulation of VZV due to introduction of varicella vaccination could cause a decline in anti-HZ protection and increase the risk of HZ, and it might reduce protection against primary infection with varicella among vaccinees. On the other hand, if asymptomatic reactivation occurs, subsequent internal boosting could over-ride the impacts of varicella exposure on HZ risk and on duration of vaccine-mediated immunity. A recent study used 2 PCR techniques to test for presence of VZV in saliva specimens from 8 asymptomatic astronauts before, during and after space flight lasting 10-13 days. The astronauts’ saliva was sampled every 1-2 days during a 1 month period beginning 8 months prior to flight, throughout flight, and during the first 15 days after flight. Whereas VZV shedding was detected in just 1 of 112 saliva samples collected prior to flight, during and after flight, shedding was detected in 61 of 200 total specimens, including specimens from all 8 astronauts, and from almost all sampling times (Mehta SK, et al. J Med Virol 2004;72:174–17). Results of the 2 PCR techniques were discordant, and varied from by day during and after flight in unpredictable ways. The affect of this viral shedding on immunity was not reported, and it was not possible to identify immunologic or other predictors of shedding since shedding occurred for all 8 astronauts. Asymptomatic shedding of VZV in saliva is indicative of reactivation, providing a mechanism for internal boosting. The results of this study were therefore intriguing, but their implications unclear: was shedding by astronauts just a “space curiosity” or might it occur in response to more common provocations? If so, is asymptomatic reactivation a point on the clinical spectrum of HZ, or is it qualitatively different from HZ? Does reactivation boost specific immunity and thereby prevent subsequent HZ, and if so can researchers take advantage of the phenomenon to determine the immunologic correlates of protection against HZ? Finally, does reactivation of vaccine-strain VZV also occur, and might this also boost immunity, making vaccine-mediated immunity to VZV more durable? STATEMENT OF WORK: It is proposed to conduct a pilot study to test for VZV shedding among groups of persons undergoing various provocations: 1) to confirm a report that asymptomatic reactivation of VZV occurs (as indicated by shedding in saliva), and to extend those findings to persons undergoing common physiologic stressors so that its implications can be investigated in follow up studies; 2) to determine whether asymptomatic shedding of vaccine-strain VZV also occurs; 3) to determine whether there is an association between baseline levels of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to VZV and shedding. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, and material necessary for the purpose of conducting a study to test for VZV shedding among groups of persons undergoing various provocations; make various determinations as defined in the tasks and provide a written report of the findings. Co-PI’s will identify site coordinators who will be responsible for the following activities: 1. Enrollment of the following subjects, using proper informed consent as described in protocol: a. At least 8 adults 61 through 70 years of age unambiguously reporting a history of varicella who are scheduled to undergo any variant of elective open-heart cardiac surgery at least 2 weeks after enrollment b.

Saliva specimens will be labeled with the proper identification number, and stored at -200 C (e.g., at home freezer temperature) until shipment to CDC. Note, collection and storage of some or all of the saliva specimens using OroSure sponge kits can be conducted by subjects themselves so long as they are properly trained regarding collection and labeling of specimens, understand the techniques, have the facilities (e.g., a functioning home freezer) to properly store the specimens, and can be relied upon to conduct all these steps correctly. 5. Ship data collection instrument along with whole blood, serum, and saliva samples from all ?96 subjects to CDC in Atlanta at 40 C (i.e., on ice or using ice-packs) using proper shipping procedures for biological materials; for each subject, the data collection instrument and all whole blood, serum and saliva samples should be shipped within 1 week after collection of the final saliva sample (i.e., the sample collected 1 week after surgery or the race). Data collection instrument (about 2-3 pages in length) shall be furnished for each of the 96 subjects. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Shall last 6 months, commencing with the date of contract award. DELIVERABLES: Contractor shall provide completed data collection instruments, whole blood, serum and saliva samples for 96 subjects, all collected, labeled, stored and shipped appropriately and in a timely manner as described above. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: 1. The contractor should be a large medical center with surgical departments having sufficient patient volume to provide a high likelihood for enrollment of all required surgical subjects during a 4 month period, and the center should be able to provide data to demonstrate such patient volume for all categories of surgical patients in the study. Specifically, the medical center should provide recent retrospective hospital data relating to volume of elective open-heart cardiac surgery, elective orthopedic hip replacement surgery, and elective intra-abdominal laparoscopic surgery. Roughly, to meet these volume criteria, the medical center should conduct ?5 such procedures weekly for adults, and ?2 such procedures weekly for children, unless they can provide other assurance that they can recruit the necessary number of patients during a 4 month study period. 2. The contractor should be located in a community with active road runners clubs and with sufficient number of road races (i.e., jogging races, marathons) per calendar year, and with sufficient participation, to provide a high likelihood for enrollment of all required runners intending 10 mile road races during a 4 month period. The contractor should be able to provide documentation of an active road race calendar. 3. The contractor should be able to provide examples of relevant past clinical research involving recruitment of patients for clinical studies.

<SUBJECT>B -- Monitoring for Dengue Fever in the Southwestern United States
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures with the University of Colorado, CU Trauma Studies and Resource Center, Colorado Springs, CO, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The resulting purchase order will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, ad 13 through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-5.  A ten (10) month purchase order is planned.
The University of Colorado has an ongoing study since 2002, which has provided much pertinent data.  It employs an integrated approach to examining the impact of climate variability and human environmental interactions on the proliferation of Aedes aegypti, a topical/subtropical mosquito vector of dengue fever, in a desert climate.  Aedes aegypti has extended its range to include the cities of Nogales, AZ and Tucson, AZ.  Temperature and relative humidity are being collected on an hourly basis for all 68 geographically stratified sites.  It is planned that the University of Colorado will continue to monitor the climate loggers for longitudinal study data which allows climate researchers to enhance local level monsoon observations where dengue is epidemic annually in the post monsoon season and where dengue hemorrhagic fever has recently emerged.  Continuous monitoring of mosquito ecology, vegetation, and temperature and humidity will provide public health officials with a valuable data set of correlations across environmental parameters and the study will allow NOAA to improve support for the public health community for monitoring of Dengue Fever and West Nile Virus. For the above reasons it would be untimely and too costly for any other firm to provide the services of this requirement.  A justification for other than full and open competition is on file (ref: NRMT0000-5-00039).

<SUBJECT>A -- Prospective, placebo-controlled trial of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Agonist (PPAR) to prevent further beta cell loss in youths with newly-diagnosed, autoimmune-mediated type 1 diabetes
<DESC>Prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Agonist (PPAR) versus placebo to prevent further beta cell loss in young patients with recently-diagnosed, autoimmune-mediated type 1 diabetes
<p>
<b>SUMMARY: </b> The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide active agent (PPAR agonists such as thiazolidinediones) and placebo to study the safety and possible protective effect of the agent on pancreatic beta cell function in young individuals with new onset autoimmune mediated type 1 diabetes.
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION: </b> The NIDDK is developing a prospective, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist therapy for the treatment of members of the pediatric population between the ages of 8 and 18 who have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the previous 6 weeks.  The trial will be conducted at the Clinical Center on the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  It is anticipated that 30 subjects will be enrolled in each arm of the trial (30 on study agent, 30 on placebo).  Treatment is expected to last 12 months from the time of enrollment.  Repeated C-peptide stimulation tests will be conducted.  Serial immunological assays will be performed to monitor the anti-beta cell immune response.  Additional factors will be monitored including blood glucose control, blood pressure, lipid levels, and inflammatory markers.  Subjects will be guided in diabetes management in order to assure that optimal blood glucose control is achieved and maintained during the research study.
<p>
<b>STUDY GOAL:</b>  The overall goal of this study is to determine whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist therapy (such as thiazolidinediones) is a safe and effective therapy to prevent further loss of beta cell function in a pediatric patient population.
<p>
<b>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:</b>  Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by T cell mediated, autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells resulting in nearly absolute insulin deficiency. It affects more than 1 million people in the US and typically presents during childhood or young adulthood. During the first year after diagnosis, patients frequently experience several months during which they require very little insulin and glucose management is easy. However, further destruction of beta cells leads to worsening of the condition such that blood glucose control becomes increasingly difficult, and if patients fail to keep their blood sugar values near normal, they are at increased risk for micro- and macrovascular complications. Since the 1980s, several clinical trials have shown that immunosuppression can hold or slow down this destructive process, but the safety of such an approach remains much debated. No other treatment except excellent insulin therapy has demonstrated both safety and efficacy.  
<p>
PPAR agonists, specifically ligands for the PPAR-gamma subtype, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), have well known effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, playing an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, they also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory characteristics, e.g. in vitro studies have shown that TZDs can suppress nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) which in turn serves to reduce interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion by T cells,  thereby inducing T cell apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of TZDs in several autoimmune animal models, including prevention of diabetes in the NOD mouse, and reducing disease activity in mice/rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Supportive data are also available in human clinical trials.  One small study in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) showed that 7 patients treated with Rosiglitazone and insulin maintained their endogenous insulin secretion over 18 months, whereas 7 individuals treated with insulin alone had significantly less residual insulin secretion. TZD treatment of patients with IBD has also been shown to ameliorate their disease, and promising preliminary results have been reported following TZD treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.
<p>
<b>Capability Statements:</b>  A Selection Committee will use the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The narrative portion of the Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.
<p>
The capability statement should include details on the PPAR agonist's availability to be administered to a population from 8 to 18 years, including options for administering the agent in a dose adjusted for body weight; details on provision of placebo; detailed plans demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the therapeutic agent and placebo in a timely manner for the duration of the study; as well as the ability to provide technical and/or financial support to facilitate the scientific goals, including support for a study nurse.  Additional information such as proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of the PPAR agonist, proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic therapy of young patients will be considered.  The statement must address a willingness to publish research results promptly and the ability to be bound by a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), and substantially as found at <b>http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/ICTCRADA2005.pdf </b>.
<p>
CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA Collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The Collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and occasionally funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA and makes contributions that may qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
<p>
<b>DATES: </b> Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before October 11, 2005, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicant's own expense to discuss with the Collaborator Selection Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study.
<p>
<b>FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS:</b> <p>  Capability statements should be submitted to <p>Rochelle S. Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 9000 Rockville Pike, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, phone: (301) 451-3636, fax: (301) 402-7461, e-mail: Rochelle.Blaustein@nih.gov.   <p>For scientific inquiries contact Kristina Rother, M.D., Senior Staff Clinician, at kr58q@nih.gov  or Tel: 301-402-3905.  <p>Capability Statements may be submitted by e-mail with attachments, by facsimile at the number above, by mail, or by overnight courier so long as they are received by the posted deadline.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Software Products
<DESC>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to award contracts/orders on a competitive basis, when feasible, for purchases exceeding $25,000 for brand name software products as specified below.  This brand name notice is for software products identified herein for the next five years (Fiscal Years 2005 through 2010).  This notice is NOT an Request for Bids and will not be issued again until Fiscal Year 2011.  FNS administers the nutrition assistance programs of the USDA, whose mission is to provide children and needy families with better access to food and a more healthful diet through its food assistance programs and comprehensive nutrition education efforts.  Two areas of assistance provided are the Food Stamp Program (FSP) and the Special Nutrition Programs (SNP), which includes the Child Nutrition Programs, including the School Breakfast and School Lunch programs; the Nutrition Education and Training Program; the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the WIC Farmer’s Market Nutrition Program; the Commodity Supplemental Food Program; the Food Distribution Program; the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations; the Nutrition Program for the Elderly and The Emergency Food Assistance Program.  USDA Enterprise Architecture (EA): USDA is implementing a “cooperative approach” to enterprise architecture.  Using this approach, agency architectures are directed towards mission-specific processes, systems, data and applications.  The Departmental component is directed at: Infrastructure investments (e.g. security and telecommunications); Cross-cutting investments (e.g. corporate systems); and Areas where there are significant economies of scale from a Departmental approach.  All hardware/ software areas must align with the USDA & FNS EA.  Currently, FNS is developing an enterprise approach to managing and supporting its network and infrastructure.  The quantity of data being collected and managed has greatly increased.  FNS must reduce short and long term cost by developing an enterprise architectural methodology. The hardware appliances and software systems will improve the operational efficiency, planning and coordination of FNS infrastructure and serve as a template for future management of FNS networks and agency programs.  If the agency uses this approach would benefit: Project planning and communication among stakeholders; Interface with new and legacy systems; Facilitation of data entry accuracy; Generation of standardized reports; Reduction of troubleshooting efforts by saving time to correct errors and issues; Minimization of duplication of hardware and software; and, Facilitation of field and regional office operations.  The primary objectives of the Information Technology Division (ITD) are to improve operational efficiency, planning, coordination, and to standardize the agency’s IT environment and agency programs, among headquarters, regional, and field offices to analyze program effectiveness, to evaluate performance metrics and to standardize many of the program functions. Security--Microsoft Patchmeister, Overtone Software, Managetone Master Server, MSDN Subscriptions, Symantec Norton Anti-Virus Support (HQ & RO) Plus Fee – Renewal, NCisco IOS, Routers and Switches, Cisco Intrusion Detection Software, Oracle Database Software, ASG Software IDMS Data Transfer, License Renewal for ASG, Crystal Reports, NetQOS Network Analyzer Maintenance, Citrix Remote Access, and Webinspect Software and Training.  In order to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), OIG and OMB network security requirements to secure information and systems, FNS will implement nCircle IP360 Vulnerability Management System and Cisco Pik Firewall appliances.  These appliances will determine the applications, services, operating systems, protocols and vulnerabilities that may put major applications such as STARSII, ALERT and all other IP enabled devices attached to the LAN/WAN at risk and provide mitigation techniques to remediate vulnerabilities.  Networking Products--Cisco Router, Switches, Firewalls, and NetQos.  FNS has chosen Cisco Router, Switches, and NetQos to manage, support, and secure its network, backbone and infrastructure. These Cisco devices are proprietary and do not operate with other vendor platforms because its network and infrastructure equipment is proprietary and does not operate with other vendor networking hardware and software equipment.  FNS has tested and researched the Cisco Systems network communications equipment and found that this vendor best meets the missions and goals of the agency.  Cisco System provides priority controlled technical support through their Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for current equipment and legacy systems.  NetQos is a network monitoring tool that allows you to monitor traffic across all WAN and LAN links down to the application level by making use of Cisco Systems NetFlow architecture.  Microsoft Premiere Support, Operating System, Application Software, and Microsoft Office Suite.  In continuing an effort to develop enterprise methodology to manage and support its network and infrastructure, standardize all systems of collecting and managing data, FNS must reduce short and long term cost. The agency will sole source the Microsoft Premiere Support directly to Microsoft for the following reasons:  Microsoft support services has direct access to Microsoft software developers and source code for current and future products.  This direct access is unique and invaluable to FNS.  This direct access to both current and future product issues plays a key role in allowing Microsoft Support Services to have unique insight into the architecture of current solutions today which can facilitate smooth migrations to future unreleased products/versions based on our in-depth access to Microsoft internal resources. Microsoft Premier Support staff has a direct path to Microsoft software developers and engineers to quickly address product support, trouble-shooting and hot-fix type issues.  Microsoft support services can immediately establish a valuable technology feedback link between FNS and Microsoft development teams to help shape the future direction, features and functionality of forthcoming products.  Premier Support staffs have been instrumental in facilitating important new product features/functionality to be considered and implemented based on direct feedback from FNS.  After working with Microsoft for several years, Microsoft has gained a detail expert knowledge and understanding of our network system, topology, and applications.  Syncsort & NetApp Backup Solution: Syncsort software is the agency-wide backup solution, this software is proprietary and other backup software solution cannot read Syncsort tapes.  Included with the Syncsort backup solution is the NetApp Filers which is a proprietary piece of equipment.  The NetApp Operating System uses the snap shot and snap mirror technology to capture an exact copy to a file server data and files. This process makes the NetApp Filers one of the few unique backup solution in the industry.  There are approximately two other vendors which uses this method however, each of those vendor products are not compatible to the other (this also includes NetApp).  This snap shot capability data is snapped mirrored (copied) to a remote site. The tape backup is no longer needed, everything is disk to disk.  VMware (ACE)--VMware ACE gives FNS administrators the ability to lock down PC endpoints and protect critical company resources against the risks presented by unmanaged PCs. With VMware ACE, FNS administrators package an IT-managed PC within a secured virtual machine and deploy it to an unmanaged physical PC. Once installed, VMware ACE provides a secured and IT-compliant PC endpoint enabling safe access to IT resources.  If FNS changes vendors all enterprise applications and confidential data can be accessed by an increasing number of unmanaged PCs used by contractors, outsourcers, telecommuters, and partners. Unmanaged PCs are not owned or maintained by IT and therefore present increased costs and security risks to FNS enterprise.  Consistency with technology, service, support, and durability of equipment is most important to the government. No other vendor can offer these options.  Rational Suite AnalystStudio--Rational Suite AnalystStudio integrates a combination of tools for business, application and data modeling, requirements and use case management, defect and change request tracking, and best-practice process guidelines. It also includes the Rational Suite Team Unifying Platform, an integrated platform for the cross-functional team. The tools that make up the Analyst Studio are Rational Unified Process, Rational Rose (Professional Data Modeler), Rational RequisitePro, Rational ClearQuest, Rational TestManager, Rational ClearCase LT, Rational SoDA.  The Tools in the suite integrate with each other providing for accountability for each phase of an application lifecycle whether it is to track defects or enhancements.  There are currently no tools on the market that provide integration from requirements tracking to production for configuration management implementation.  The purpose of these specific hardware and software systems is to provide a standard approach to record, collect, visualize, analyze and report information to cooperating and regulatory entities.  These software applications and support agreements will allow the agency to meet their mission and goals throughout the program areas.  Qualified firms offering these software products may respond by submitting product catalogs to FNS, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22302.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN05-38 - Wireless Network after Next Program Proposer's Day
<DESC>PROPOSER’S DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host a Proposer’s Day Workshop in support of the Wireless Network after Next program on September 15th, 2005 at George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, 3401 North Fairfax Drive, Room 244, Arlington, VA; beginning at 8:30am and lasting until 2:30pm.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) program, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program will be released prior to the conference.

The WNaN program seeks to develop and demonstrate technologies and system concepts that will enable intelligent adaptive wireless networks consisting of densely deployed low cost wireless nodes.  The premise of the WNaN program is that significant advantages can be realized by densely deploying low cost nodes which have been jointly optimized with network operations. WNaN networks should adapt to changing conditions by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the nodes to reduce the demands on the nodes, in particular on the physical and link layers.  By working around the limitations of the low-cost nodes that form the network, and by utilizing the rich interconnection fabric created by dense deployment, the WNaN network should provide reliable and highly available battlefield communications at a low system cost.

Previous practice has been to build high cost and hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes. This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density.

The objective of Phase 1 is the development of a proof-of-concept wireless demonstration platform using readily-available low cost hardware components.  Later phases will refine the platform using new components as they become available.

WNaN wireless nodes should be based on an RF processing circuit which can be replicated to form a variety of network radio capabilities, such as MIMO, dynamic spectrum, multiple-channel beam-forming, and nulling.  Although this phase will not require the development of new networking technology, WNaN nodes developed in Phase 1 should be able to form a small ad hoc wireless network and simultaneously participate in a 100BaseT network.  In addition, WNaN wireless nodes should serve as platforms for subsequent development of adaptive network technology in later phases.  Phase 1 proof-of-concept wireless nodes should be traceable to a production unit with an expected large quantity procurement cost to the Government of no more than $500 per unit.

Later phases of this program will integrate these wireless nodes and follow-on designs with technologies developed in other DARPA programs: control/adaptive technologies developed by Control-Based Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (CB-MANET); spectrum agility technologies developed by neXt Generation Communications (XG); spatial diversity, beam-forming, and other MIMO technologies developed by Mobile Network MIMO (MNM); rapid link acquisition technologies developed by Connectionless Networking (CN); and the store-and-forward and routing technologies developed by Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN); as well as other DARPA-developed technologies such as MEMS filters.

The specific objectives of Phase 1 and the program concept for later phases will be presented at the Proposer’s Day meeting.

DARPA currently plans to solicit proposals for wireless platforms for Phase 1 only at this time.  

DARPA anticipates that Phase 1 of the Wireless Network after Next program will be unclassified.

Performance Work Statement General Information This Contract is to provide 1) subject indexing of materials related to the adjudication of claims; 2) regulatory history and Citator tracing by subject matter for portions of Title 38 CFR through various earlier VA regulations and documents; 3) attachment verification and quality check on all Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BVA) decisions, including verifying and associating all Vacated, Corrected and Reconsidered decisions with the earlier version, scanning unavailable decisions, preparing an electronic file of unavailable decisions, transmitting the electronic file, and providing an edit list of problems for correction by BVA; 4) maintain Infobases in a format that can be uploaded into Folio version 3.1; 5) Consulting and Programming support to be defined by task orders; and 6) secure storage of data in electronic and microform formats. The BVA Research Center contains a large archive of current and historical administrative materials.  These materials are not adequately retrieved by the usual bibliographic identification.  Basically it is of little use to know that there are 63 binders of VA forms when you need to obtain only one specific form.  VADEX allows you to identify and locate such specific record information. Invoices will be submitted quarterly and will be paid in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.   Progress meetings may be held, usually quarterly.  Efforts will be made to resolve all matters by e-mail or phone before having a meeting. Contractor is not expected to work in the BVA facility but access is provided when necessary to complete the work. Please identify the skills of key personnel and include the percentage of time those key personnel will be available for this Contract. Definitions BVA – Board of Veterans’ Appeals CO – Contracting Officer COR – Contracting Officer’s Representative VA – Department of Veterans Affairs VACOLS – Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System Government Furnished Property and Services The Government will provide containers suitable for the transportation of documents and computer disks or tapes.  The Government will provide access to VACOLS, Computer Assisted Legal Research, and appropriate research facilities.  VACOLS access will be on the VA Virtual Private Network.   Contractor Furnished Property and Services Contractor will provide all computers and related equipment to access the databases provided and to prepare the required files.  Contractor will provide pickup and delivery of physical materials.  Contractor will provide e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers.  Contractor will provide Broadband Access to the Internet.   Contactor personnel who have access to the VA computer systems will be required to complete annual Cyber Security training, which will take approximately one hour.  Contractor personnel who have access to decisions in any format must complete annual Privacy Awareness training, which will take approximately one hour.  Training will be available online, by videotape or at the BVA offices, as is most convenient to the Contractor personnel.  Contractor personnel must provide signed certification of completion to the CO during each year of the contract. Contractor must properly dispose of unredacted documents, using shredder or other document destruction device. Contractor will provide personnel capable of indexing using a controlled vocabulary in English; maintaining a controlled vocabulary in English; researching and documenting the history of a specific subject regulated by the VA in English; Contractor personnel who have access to VA computer systems will be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Office of Security and Law Enforcement prior to contract performance.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for their connectivity to the VA computer network and ensure that any connected computer equipment meets VA standards relating to security. The BVA reserves the right to make additional copies, or portions thereof, as it deems necessary and the Contractor shall have no claim for additional copies.  Specific Tasks Item 1 – Indexing (VADEX):  Provide infobase and print index to materials relevant to BVA adjudication; vocabulary control (specific subject matter); quarterly electronic updates; three copies of annual print edition of the controlled vocabulary, including all references, reciprocals, and logical categories; advance sheets showing the indexing completed for each document; sequentially numbered documents which are determined by the Research Center staff to be not relevant to adjudication are recorded in an Adjunct file to assure that all documents have been reviewed; quarterly listing of missing numbers for each series of sequentially numbered documents.  Expired items are deleted from the database.  Superseded items are indexed under their current reference. Item 2 – Citator (Regulatory History):  Provide quarterly electronic updates to infobase, microfiche and three copies of annual print Citator.  A special Project under Item 5 may involving providing a searchable electronic file hotlinked to image file, text file or website. . Also, as a special project under Item 5, temporarily maintain a complete paper file of any recreated regulatory history to be used to create an electronic legislative history.  Annual print Citator provides a shelf list for the microfiche regulatory histories. When preparing a regulatory history, it is preferred to use the image of the original document rather than a retyped or computer generated copy.  However, if the image of the original document is unavailable or not of a quality which will reproduce effectively, a retyped or computer generated copy may be substituted. Microfiche is currently created using updatable fiche jackets.  This is a continuous editing process sometimes resulting in the total revision of a recently completed history.  The current contractor maintains the updatable fiche jackets.  Any proposal should describe how the microfiche will be updated and how the masters will be maintained. The Research Center staff may develop some regulatory histories.  Those regulatory histories will be provided to Contractor for editing.  Since the specific question posted to the Research Center will have particular dates involved, it may be necessary for the Contractor to complete the tracing. Regulations are identified for tracing by three separate mechanisms:  (1) when a regulation is amended; (2) when the Research Center staff identifies a regulation as requiring an update; and (3) when there is an anticipated need for an untraced section to be traced.  The majority of regulations are identified as a result of an amendment made in the Federal Register. Workload for Item 2 is expected to be high due to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA’s) Regulation Rewrite project.   Item 3 – Attachment Verification:  Work includes providing an error list, electronic files for uploading, machine-readable decisions for archiving, and weekly pickup and delivery of physical documents in paper or electronic format.  Weekly turn around of materials is required, with no more than three deliveries during the year being delayed.  The purpose of this item is to have a more accurate database of BVA decisions. The contractor will be provided with a paper copy of the dispatched decision and access to the archived decision in VACOLS.  The contractor will perform an integrity check for purposes of verifying that the paper decision matches both the archived decision and the VACOLS record in the following respects: 1.	in text,  2.	the listed Regional Office, 3.	the listed service dates and file numbers, and 4.	the listed representation, if any. The decision will be reviewed for internal errors such as whether “Conclusions of Law” section matches the “Issue”, “Introduction,” and “Findings of Fact” sections of decisions.  The decision also will be reviewed to determine whether any Personal Identifiers, as defined by the Privacy Act, are included.   The contractor will generate a weekly error report listing problems found that BVA personnel will then use to make corrections to the archived decisions When a BVA decision must be scanned by the contractor for purposes of attaching to VACOLS, certain edit checks are run against the scanned text, prior to transmitting it.  The scanned decisions are batched and transferred electronically in a flat file format.  Scanned decisions will be reviewed for Personal Identifiers, which will be redacted.   Any discrepancies are to be referred to BVA for resolution. Vacated, Reconsidered and Corrected Decisions constitute approximately 2 percent of decisions issued by the BVA.  These items are associated with the earlier decision in the archive.  This allows users of the archive to be aware of the later decision when reviewing the earlier one.   Workload varies due to priorities and changes in the law.  During the first 11 months of calendar 2004, 30,000 decisions were reviewed.  Approximately 2 percent required scanning or other special processing.  The Workload for Item 3 depends upon the number of decisions issued by the BVA.  The following chart shows the number of Appeals Decided for each of the last five years, as well as projections for the next two years.   Fiscal Year		FY2000	FY2001	FY2002	FY2003	FY2004	FY2005	  FY2006 Appeals Decided		  34,038	  31,557    17,231	  31,397    38,371   33,126*    32,224* 	*Projected Item 4 – Maintain Infobases for Use in Folio 3.1 Format:  Infobases of Chairman’s Memorandums, GC Precedential Opinions, CAVC Precedent Decisions, Research Center Shelflist, and Veteran’s Benefit Law Index.  Datafiles must be in a format which can be imported into Folio 3.1.  Datafiles are to be updated quarterly, unless there have been no changes to a particular database in the last quarter.  The materials are provided by e-mail or in the weekly pick-up.  The databases are currently maintained in Access. Item 5  – Consulting and Programming Support – Task Orders: Task Orders will be issued for special projects.  Examples of projects that might be completed are migrating a database to new software, creating an electronic regulatory history using the master data, or training BVA Staff in the use of the products. Item 6 – Secure Data Storage for Data and Products:  Materials will be stored on CD or microform, as appropriate.  The specific items involved include VADEX and CITATOR Archive Files, BVA Vocabulary Master Files, Citator microfiche master updatable fiche jackets, master microfiche of Research Center subject files, and Research Center shelflist.  Regulatory history materials available in print that may be required for scanning and electronic database conversion will be retained until the work is completed, or for no more than 9 months.

2.	SCOPE OF WORK:
2.1	INTENT: Contractor shall provide all necessary labor, material and equipment including crane service, water bladders & water weights with currently calibrated water meter, spreader beam with slings and a work boat to perform USCG weight tests of six (6) covered lifeboats, Four (4) Liferaft Davits and two (2) Rescue Boats & Davits. Pierside boats must be release tested either from a crane into the water or from the offshore davits. Pierside lifeboat davits must be weight tested using water weights slung from a spreader beam. Liferaft davits and Rescue Boat davits are single point lifts, no spreader beam required. All offshore boats can be weight tested and release tested directly into the water without removal from davits. All release hooks require testing under full load.Weight of each boat varies slightly. Weight tests will be conducted at 100% weight versus 110% since no wires will be changed or end for ended. In the event that boats have to be stowed on the pier, contractor shall provide keel blocking and 6 screw stands per boat.

3.	WORK DESCRIPTION
3.1	Contractor shall design and fabricate a spreader beam with lifting points on top and beneath capable of  supporting thirty-thousand (30,000) pounds of dynamic load in motion coming to an abrupt stop. Spreader beam shall be used to weight test davits without boats and for removing boats from davits. The beam shall be weighed upon completion and the weight shall be welded onto the beam as a permanent marking.
3.2	Spreader beam shall become government property upon delivery of this item.
3.3	Spreader beam shall be approximately thirty-one ( 31 ) ft long. One set of top and bottom pick points shall be fourteen feet, seven and a half inches (14 ft-7.5) from the centerpoint of the beam. This represents the vertical pick point of the boats. Twelve additional  pick points shall be equally spaced on the bottom of the beam between the outer points and on the underside for supporting substitution weights. No weights will be allowed to be suspended from the beam by wrapping cable around the beam.
3.4	Boats may also be removed by means of a two legged sling. Each leg 29 ft 6 inches eye to eye minimum length. Capacity rated for 30,870 pounds. Lifting ends fitted with oval rings. Size 44mm dia x 270mm inside length x 190 mm inside width as shown in the lifeboat manual page 9-1 & 9-2.
3.5	Contractor shall give COTR  72 hours minimum  notice to notify USCG for   weight testing.
3.6	When weight and release testing boats on the offshore side, contractor should be cognizant of timing release tests to coincide with minimum current action along the hull. All boats shall be tethered to the falls to prevent boats from getting away.
3.7	All six covered lifeboats have a hoisting restriction of no more than 3 crewmen in the boat. Boats weight tested and release tested under full load cannot be brought home until weight is removed as per the Schat Watercraft Lifeboat & Davit Manuals.
3.8	The COTR reserves the right to stop operations involving this item when unsafe practices exist relative to personnel and/or the ship's equipment.
3.9	Upon completion of testing, all boats shall be returned to their correct and original davits and stowed.
3.10	When water weights are used, USCG will insist on a currently calibrated water    meter. If bulk weight is used, USCG will insist on checking weights with a calibrated dynamometer.
3.11	The weight required for testing Liferaft davits is 4565 lbs. Weight  is to be suspended at the head of the davit and held by the brake. Weight is then allowed to freefall and brake applied for full stop.
3.12	Water bladders placed in lifeboats shall be symmetrically placed to prevent overstressed areas on the hull.
3.13	The following list of weights are for testing lifeboats either in the davits or for release testing by crane.
	Number 1 boat 13040 lbs of water.
	Number 2 & 3 boats 14399 lbs of water.
	Number 4 boat 13038 lbs of water
	Number 5 & 6 boat 14397 lbs of water.
3.14	The following weights are required for testing number 1, 3 & 5 davits without lifeboats in the falls. Number 1 boat davits 25423 lbs. Number 3 boat davits 26980 lbs. Number 5 boat davits 25371 lbs. MINUS the weight of the spreader beam.
3.15 The following weights are required for testing the rescue boats. Boat in davit, 1122 lbs in the boat. Davit without boat, 2844 lbs.

4.	PERFORMANCE CRITERIA/DELIVERABLES
4.1	Engineering calculations showing the capability of the spreader beam.
4.2	Certification of the Beam weight
4.3	Water meter calibration certificate
4.4	Dynamometer calibration certification if used.
4.5	Weight test of all lifesaving boats/davits to USCG satisfaction.

CLIN #	Description	
0001	5985PANTENNA. Due to recent failures on our existing AU-6 antenna controller which drives an 8' EMP 100 series tracking pedestal, we are attempting to replace the control unit to a more modern version as parts for the aging ACU-6 are hard to, if not impossible, to find.  Therefore, we require an antenna control unit that will interface with the existing pedestal.
1. Integration of the antenna control unit must wok with the existing series 100 EMP pedestal.
2. Integration will include all labor and materials necessary to interface the new antenna control unit to the existing antenna pedestal.
3. Power available for the antenna control unit will be120VAC 60 Hz, 20amp.
4. Schematics for the existing pedestal can and will be made available to assist in the integration process.
5. Down time for the integration must be kept to a maximum of 2 weeks(10 working days) in order to lessen the impact to the customers currently using this tracking antenna.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractor’s may submit a quotation. ***

***This is a brand name or equal procurement.   Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristic of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency requirement.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Tiger Optics, LLC Laser Hygrometer or technically equivalent product.***

All interested Contractor’s shall provide a quote for the following item: 

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Tiger Optics, LLC Laser Hygrometer , Model MTO-1001-H20 with 2-valve manifold gas inlet, Part Number F5002 or equivalent product. NIST requires a laser-based hygrometer for use as a check standard for tests performed using the NIST Low Frost-Point Generator (LFPG) and as a null detector for a new calibration service.  A technically equivalent laser hygrometer must meet the following specifications:

(A) General:

Sensing technique:The measured water vapor concentration must be determined by laser-absorption spectroscopy, with the exception that water vapor concentrations obtained by comparison of the spectroscopic measurements of the test gas to spectroscopic measurements of a second gas source are not permissible.

Environmental Requirements: The hygrometer must be capable of operating in an environment of 20 degrees C   plus/minus 10 degrees C, with relative humidity of 50 percent RH plus / minus 20 percent.  

Input line voltage requirements: The hygrometer shall operate on 110VAC, at 60 Hz, and draw less than 5 Amperes.

Sample line heating capability: Sample lines and valves shall withstand constant duty cycle temperature regulation at 60 degrees C.

Gas Sampling Inputs: Two gas-sampling inputs shall be supplied.  The inputs shall include a high-purity diaphragm valve on each leg and a bypass that vents a small fraction of the test gas when the valve is not opened, facilitating drydown.

Gas flow capacity: The maximum operating flow rate through the hygrometer shall be at least 2 standard liters per minute (SLM) of Nitrogen.

Inlet Pressure Capacity: The maximum allowable inlet pressure must be at least 50 pounds per square inch absolute pressure (PSIA).

Warranty:  Warranty shall be for 1 year including parts and labor.

(B) Hygrometer Performance Specifications:

Minimum Detection limit:  The minimum detectable water vapor concentration shall be 200 parts per trillion (PPT) mole fraction or less.

Sensitivity:  The sensitivity of the analyzer shall be 100 PPT or less.

Maximum detection capability:  The hygrometer shall be capable of measuring water vapor concentrations as high as 1 part per million.

Response time:  Response to 50 ppb step change shall be less than three minutes.

Accuracy:  Specified accuracy shall be the greater of plus / minus 4 percent of reading or plus / minus 100 ppt.

Stability of zero reading:  The analyzer response to a purified gas stream shall not drift by more than 100 PPT or the analyzer’s sensitivity specification, whichever is less.

Absolute zero:  The zero reading shall not be dependent on the measurement of an auxilliary “zero gas”, nor shall the analyzer zero be dependent on anything other than the spectroscopic technique employed by the analyzer.  

Hygrometer sensitivity to changes in laboratory environment:  Sensitivity of the hygrometer to changes in the laboratory temperature and humidity conditions, over the range specified in the general specifications section, shall be less than the sensitivity specification of the hygrometer.


( C ) Construction materials and methods:	

Wetted Materials:Wetted materials within the hygrometer must be compatible with making part per trillion measurements.  Generally, this means that components coming in contact with the test gas should be constructed of electro-polished, passivated 316L stainless steel, with a surface finish of 10 micro-inches RA (roughness average) or smoother.  The manufacturer of the hygrometer must disclose the manufacturer, part number, and material composition of all components containing non-electro-polished, stainless steel wetted surfaces, so that we may evaluate the potential degradation of performance due to their use.  

Use of elastomers / elastomeric seals:  No elastomers or elastomeric seals may be used in any way that contacts the test gas stream, including applications in which the elastomer does not directly contact the gas stream, but whose proximity to the stream might create a water vapor concentration gradient that could contribute water vapor to the test gas stream, as in face-sealing applications.  

Gas connections and tubing fittings:  All gas connections and tubing end fittings shall be ¼ inch diameter Swagelok VCR connections or equivalent metal face-seal fittings.  Tubing fittings employed to change the direction of tubing runs shall be Swagelok Micro-fit fittings, or equivalent. All fittings shall possess electro-polished and passivated interior surfaces as specified above.  

Construction of tubing runs:  Bends are not permitted in any tubing runs that contain test gas.  Changes in the direction of flow shall be accomplished by welding the appropriate fittings into the tubing run, as specified above.

Welding:  Tubing runs shall be orbital welded, consistent with current high-purity practices employed by the semiconductor processing industry.  

Leak rate of assembled components:  The maximum allowable leak rate is 2 x 10-8 mbar • liter /sec.

Sample cell insulation:  The sample cell shall be covered with thermal insulation to minimize measurement variations due to laboratory temperature fluctuations.

(D) Data handling / storage / outputs:

Computer Operating System:  Any internal computer must be compatible with NIST network security requirements.  For example, Windows 2000 or XP operating systems are acceptable.  Windows 98 is not.

Data Display:  The output graphical display shall be scalable by the user.  The minimum scale shall be from –200 ppt to 1 ppb or less.  See requirement for display of negative concentrations.

Provision for display and output of negative-vapor concentrations:  The hygrometer shall display (and store / transmit) negative water vapor concentrations that might normally result from measurements at very low water vapor concentrations.  

Internal Data Storage:  Any internal computer shall include minimum internal data storage capability of 3 gigabytes (20 preferred).

Analog outputs:  Analog outputs shall be supplied for each gas input channel.  Acceptable outputs are 0 to 10 VDC, 4-20 mA, or 0-20 mA.  The outputs shall be scalable with a minimum range corresponding to a water vapor concentration from –200 ppt to 1 part per billion.  

Data Transfer capability:  Any hygrometer that includes an integral computer shall include a USB port to enable transfer of all data.  Any hygrometer that does not contain an integral computer shall be supplied with an IEEE-488 interface or USB port enabling full control of all instrument parameters and transfer of all data to an external computer

The VA plans to award a one year base and 4 option years. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 05-05. The associated NAICS Code work shall be performed under is 541611 with a size standard restriction of 6 million. This acquisition is a service-disabled veteran owned set aside.  The provisions at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items apply to this solicitation.  Offerors are responsible for returning a copy of the Representation and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3 with their proposal.  A copy of the provision can be obtained at www.arnet.gov .  Commercial items FAR clauses 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, and 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  All Contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to being awarded a contract.  Contractors are responsible for the accuracy of information added to CCR.  To register go to http://www.ccr.gov/.    Description of Services The VA is seeking a firm or individual to provide advice and assistance in resolution of existing and emerging financial management and financial systems problems associated with VA‘s Revolving Supply Fund accounting data resident within the Department’s Financial Management System (FMS) and other related VA financial systems.  This a firm fixed price contract. The period of performance date of award to September 30, 2006.(base year) and four option years.  The estimated annual hours associated with the tasks listed below are 150.hours. Task Order Number 1:  Reconcile: the Statement of Transactions (SF-224), Budgetary versus Proprietary accounts, and applied costs versus accrued expenditures on a monthly basis. Place of Order:  Contractor’s location and possibly Austin Finance Center Required Travel:  Optional, but one trip to Austin Finance Center authorized. Travel will be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. Please list travel as a separate item. Estimated hours (maximum):  50 Background:  VA’s system of accounting for receipts and disbursements is multi-dimensional: First, the VA general ledgers (FMS) are designed to capture activity with the US Treasury (VA’s Bank) in specific accounts.  The accounts are structured with internal formula checks to highlight the accuracy of the postings.  The integrity of these accounts needs to be tested at each level (Fund, station, budget fiscal year) to prove that postings occurred properly. Second, the monthly activity, as captured in VA’s general ledgers, need to be reported accurately to the US Treasury on the Statement of Transactions (SF-224).  Any differences will result in a receipt or outlay out of balance between the VA and Treasury on the Statement of Budget Execution (SF-133). Third, the receipts and disbursements flowing through the US Treasury monthly must match the activity reported for that month in VA’s general ledgers.  Otherwise, VA will receive a Statement of Differences (SF-6652) from the US Treasury, which must be reconciled and corrected. Fourth, the resulting Fund Balance with Treasury on VA’s Financial Statements must agree to the penny with Treasury’s Cash Balance for the Supply Fund. Description of the Work:  The Supply Fund is a multi-billion dollar fund with thousands of transaction occurring daily that affect VA’s general ledgers.  The scope of financial activity, and the number of individuals entering transactions, means errors are likely.  The monthly reconciliation effort will identify and correct out-of balance differences, and recommend accounting practices and policies to avoid further repetition of erroneous entries.  On going monthly analysis will occur to ensure that corrective measures are effective. Computer Time Required:  As required to perform duties and responsibilities. Security:  Unclassified Tasks:  Monthly, analyze and crosswalk Supply Fund budgetary and proprietary accounts to insure proper recording of cash entries.  Identify other sources of out-of-balance conditions and recommend transactions or other accounting procedures. Deliverables:  Monthly reconciliation reports for each element identified in the Task Order.  Documentation:  As required to support the deliverables. Task Order Number 2:  Participate in the VA’s Mock and Annual Close exercise insuring that closing entries for VA Revolving Supply Fund are correct. Place of Work:  VA’s Financial Service Center in Austin, Texas Required travel:  One, and perhaps two, trips to the Austin Finance Center Estimated Hours (maximum):  100 Background:  At the end of each fiscal year, the VA, like all Departments in the Federal government, are required to close out accounting activity as of September 30.  This process requires analysis of all general ledger accounts and funds within an operating account to insure that the proper closing balances are achieved.   The VA conducts a mock close in late August, during which accounts are analyzed, variances and errors corrected, and other preparations are made for the actual close which occurs on September 30, 2005. Security:  Unclassified Tasks:  Participate in VA’s mock and annual close exercises. Deliverables:  Provide recommendations as to corrective entries in response to identified accounting errors or out-of-balance situations.  Provide a report on the post close condition of all general ledger accounts and funds making up the Supply Fund account. Documentation:  As required to support the deliverables. Evaluation Criteria The objective of this procurement is to choose a single “best value” proposal that provides trade-offs that are advantageous to the Government.  The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate offers in order of descending order of preference: Understanding the requirements 	The degree to which the Offeror’s technical approach reflects a clear understanding of the detail requirements listed in the statement of work and a reasonable, well-thought-out approach that is likely to yield the required results within the required time frame.    Project Management / Professional Staff 	The degree to which the Offeror’s quote reflects corporate or proposed staff experience identical to, similar to, or related to the requirement.  Past Performance 	The degree to which past performance evaluations, either included in the quote or identified by the evaluators in any other manner, reflect success in developing systems similar in scope and kind to that listed in the SOW.   NOTE:  All offerors must provide three references to be used for the evaluation of this factor.  References must include:  •	Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,  •	Name of the Point of Contact (POC), •	POC Telephone Number, •	POC Email address,  •	Contract Number, •	Period of Performance,  •	Scope of Work. Price/Cost	The degree to which the proposed cost/price is reasonable, realistic, and competitive.     1.	Understanding the Requirements 2.	Project Management / Professional Staff  3.	Past Performance 4.	Cost Understanding the Requirements is the most significant criteria of all.  Cost of the Offeror is the least significant factor.  If in evaluating proposals it is determined that an Offeror misrepresented its capabilities, it could be a significant factor in both the evaluation and the contracting officer's responsibility determination. Due Dates All offers must be received no later than 2:00 PM EST, September 15, 2005. Offers must be sent electronically via email to: Patricia.Ellis@va.gov

The technical evaluation factors are of greater importance when compared to price, therefore, the Government will utilize Best Value procedures in making the award.   Offerors are to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, with their response.

<DESC>Amendment 002, only changes have been included.
The REVISED TIME for the site visit is 0830-1500 on 01 September 2005.

1. Other than the facility walk through, is the time allocated for product demonstrations?
Answer: No, due to facility time constraints there will not be time allowed for product demonstration and no product literature will be accepted in conjunction with the site visit. Anything that vendors bring will not be considered as part of the evaluation.

5.  Will vendors be required to supply information to NMCSD prior to visit for base access? What is required to gain access to the facility, if it is located on a military installation? To whom do we send this information?
Answer: Providing information (Company name, Representative(s) name(s), and vehicle make/model (if possible) and expected arrival time to the base) to NMCSD prior to visit is required. NMLC requires either a DUNS or a CAGE number to verify CCR registration. Required information will be sent to rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil. NMCSD is located on a military installation. For base access each visitor will be required to present a valid Driver’s License or other valid Picture ID.

6.  After reviewing the plan, I've noticed that the symbols are very difficult to differentiate from one another. Will there be someone at the site walk with the technical knowledge to answer design questions, and clearly define the plan symbols?
Answer: NMLC will have two representatives present and NMCSD will have at minimum one technical subject matter expert to provide the required clarifications and answer questions.
However, all questions are still required to be sent to NMLC in written format (email ONLY) by 3:00 PM EST 02 Sept 2005.
7.  Is this a small business set aside or are large businesses encouraged to attend?
Answer: This is a full and open competition; all businesses that meet the basic criteria are encouraged to participate.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR TRACE GAS ANALYZER SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to: A. Answer the questions the following questions submitted to the combined synopsis and solicitation.   1.  In item 3.0 paragraph 2 it states that a split/splitless injector is required for the inlet that contains the PDHID detector.  With the samples that you intend to analyze a gas sampling valve is normally used but is not called for in the Statement of Work.  A gas tight syringe may also be used instead of a valve.	May a gas tight syringe be used? 		Answer:  No, only the gas sampling valves are acceptable. 2. The request specifies Hayesep as a type of column.  This term is often used in the generic sense.	Does this mean that only Hayesep columns may be used, or are equivalents allowed?   Answer:  Equivalents are allowed. 3. No specific column dimensions are mentioned for the molesieve and porous polymer columns.  Does this mean we should select the column dimension and specifications according to our best judgment/suggestion?   Answer:  Yes. 4.  The phrase "column for hydrocarbon gas analysis" is a bit vague.  If you tell us which hydrocarbons you wish to analyze, we can better select an appropriate column, whether it be packed or capillary.   Answer:  The hydrocarbons to be analyzed are acetylene, ethane, ethylene, methane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, propylene. 5. On the data system, we read the request to mean that a data system (PC and software) be included.  Is this correct, or do we mealy have to be able to connect to another data system?   Answer:  Just able to connect to another system (Ethernet preferred). B. Amend the Statement of Work as follows: The second paragraph of Section 3 of the Statement of Work is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:   The instrument must be equipped with a Pulsed Discharge Helium Ionization Detector (PDHID) and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID).	The contaminants to be identified by PDHID are: hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. The detectors must be on separate data acquisition channels and must be able to operate concurrently.  The instrument must be equipped with two independent gas inlet systems.  The PDHID inlet will be equipped with head pressure control, programmable split ratio control, septum purge, helium purge gas injection valve.  The FID inlet must be a six port automated gas sampling valve.  The instrument is required to have electronic flow control and a gas purifier to remove carrier gas impurities.  The instrument must be delivered with a molesieve and hayesep columns for the PDHID, and a column for hydrocarbon gas analysis for the FID.   The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 1:30 CST on September 7, 2005. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on September 7, 2005.

QUESTION: During our site visit, there was some concern about the size of drainage boxes and was discussed with POC Bourdeaux. The size of the drainage boxes was not stipulated in the SOW. I would like to clarify that information in order to determine that the pricing was accurate...Please advise.

RESPONSE: The size of the drain boxes should be 24 inch cubed. Paragraph 7, Specific Tasks, of the RFQ has been revised to specify the size of the drain boxes.

Quotes in response to this synopsis/solicitation may be submitted to be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 3:00 p.m. EST, August 31, 2005.  


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is TIRSE-05-Q-00047, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05. This acquisition is set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is: 561730, and the small business size standard is: $6 Million.

This will be an all or none award based on the lowest price quoted from a responsive, responsible quoter. Quotes will be considered only from quoters who are regularly established in the business relevant to the scope of work to be performed. Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (refer to below Preparation and Submission of quotes, paragraph 3) to be awarded this contract.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) request a quotation for the following service for the period effective from date of award through a completion date to be coordinated between IRS and the contractor:

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK

1. BACKGROUND

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in need of services to correct an erosion problem at the Memphis Internal Revenue Service Center (MIRSC) at 5333 Getwell Rd., Memphis, TN.

The general facility layout includes retention ponds that are designed to catch the storm water runoff. As a result of runoff entering the ponds due to the steep grading, there are areas of erosion starting to appear. These areas are concentrated around the perimeter of the facility at the fence line and at the retention/dry ponds. 

Perimeter (fence line) erosion: The erosion between two gates (gates 3 & 4) is concentrated at the fence line where the water drains to the ditch on the north end of the property. Because there is a high volume of water leaving the property at this location, the ground under the fence is eroding. This is creating deep ‘ravines’ or cuts into the ground where the water is heaviest. 

Dry Ponds: The dry ponds are normally dry; however since they serve as secondary containment during periods of heavy rainfall, they may have water in them that will need to be removed at the time of scheduled work start. In this area, the steep grading is contributing to the erosion on both sides of the ponds. This is also causing the fence post concrete anchors to become exposed. The bottom of the dry pond will require leveling to restore proper drainage, as the soil runoff has deposited in this area and created high spots which prevent drainage. 

Retention Ponds: Around the ponds on the facility, there is rip rap to prevent erosion. The area between the grass and the rip rap is staring to erode, and the dirt has been carried down into the lower rip rap. Rip rap is needed in these areas is to fill in the thin spots. Additional rip rap is needed around the perimeter of the ponds to fill in the eroded area.

2. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The Contractor shall perform all work under this contract at the MIRSC at 5333 Getwell Road Memphis, TN  38118. Work shall commence September 12, 2005. The completion date will be coordinated between the contractor and the IRS contact based on the approved schedule (refer to paragraph 8, Schedule of Work, below).

3. GROUNDS ACCESS HOURS

a. Normal duty hours of the MIRSC are from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, daily, Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. The facility will be available to the contractor during normal duty hours.

The contractor will not work on Federal holidays, or any other day designated by Federal Statute, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation, except if requested and authorization is granted from the IRS contact. 

b. Government personnel observe the following listed days as a holiday:

New Year's Day	Martin Luther King, Jr's. Birthday (observed)
President's Day	Memorial Day
Independence Day	Labor Day
Columbus Day	Veteran's Day

Any other day designated by Federal Statute, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation.

4. GENERAL

a. Identification of Contractor Employees

The contractor shall provide to the IRS contact a list of names, and dates of birth of personnel who will be on-site performing work under this contract. This list shall be provided with the Schedule of Work (refer to paragraph 8 below).

•	Install a ‘berm” along the fence line to direct water into the basins to prevent future erosion (to the maximum extent practicable) and deflect water back to the drain boxes. 
•	Install Bermuda sod over the top soil.
•	Place rip rap around the drainage boxes to prevent dirt from entering the drains. 

NOTE: Gates 3 & 4 - This area covers approximately 350’ along the fence line. 
 
DRY PONDS. At dry Ponds #1 & #2, on West fence line, the contractor shall:
•	Backfill with dirt to reduce grade at both fence line and road side of ponds to reduce the potential for erosion.
•	Lay Bermuda sod with staples over backfill dirt. 
•	Form new backfill into current pond drainage slopes, correcting any current grading deficiencies which prevent proper drainage. 

Regrading in this area, creating a less severe angle of decline, will help the erosion issue. 

Pond #1: This pond perimeter is 700’, plus an additional 100’ of fence line that needs to be built up.

RETENTION PONDS

Retention Pond #1. The contractor shall:
•	Lay rip rap inside fence perimeter over eroded areas to prevent further erosion and provide security from entry via openings in the fence at ground level. 
•	Build up existing rip rap at fence to level with bottom of fence line. 

Retention Pond #3. The contractor shall:
•	Place rip rap around the perimeter of the pond to fill in the areas where the erosion has created excessive gaps in the landscaping. 
•	Overlay rip rap over existing layers to fill in thin spots. 

NOTE: Pond #3 - This pond perimeter is 800’. 

The contractor shall add additional fill dirt as needed. 

RETENTION/DRY PONDS: Both ponds together equal approximately 1200’ perimeter. This area is in need of buildup that will change the grade to a gentle slope, which will require an advanced knowledge of the grading principles to estimate the backfill required. 

8. SCHEDULE OF WORK

<SOLNBR>W9124R-05-T-0050
<RESPDATE>090605
<ARCHDATE>11052005
<CONTACT>Laura St. John, 928-328-6124
<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer ten questions received in response to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation number W9124R-05-T-0050 for Study of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) test methodologies. * Q1)  What is the depth of the methodology you are looking for? In other words, what types of UAV systems?  A1)  UAV systems may range from hand-launched systems such as the Pointer, Raven and Desert Hawk, to platforms the size of Hunter (30-ft wingspan, 2,000 lbs).  Sensor and weapon integration and testing form the basis of the larger UAV interest.  Nothing on  the order of the Global Hawk is envisioned.  Fixed wing and rotorcraft are to be considered.    * Q2)  Does this tie to an integration of technology to test in NAS?  A2) Testing in national airspace is not to be considered at this time. * Q3) There are several ORDS and TOPS on UAVs, do wish to incorporate the goals in those documents into the test method?  A3) As noted in the specification, This document will identify testing methods and techniques necessary to demonstrate the degree to which Critical Technical Parameters (CTPs) and/or Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), as specified in the Operational Requi rements Document (ORD), the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), System Evaluation Plan (SEP), and other requirements documents, can be met.  I'm unaware of an existing UAV TOP; incorporating that into the study would obviously be very helpful. * Q4)  The types of UAVs you list in the SOW are very simple platforms. Would you want the methodology to leave open methods for testing more complex UAVs (i.e.: w/weapons)?  A4) Yes - testing sensor and weapons systems should be included.     * Q5)  Would you need the methodology to setup methods by Class or tier?  A5) Classifying UAVs in different classes or tiers may be helpful.  One could consider Raven-, Shadow-, Hunter-, and  helicopter-class categories, for example, based mostly on vehicle size.  Other categories could be included if necessary.  Various UAV exa mples can be found at http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf * Q6)  Are the ORDs, CTPs and TEMPS available for review before the offers are submitted?  A6) One related to UAVs can be found at http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/uav_tcs_ord.htm.  Sample performance parameters for a UAV are listed in http://www.vtol.org/uavpaper/NavyUAV.htm.  Many documents are in draft form or are For Official Use Only,  and in general, can not readily be distributed. * Q7) Do you want Range safety parameters?  A7) Safety considerations are generally in place at the test ranges, and do not require special consideration at this time.  * Q8)  Do you want parameters for evaluating multiple integrated technologies or simply for a platform as-is? A8) I'm unclear on what multiple integrated technologies implies.  This study supports developmental test, not operational test, and systems are usually tested on a system-by-system basis. * Q9) The link to the TOPs web site listed in the SOW just brings up a list of ITOPs documents, which are not viewable or downloadable.    A9) A copy of a TOPs will be posted at:  http://www.yuma.army.mil/contracting/rfq.html#05-T-0050.  The TOPs is shown merely as an example.  There is no implication that the format, style or testing procedures should be copied.   * Q10) Is there an incumbent contractor already performing this work at USAYPG? A10) No.
