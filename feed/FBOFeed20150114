<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force intends to solicit Thales Visionix, Inc. on a sole-source basis to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the procurement of Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion <sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment to support the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The proposed NAICS Code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, which has a corresponding size standard of 750 employees.</p>

<p>This effort is to procure Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment for the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The Contractor will have to develop and perform testing and evaluation in order to diagnose, repair and/or replace various parts of the HMCS equipment. The contractor will also need to provide various reports and records to help improve program sustainability,&nbsp;knowledge, and capability. Due to the proprietary nature of this requirement, the Contractor must have applied knowledge of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment</p>

<DESC>Headquarters Kosovo Force (HQ KFOR) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for Dining Facility (DFAC) Services for Camp Film City (Pristina) and Camp Nothing Hill (Leposavic), Kosovo.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 3) have performed at least two contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation with a minimum duration of six months, and 4) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-ACO-KFOR-15-03.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to obtain a comprehensive high-quality catering service, including related supplies and services, for multi-national personnel located in Camp Film City, Camp Nothing Hill, and associated areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the NATO member governments nominate potential prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms should request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 18 February 2015</p>
<p>IFIB release: 02 March 2015 (planned)</p>
<p>Bid closing: 20 May 2015 (projected)</p>
<p>Period of Performance: One base year (01 October 2015 - 30 September 2016) and four one-year options</p>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to create a revolutionary distributed planning capability to provide resilient command and control (C2) and manage complex military operations when communications are limited and unreliable. Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) will develop human-centered software decision aids that, based on commanderâ€™s intent, will assist operators throughout the C2 enterprise with controlling daily operations in a complex battlespace â€“ composing mission packages (coordinating across the network as needed), responding to emerging opportunities, and assessing progress towards achieving commanderâ€™s intent.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

<SUBJECT>DOD EMALL Multiple Award Schedule Solicitation
<SOLNBR>SP4708-15-R-0001
<CONTACT>Thomas E. Rosenthal, Contract Specialist, Phone (215) 737-0878, Email thomas.rosenthal@dla.mil -  Lisa Nienstedt, Contracting Officer, Phone  (215) 737-2201, Email lisa.neinstedt@dla.mil
<DESC>DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives. <br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. This solicitation is being issued as part of DLA's Multiple Award Schedule program using the guidance of FAR part 8.4 and DFARS 208.4. DLA's Multiple Award Schedule program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. DOD EMALL MASs will provide sustained direct vendor delivery (DVD) to customers worldwide, include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local).<br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for a period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis.<br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The estimated, minimum, and maximum contract dollar values shall be calculated for each successful offeror prior to making an award. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and COTS items matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system.<br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" (i.e. the number of business days after receipt of the order by the supplier that the customer will receive the items). Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies, or whose past performance providing the same supplies under similar conditions is insubstantial or indeterminable. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness.<br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements, and "Berry Amendment" (see DFARS 225.7002-1 as implemented by 10 U.S.C. 2533a, and clauses at DFARS 252.225-7012, 252.225-7015, and 252.225-7021).<br /><br />A draft copy of the solicitation is being made available by attachment to this synopsis. However, the final solicitation along with attachments will be made available via download from the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/.

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for the overhaul / repair of the PC-Based Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment FA-19200.  The PC-Based RVR System enables monitoring of visibility conditions on the runway as seen from the runway level.  This requirement will support AML-7000 Product Services Division at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK.

The proposed Fixed-Price contract is for all required labor, plant, parts, supplies, materials, fixtures, equipment, tools, test equipment, appropriate technical data and other facilities necessary to accomplish the overhaul / repair and test the government-owned items identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  The proposed contract is for the base year plus four option years.  

The Original Equipment Manufacturer, Vaisala Inc., Boulder CO, designed, produced, and currently provides repair and logistics support to the FAA for the PC-Based RVR system.  The logistics support is transitioning to the FAA Logistics Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  

As Vaisala Inc. holds the data rights and repair specifications, they are the only known source for the overhaul / repair of the PC-Based Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment FA-19200.   Therefore, the FAA does not have specifications or drawings available for release.

The intent of this announcement is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to provide the overhaul / repair of the PC-Based Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment FA-19200 an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities to provide such support.

Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior for further action by the FAA.

Interested parties who possess the necessary capabilities should respond with their documentation in writing to the Contract Specialist.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details / information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

All responses to this market survey quote must be received by Monday, January 19, 2015, 5:00 PM CST (Oklahoma Time).   All submittals should be submitted by email to:

<p>25 public parking spaces at reasonable market rates, as determined by the Lease Contracting Officer, must be available within 800 walkable feet of the employee entrance of the offered building.  The term "walkable" means that wheelchair-accessible pedestrian access, along code-compliant sidewalks and crosswalks, exists along the entire route.</p>
<p>Code compliant disabled parking consistent with ADA. The Government reserves the right to require additional disabled parking spaces (4-6), depending on the size of the space.</p>

<p>Prior to market survey, Federal Protective Service (FPS) will evaluate all interested buildings for security compliance. Crime rates, adjacent tenants and parking areas will all be factors in the evaluation. Buildings may not be solicited based on FPS evaluation.</p>
<p>Offered space that does not allow the following conditions to be met, may result in an inefficient layout determination by the Government:<br />a.	Contiguous space, all on one floor, not separated by common hallways or other areas.<br />b.	No interior ramps or stairs.<br />c.	Not more than twice as long as it is wide.<br />d.

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  Concrete <br> Batch Plant <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to initiate a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) negotiated modification to add multiple options for concrete production and delivery to Contract W911WN-14-C-0003 (the Contract) awarded to Joseph B. Fay Company (Fay), 100 Sky Lane, Tarentum, PA  15084-2807.  The Contract is for the construction of Monoliths M-22 to M-27, Charleroi Locks and Dam River Chamber.  <br>  <br> The proposed contract modification will add multiple options to the Contract to produce and deliver up to 55,000 cubic yards (cy) of concrete at a Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) batch plant.  Under the Contract, Fay is required to operate the GOCO batch plant to produce approximately 28,000 cubic yards of concrete and build six middle wall concrete monoliths (M22-M27). The batch plant is the only source for concrete production and delivery for the Charleroi Locks and Dam project.  If the Charleroi River Chamber Completion Contract (RCCC) is awarded in FY15, as anticipated, there will be a logistical conflict between Fay and the RCCC contractor since both Fay's Contract and the RCCC will require the use of the GOCO concrete batch plant.  It would be impossible for two different contractors to operate the GOCO batch plant at the same time.  The batch plant does not have the storage capacity to accommodate multiple material stockpiles (cement, pozzalons, stone, sand, admixtures, etc.).  It would be impossible to track and administer material supply, material usage, operation, cleaning, maintenance, and environmental controls if multiple contractors shared the operation of the batch plant.   <br>  <br> The proposed contract modification would resolve this conflict in advance by adding multiple options to Fay's contract to produce and delivery up to 55,000 cubic yards of concrete to the RCCC contractor.  The 55,000 cubic yards of concrete is for construction of monoliths M1-M7 and M11-M16, plus a contingency amount in the event the contracts overlap longer than anticipated or the RCCC contractor's construction proceeds faster than anticipated.  Upon completion of Fay's Contract, the RCCC contractor will take over the GOCO batch plant and produce the quantity of concrete needed to complete the RCCC. <br>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the US Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR) has a requirement for research, technical, and scientific administrative support to programs conducted by USACEHR at Fort Detrick, MD. <br> The Contractor may perform searches of the technical literature and may be requested to provide support in document acquisition and translation. The Contractor shall participate in development and preparation of research scopes of work, animal-use and research protocols and standing operating procedures as needed in the planning and execution of research projects. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall perform laboratory procedures, testing and research protocols in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology and toxicology (toxicogenomics), toxicology, biomarkers of exposure and effects, aquatic biology, biomonitoring and remote monitoring of contaminated areas, fate and effects of environmental contaminants, exposure assessment, human and ecological risk assessment and model development, and other related areas. Methods may be of a routine nature or may involve specialized procedures. A part of the research may consist of the development of new procedures or methods. The Contractor shall perform maintenance of laboratory animals and cellular organisms at USACEHR facilities. Specific expertise in maintenance and husbandry of rodent, aquatic and amphibian species maintained by USACEHR is required. <br>  <br> In situations in which the Contractor is required to work on-site, a part of USACEHR laboratory space and office space will be identified for Contractor use. Where practicable, and not otherwise addressed, Contractor staff also shall have equipment and facilities dedicated to their use only. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall prepare, edit and complete technical reports, manuscripts, annual reports and other technical documents, including oral reporting and briefing materials, as required. The Contractor shall review intramural and extramural technical research proposals, reports, manuscripts, and other scientific documents as requested. This may require the ability to generate detailed graphics and to utilize other current audio-visual presentation software and technologies. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) may be required to support specialized taskings. As SME services are required for these taskings, the contractor shall be provided with a PWS that identifies the specific requirements. <br>  <br> USACEHR is developing new and novel approaches to assessing the nature and extent of contamination of the environment. The development and application of mammalian and non-mammalian hazard assessment models coupled with analytical chemistry data provide for an integrated biological assessment of the presence of hazards to both human and ecological receptors. The development and application of this technology is facilitated by an effective review and sharing of the information with DoD program managers, extramural contractors, industry, other government agencies, academic institutions and the public at large. There are many products by which the progress and results of the USACEHR research program may be summarized and disseminated. The Contractor shall provide for all elements of intramural research management, technology transfer and marketing, but the focus is support of ongoing efforts in biomarker discovery, animal husbandry, and development of Tier 2 assays for endocrine disrupting chemicals. <br>  <br> USACEHR conducts research, development, testing and evaluation activities that involve the use of a number of mammalian and non-mammalian aquatic species as animal models. This research requires the establishment, maintenance and renewal of mammalian and aquatic organism cultures, operation of testing facilities for exposure to chemical toxicants under a variety of conditions, to include injection, inhalation, and operation of a water treatment facility to ensure that culture and test waters are of uniform and acceptable quality. All routine activities, including preparation of periodic reports, are performed according to USACEHR standing operating procedures (SOPs). Coordinate and schedule organism colony renewals and husbandry to provide sufficient organisms to meet the needs of researchers. Provide periodic (e.g., monthly) reports on the status of all mammalian and aquatic organisms. Facility operation must meet accreditation requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).  Organisms to be maintained include but are not limited to mice, rats, medaka, bluegill, zebrafish, fathead minnows, Xenopus frogs, killifish, daphnids and algae. Duties include feeding the organisms and maintaining live food sources (e.g., microworms, algae and brine shrimp), tank and glassware cleaning, maintenance and housekeeping in animal rooms, set-up and take-down of tanks, ordering supplies and equipment in a timely fashion to prevent shortages, shipping and receiving organisms and providing proper quarantine procedures, developing new aquaculture procedures as needed, and fabricating simple items such as specialty test chambers. Use of some equipment such as a plate glass cutter or drill for glass tanks or rubber stoppers is required. Monitor operation of well water facilities and notify maintenance staff immediately of malfunctions. Conduct daily, weekly or other periodic water quality sampling and measurement as required, using wet chemical methods or water quality equipment, such as meters, probes and recording devices to measure parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, ammonia, alkalinity and hardness. As needed, construct, operate and maintain the aquatic toxicity testing facility fixtures and equipment, including apparatus such as flow-through proportional diluters, peristaltic pumps, etc. Assist in toxicity test operation and maintenance. Modify tanks or adapt specialized equipment to toxicity testing needs. Clean tanks and equipment to remove chemicals used in testing. Facility maintenance must meet AAALAC requirements. <br>  <br> USACEHR is developing new toxicity test models. In one approach, USACEHR is attempting to identify molecular biomarkers that are indicative of toxic chemical exposure using zebrafish, several mammalian cell culture models and rat models of toxicity. The availability of well-characterized biomarkers in these model organisms will enable the Army to evaluate new chemicals for possible toxic effects and to test potentially contaminated environments for the presence of toxic hazards for humans and other organisms. Both proteomic and genomic technologies are being utilized in this effort. All routine activities, including preparation of periodic reports, are performed according to USACEHR SOPs. Carry out largely independent research projects to identify novel biomarkers of exposure and effect using one or more of the above model systems. Develop new laboratory methods and adapt existing techniques to the equipment and project at hand. Perform sophisticated molecular studies on RNA, DNA and proteins extracted from liver, gill and other tissues of the above model organisms. Maintain notebooks and databases of all experiments and be responsible for data interpretation and statistical analysis. Prepare presentations for laboratory and scientific meetings; prepare manuscripts for presentation of results in scientific journals from experimentation, and assist co-authors in papers containing his/her significant contributions. Access and utilize the scientific literature to establish and modify methods, support protocol preparation and approval, design studies, and prepare manuscripts and presentations. The development of the new toxicity test models involves and using them to conduct exposure experiments that involve genomic and proteomic evaluations in addition to determination of the physiologic effects of the exposures. Protocols are developed for zebrafish, mammalian cell culture models, and rodents. For zebrafish, gene expression analyses are done using Agilent or Affymetrix microarrays; Affymetrix GeneChips are used for all the other model systems. Proteomic analyses make use of a combination of electrophoresis, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Conduct literature searches for test chemicals, evaluate analytical methods for utility in our experiments, evaluate the behavior of the test chemicals under our test conditions, and determine the appropriate designs for chemical replenishment during the exposure experiments. Be responsible for proteomic analyses of samples from exposure experiments. Develop and apply microscopic evaluation methods and other physiologic measurements for evaluation of effects of exposures. Assist with conduct of exposure experiments. Assist with gene expression analyses when needed. <br>  <br> USACEHR has collected data from numerous research protocols that must be prepared for publication in peer reviewed journals. Contractor is requested to provide expertise in the form of a technical writer to assist in the preparation of manuscripts to be submitted for publication. The contractor will have experience in preparing manuscripts and will possess the necessary skill set to understand the collected data (i.e.: comprehension of scientific work performed--see work descriptions above), organize the data in an appropriate format, prepare descriptive narrative in appropriate format, and edit the manuscript. <br>  <br> Key personnel for this requirement is expected to include, but not be limited to: <br>  <br> Animal care and laboratory technician <br> Aquaculture specialist <br> Molecular biologist / biomarker scientist <br> Molecular biologist / transcriptomics scientist <br>  <br> This procurement is a 100% small business set aside for offerors operating under the NAICS code 541712, with a size standard of 500 employees.  <br>  <br> Solicitation number W81XWH-15-R-0027 is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about 30 January 2015 and proposals will be due on or about 02 March 2015.

OFFERORS WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
This acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 36-602-1 and VAAR Part 836.601-1. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate SF-330 technical proposals:

The A-E must demonstrate its and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance and are equal among themselves; Criterion (7) is the least important and will be used as a tie breaker among technically equal firms; and Criterion (8) will exclude a firm from further evaluation. Specific evaluation criteria include:

1.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

2.	Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.

3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

4.	Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.

5.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

6.	Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.

7.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

8.	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
Criterion 1 - Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. (SF-330 Part 1 Section F) - Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence in the performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract with regard to:
? Experience with design of similar types of facilities;
? Experience with multi-phased hospital design and construction programs;
? Experience with construction and renovation phasing in hospitals and other VA facilities;
? Experience in providing post construction award services (shop drawing review, as-built drawing and Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) preparation, construction inspection services, and Operating and Maintenance Manuals).

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project's square footage. All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF-330 Part 1, Section F Item 25 "Firms from Section C Involved in this Project," block (1). Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c). Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF-330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Offerors will be evaluated in terms of the qualifications, competence and experience of the key personnel and technical team proposed to accomplish this work. Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Provide a balanced licensed and or certified workforce in required disciplines.

Submission requirements: Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel. Resumes are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience and indicate proposed role in this contract. Provide professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation. Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF-330Part 1 Section G.

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm's ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm's capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance - Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1 will be given greater weight.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 19, Attn: Andrew Stigen via email at andrew.stigen@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />A major AHRQ priority is producing evidence that will increase the affordability, efficiency and quality of health care. AHRQ seeks to develop and spread evidence to measure and enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery systems. Delivery system reform has created new models of service delivery intended to facilitate the spread of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR). Increasingly, physicians and other providers work in new types of complex arrangements with ownership structures and incentives that are not well understood (Casalino, 2014). In particular, evidence on how to effectively target PCOR-related dissemination efforts to physicians or to delivery systems has been limited (Casalino, 2014). AHRQ seeks to improve the efficiency and value of U.S. health care by understanding how high performing health care systems quickly diffuse PCOR evidence into practice to improve outcomes and reduce costs. AHRQ's goal is to identify, characterize, and classify types of delivery systems and to compare the performance (quality, resource use, cost) of these systems with each other.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The purpose of this requirement is to establish a single Comparative Health System Performance Coordinating Center to facilitate and support activities of the Centers of Excellence to be funded under FOA HS-14-011, Comparative Health System Performance in Accelerating PCOR Dissemination. The Systems Performance Coordinating Center is intended to support the Centers of Excellence on Comparative Health System Performance activities by leveraging expertise, infrastructure, and resources across three Centers of Excellence (CoEs). <br /><br /><strong>Project requirements<br /></strong>The Coordinating Center shall conduct activities such as convening stakeholders and technical experts and facilitating collaboration across CoEs to harmonize methods and measures where possible and to foster cross-CoE collaborations. The Coordinating Center shall serve as the focal point for harmonizing measurement and synthesizing data, research, and evidence from the CoEs on the characteristics of high-performing health systems and practices to accelerate PCOR dissemination to improve health system performance. The Coordinating Center shall also serve as a resource to promote broad dissemination of research on the characteristics of high-performing health systems and practices to accelerate PCOR dissemination to improve health system performance. <br /><br />Key deliverables include:<br />&bull; Development of a Compendium on systems performance. The goal of the Compendium is to link and/or combine data from the CoEs and other procured data to create a cross-project aggregate picture of systems characteristics and outcomes. <br />&bull; Development and dissemination of Products (reports, peer-reviewed articles, briefs) on Systems Performance. The Products shall report data analyses; synthesize research and evidence on delivery system organization and performance; and present statistical findings from grantee research projects to key audiences, including delivery systems, policymakers, researchers, and the public.<br />&bull; Convening of Annual Grantee Workshop on synthesizing research and evidence on systems performance. The Annual Grantee Workshop shall bring together grantees, technical experts, stakeholders, and other invitees to facilitate cross-grantee collaboration, harmonization of measures and synthesis of findings.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated period of performance<br /></strong>Award in FY15 - 1 year base with four 1 year options.<br /><br /><strong>Other important considerations</strong><br />None<br /><br /><strong>Capability statement/information sought<br /></strong>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement to address the following:<br /><br />It is required that the offeror have extensive knowledge of and experience in healthcare delivery systems and their performance.

<DESC>A. Description:	 <br>  <br> This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources.  No further information is available from the Contracts Division.  This synopsis/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br>  <br> B. Objective: <br>  <br> To find a source that is qualified to perform the requirements listed below. This notice is for informational purposes only. <br>  <br>  <br> C. Requirement: <br>  <br> The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) seeks partners to transition a technology based on a wholly new concept for storing information on magnetic disks.  In this technology, instead of using the direction of magnetization of domains, ARL stores information in the form of bits with different magnetic permeability to produce a read only memory (ROM).  Since the magnetic permeability is an intrinsic property, magnetic permeability bits are insensitive to inadvertent exposure to a magnetic field, large E&M pulses, and temperature changes.  Further, they can be unaffected by 10 Mega rad of gamma radiation from Co 60.  This technology has broad applicability as ROM for Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) and for archiving.  It also can be used for Random Access Memory (RAM).   Since the usual mechanisms, such as stray fields, for losing information will not affect our media and we do not know of any other mechanism for losing information, it is expected that information written in this form should have a long retention time.  Information stored in the form of permeability bits has the advantage that one can avoid the cost of temperature and humidity control needed for storing information on magnetic tape.  Further, the access to information will be much faster than it is for magnetic tape.  The bits are originally deposited in a form in which they have a high permeability.  Selected high permeability bits of materials, such as Metglas or bilayers of copper and permalloy, are converted to low permeability bits via a thermal process that can be either heating with a laser or ohmic heating.  The permeability bits are read by using a magnetic sensor to measure how the bits affect a magnetic probe field.    The types of magnetic sensor used to read the bits include magnetic tunnel junctions and spin transfer oscillators.  A read head can be used for ROM in RAID or for archiving.  There must be a sensor at each RAM cell.  We have demonstrated this technology on a micron scale.   <br> We are interested in finding partners that will demonstrate this technology on a nanometer scale and expedite bringing this technology to market.   A potential, direct route for writing nanoscale permeability bits is to use a variant of heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR).  An alternative route is to develop CMOS processing to do heating at each cell.  Possible arrangements for achieving these objectives include collaborations, licensing, or Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA).  Relevant ARL IP on this technology is Provisional patent # 62092994, Read-write non-erasable memory with heat assisted magnetic recording head, US Patents  # 8,824,200, Nonvolative memory cells programable by phase change, 7,233,142 Planer reader of non-erasable magnetic media and local permeability, 6,762,954 Local probe of magnetic properties.     <br> Interested companies or laboratories are preferred but not required to have experience and expertise in one (1) or more of the following areas <br>  Magnetic recording <br>  Device development; and <br>   Development of magnetic material <br> Potential partners must have a significant interest in developing this technology so that they either team with ARL to demonstrate the technology, provide funds to demonstrate the technology, license the technology, or enter into a CRADA.  CRADAs provide the potential for significant competitive advantages for our partners, including potential exclusive licenses to ARL technologies. <br>  <br> D. Responses: <br>  <br> All interested parties should notify this office in writing, mail, fax, or e-mail within the posted date.  Responses shall include:  <br>  <br> (1) 	To what extent each of the specifications can be met. Include your type of business (i.e. commercial, academia) and whether your organization is large or small based on the 1,000 employee size standard that accompanies NAICS code 334613.  <br>  <br> (2) Past experience/ performance through the description of completed projects. <br>  <br> Responses to this sources sought synopsis are due no later than 11:59 pm eastern standard time on 01 March 2015. Submissions should be emailed to Hilton A. Thompson, Hilton.a.thompson.civ@mail.mil. Faxed submissions can be sent to (301)394-2889.  Mailed submissions can be sent to the address in block 7, ATTN: Hilton A. Thompson.   <br>  <br> Questions concerning this sources sought synopsis may be directed to Hilton A. Thompson at Hilton.a.thompson.civ@mail.mil or (301)394-2889.  Please be advised that .zip and .exe files cannot be accepted.  <br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The BEP is committed to maintaining certification of its Environmental Management System (EMS) and Quality Management System (QMS).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Both facilities maintain separate registrations to ISO14001:2004 through TUV:SUD America.&nbsp; The DCF completed a full EMS reassessment in April 2013; WCF completed a full EMS reassessment in September of 2012.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Both facilities have wastewater pre-treatment plants that are permitted by a local POTW.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contracting Office Address: </span></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions,
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction: </span></strong>This is a <strong>Small Business Sources Sought </strong>notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background: </span></strong>Small molecules can have a multitude of activities and it is often difficult to understand which target of a small molecule is responsible for an established outcome.  For instance, the small molecule nilotinib is stated to be a BCR-Abl inhibitor.  However, its activity versus other kinase targets including cKit are the reason this drug has clinical activity versus non-BCR-Abl expressing cancers like GIST.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is often difficult to unambiguously define the contributing versus non-contributing pharmacological actions of small molecules (kinase inhibitors, in particular, are difficult to understand).  Recently, a method that utilized a regularized regression mathematical model that relies upon kinase expression data and a detailed knowledge of each small molecules polypharmacology within the kinome to deconvolute the targets of interest from the &lsquo;passenger' targets.</p>
<p>In order to fully apply this method reliable activity data needs to be collected for a collection of known kinase inhibitors.  Several reports have been published demonstrating that these datasets can be generated and in this procurement we aim to establish a non-redundant set of activities for 40 additional kinase inhibitors.  Concomitantly we will be defining unambiguous phenotypes for this collection in several biologically defined assay systems.  Once agents are established that have activity and the key targets are defined the regularized model will be applied to define the contributing versus the non-contributing targets..</p>
<p><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives: </span></strong></strong>This order provides a full kinome profile for 40 established small molecule kinase inhibitors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project requirements: <br /></strong></span>The contractor shall provide the selectivity data for the 40 kinase inhibitor collection versus a minimum of 359 wild-type kinases using standard methods (for instance, the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP into an established peptide or protein substrate).  A minimum of a 10-dose complete response curve should be utilized to establish an unambiguous IC50 value for each agent versus each kinase. <br /> <br />The contractor shall provide a full kinome profile of the 10-dose IC50 values established for 40 kinase inhibitors versus 359 wild-type kinases utilizing standard and validated assays.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance: </span></strong>four (4) weeks after receipt of order.</p>

<DESC>(1) Notice of intent to extend services. This action will result in a modification to the current contract, FA2550-08-C-8011, Network and Space Operations and Maintenance (NSOM), with Harris IT Services Corporation, 2235 Monroe St, Herndon, VA, 20171-2824, for a period of one year. The period of this extension is contemplated to be from 30 Sep 2015 through 29 Sep 2016.
<p>(2) Harris IT Services is considered to be the only responsible offeror for extension of the services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if a new offeror were to be selected in the time remaining before the end of the current NSOM Option.</p>
<p>(3) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.207(c)(16), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>(4) The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract extension, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to: Stephen Cooper, Contracting Officer, at stephen.cooper.1@us.af.mil and Camille Watley, Contracting Officer, at camille.watley.2@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>(5) The 50th Contracting Squadron, 210 Falcon Parkway Suite 2116, Schriever AFB, plans to award a sole source contract to Harris IT Services Corporation for continued services currently provided under contract FA255-08-C-8011, Network and Space Operations and Maintenance (NSOM), which was awarded competitively 11 Jan 2008 and which included a six month base contract period (1 Apr 2008 - 30 Sep 2008) and six priced Options of one year each. Additional priced Options were added to the NSOM contract to allow the Government to order continued performance from 30 Sep 2014 through 29 Sep 2015; the NSOM contract is currently in an Option which ends 30 Mar 2015 and the Government contemplates the exercise of the remaining Options for continued performance through 29 Sep 2015. The NSOM contract is not being competed as a single follow-on contract; instead, current NSOM contract requirements will be performed under multiple new or existing contracts aligned with mission systems or mission requirements (some NSOM contract requirements have already moved to another contract and additional NSOM contract requirements will move to another contract at the end of Jan 2015). The 50th Contracting Squadron anticipates that additional time will be required for another Air Force activity(ies) to complete the realignment of current NSOM requirements to another contract vehicle(s). The 50th Contracting Squadron contemplates the negotiation of an additional one-year Option which will be exercised to provide continuity of current NSOM contract services while the acquisition action(s) is(are) completed for the contract(s) which will provide the services in the future. Therefore, this notice is for a total period of one year.</p>
<p>(6) Services provided under the NSOM contract, some or all of which may be included in an extension of the contract, include operations, maintenance, logistics support, training and related support for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) at locations around the world; along with maintenance, logistics support, training and related support for one Global Positioning System (GPS) facility located at Hawaii Tracking Station; orbital analyst, technical advisory and software support services at Schriever AFB, Colorado; information assurance and safety services at Schriever AFB, Colorado and other 50 SW locations; and operation, maintenance and logistics support services for military satellite communications terminals at Schriever AFB, Colorado, New Boston AFS, New Hampshire and Vandenberg AFB, California.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with EOM Offshore LLC for four (4) 50-foot Ethernet-capable hoses/cables for mooring buoys for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI.
<p><br />A Special Notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on December 31, 2014 and closed on January 12, 2015. No responses were received.</p>
<p>The hoses/cables shall have the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall have eight #22 gauge conductive wires for use with data transfer and power transfer on each end of the cable<br />&bull; Shall be able to stretch 2.5 times its length<br />&bull; Shall have four unshielded twisted pairs for Ethernet speed capability<br />&bull; Shall have mechanical flanges to mate the top and bottom end of the mooring cable to allow for connection to surface buoy and bottom weight/instrument package<br />&bull; Shall be in 50 foot length<br />&bull; Shall have four #24AWG unshielded twist pairs<br />&bull; Shall be shipped in secure prefabricated wooden or plastic container</p>
<p>This is a 50-foot stretch hose with two flange adapters. This is a bungee-like cord with electrical wires coiled inside and designed to moor meteorological buoys and allow information and power to be transferred from the top of the buoy to instruments down below. Cables shall be attached to an internally designed meteorological buoy (1.4 meters in size), connecting a conductivity, temperature and depth instrument and video feed, along with acoustic sensors and fish finders, providing the ability to monitor below and have flexibility with the data gathered. This method is much safer than the previous chain mooring methods, which put the scientist in harm's way dealing with rapidly descending chain.</p>
<p>The reinforced rubber stretch hose was developed for mooring systems that require a stable platform for sensors or acoustics. It can stretch to two and a half times its original length and serves as a highly effective and robust mechanical isolator between the surface buoy and the quiet lower mooring section.</p>
<p>The cable shall have eight -#22 gage conductive wires for use with data transfer and power transfer and four #24 unshielded twisted pairs for Ethernet speed capability. These specifications are due to having two separate cable types, Ethernet (CAT 5) and copper (data and power). This is not a common design or demand.</p>
<p>The hose construction makes use of elastomeric-synthetic composite technology for elasticity and strength and also has eight number 22AWG conductors and four 24AWG twisted pairs built into it to allow signals and power to be transmitted along its length. All mooring connections are bolted flanges to minimize other sources of mechanical noise and to enable a modular approach to mooring design.</p>
<p>A 50-foot cable is required in order to reach 125-foot depths within the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>At this time there are no other known vendors that supply this type of mooring. EOM Offshore is a company spawned from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and have developed this method of mooring buoys/instrumentation and coupling them to seabed instrumentation.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the procurement and installation of a Closed Circuit Television and Access Control System (CCTV-ACS) and a Fire Alarm and Mass Notification System (FA-MNS) that will be a part of the NAMRU-6 Laboratory construction project. The government is seeking to specify the use of two (2) manufacturers, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),  for the two (2) categories of electronic systems listed below in order to insure compatibility among  Life, Health, Safety and Antiterrorism, Force Protection and Operational Security systems.  The use of different incompatible electronics in systems which involve Life, Health, Safety, OPSEC and AT/FP could lead to the death or injury of US and Host Nation personnel occupying the Naval Medical Research Site or compromise to critical US military medical research.  The failure of the ACS in an area where terrorist groups target US personnel and interests could result in the death or injury of US personnel and damage or destruction to US property and disruption to vital medical research. If these items were to be procured by a separate action, this would occur after Beneficial Occupancy Date (BOD).  Therefore, the labs would not be fully functional until the FA & MNS and ACS systems could be brought on line and this would result in unacceptable delays in research vital to national security and to general world health.   Therefore, it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to specify the following commercial systems for use in the NAMRU-6 Construction project: <br>  <br> a.	 Fire Alarm and Mass Notification System (FA & MNS):  Siemens-$30,000.00 (estimated) <br>  <br>      1.	Fire alarm & mass notification system is an electronic system to detect fire and alert building occupants thru visual and audio appliances when smoke or fire is present. <br>  <br>      2.	The existing Fire Alarm & Mass Notification system (FA &MNS) in NAMRU - 6 campus is made by Siemens. Any new FA & MNS system will have to be by Siemens so NAMRU 6 can maintain their existing FA & MNS network.

<a href="mailto:michael.c.mctague@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the procurement and installation of a Closed Circuit Television and Access Control System (CCTV-ACS) and a Fire Alarm and Mass Notification System (FA-MNS) that will be a part of the NAMRU-6 Laboratory construction project. The government is seeking to specify the use of two (2) manufacturers, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),  for the two (2) categories of electronic systems listed below in order to insure compatibility among  Life, Health, Safety and Antiterrorism, Force Protection and Operational Security systems.  The use of different incompatible electronics in systems which involve Life, Health, Safety, OPSEC and AT/FP could lead to the death or injury of US and Host Nation personnel occupying the Naval Medical Research Site or compromise to critical US military medical research.  The failure of the ACS in an area where terrorist groups target US personnel and interests could result in the death or injury of US personnel and damage or destruction to US property and disruption to vital medical research. If these items were to be procured by a separate action, this would occur after Beneficial Occupancy Date (BOD).  Therefore, the labs would not be fully functional until the FA & MNS and ACS systems could be brought on line and this would result in unacceptable delays in research vital to national security and to general world health.   Therefore, it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to specify the following commercial systems for use in the NAMRU-6 Construction project: <br>  <br> a.	 Fire Alarm and Mass Notification System (FA & MNS):  Siemens-$30,000.00 (estimated) <br>  <br> 1.	Fire alarm & mass notification system is an electronic system to detect fire and alert building occupants thru visual and audio appliances when smoke or fire is present. <br>  <br> 2.	The existing Fire Alarm & Mass Notification system (FA &MNS) in NAMRU - 6 campus is made by Siemens. Any new FA & MNS system will have to be by Siemens so NAMRU 6 can maintain their existing FA & MNS network. New Siemens FA&MN systems will be specified (Sole-Source) to maintain the existing FA & MNS network. <br>  <br>  <br> b.	Closed Circuit Television and Access Control System (CCTV-ACS):  Lenel-$25,000.00 (Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection and Operational Security systems (AT/FP & OPSEC)).  <br>  <br> 1.	CCTV system is a closed-circuit television system also known as video surveillance. CCTV is used to monitor and record activities around NAMRU-6. The CCTV system includes cameras & a network video recorder. Access Control System (ACS) system is an electronic system to limit access to buildings on NAMRU-6 to authorized personnel only. <br>  <br> 2.	The existing CCTV & Access control System (ACS) in NAMRU - 6 campus is made by Lenel. Any new CCTV & Access control System (ACS) system must be made by the same manufacturer if NAMRU 6 maintains the existing CCTV & ACS network. <br>  <br>  <br> It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract will be awarded.

Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.

<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages).</p>

Certification shall be IAW Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

Proposals will be evaluated IAW FAR 15.101-2.  The award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors.  All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br>  <br> (a)  FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors: <br>  <br> Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability -   This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence the Offeror is a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, and provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort. <br>  <br> Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.  <br> This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates their ability to provide local exchange services to the Government installation as required by the Statement of Work, and provides a site specific diagram of the network connectivity to the Government installation that illustrates the Offeror's ability provide the services in the Statement of Work.    <br>  <br> (b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.  The total evaluated price of all CLINs for the base year and all option years on the Pricing Schedule will be evaluated.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis for the purpose of measuring the Offeror's understanding of the contract requirements.  The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br>  <br>  (c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE.  The government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:   Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that  the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.   Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can reasonably be assigned shall be determined to have unknown past performance and considered  quote mark acceptable quote mark .  <br>  <br>  (End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2) <br>  <br> (x)  Offerors are encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the System for Award Management website located at https://sam.gov/.

It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>The following insurance is required as a minimum; (a) Legally Required Insurance: Where certain laws apply such as State laws governing workman?s compensation and employer?s liability coverage, etc., the contractor, prior to commencement of work, shall furnish the Contracting Officer a written statement that such laws have been complied with and that compliance will continue throughout the period of contract performance. Minimum coverage of $100,000 is required. (b) Comprehensive General Liability & Automobile Liability: Each Person Per Property Occurrence Damage Comprehensive General Liability None $500,000.00 Automobile Liability $200,000.00 $500,000.00 <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to afford the parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations.

(5) be used in administration or supervision of military procurement activities. (c) Employee Relationship: (1) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather the contractor?s employees will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor. (2) Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation.

<DESC>16' CUSTOM ELECTROFISHING BOAT SETUP

The US Fish & Wildlife Service intends to award a sole source contract to Midwest Lake Management, Inc., based on FAR 6.302.1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide a 16 foot electrofishing boat, trailer, MLES Infinity Control Box and MLES Integrated Plug and Go System. The MLES Infinity control box allows for more accurate output and adjustments to the volts, amps and wattage being placed in the water to shock fish.  Accurate output reduces unnecessary injury or harm to fish, and increases efficiency and effectiveness in sampling, along with increased crew safety while operating the boat.  The vendor is the only manufacturer of the MLES Infinity Control Box.  In order to remain consistent with past and future fishery data collection and to allow for accurate data comparisons, the MLES Infinity Control Box is required.  The exact specifications for the items are required in order to be interchangeable with the electrofishing boats currently in service.  This boat and required equipment is required in order to monitor and restore fish populations, meet contractual obligations, and to ensure crew member safety.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>

Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL.

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br /> CAR 1352.209-73 Compliance with the laws.<br /> Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br /> CAR 1352.209-74 Organizational conflict of interest.<br /> (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b)Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter<br /> collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime<br /> contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting<br /> Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br /> <br /> (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:04" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:03" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:04" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:04" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:04" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2015-01-04T21:04" cite="mailto:Mark%20Langstein"> </ins></span>Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br /> CAR 1352.246-70 Place of acceptance<br /> &nbsp;Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>(13) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(14) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award.

Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(15) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

Proposals will be evaluated IAW FAR 15.101-2.  The award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors.  All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:  <br>    <br>  (a)  FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability -   This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence the Offeror is a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, and provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.   <br>  This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates their ability to provide local exchange services to the Government installation as required by the Statement of Work, and provides a site specific diagram of the network connectivity to the Government installation that illustrates the Offeror's ability provide the services in the Statement of Work.     <br>    <br>  (b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.  The total evaluated price of all CLINs for the base year and all option years on the Pricing Schedule will be evaluated.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis for the purpose of measuring the Offeror's understanding of the contract requirements.  The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.  <br>    <br>   (c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE.  The government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:   Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that  the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.   Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can reasonably be assigned shall be determined to have unknown past performance and considered  quote mark acceptable quote mark .   <br>    <br>   (End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)  <br>    <br>  (x)  Offerors are encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the System for Award Management website located at https://sam.gov/.

The award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br>  <br> (1) Factor 1, Technical.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:  <br>  <br> (i) Subfactor 1, Provider Capability.   This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence the Offeror is a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, and provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort. <br>  <br> (ii)  Subfactor 2, Local Communications Services.  This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates their ability to provide local exchange services to the Government installation as required by the Statement of Work, and provides a site specific diagram of the network connectivity to the Government installation that illustrates the Offeror's ability provide the services in the Statement of Work.  <br>  <br> (2)  Factor 2, Price.   The total evaluated price of all CLINs for the base year and all option years on the Pricing Schedule will be evaluated. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis for the purpose of measuring the Offeror's understanding of the contract requirements. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br>  <br> (3)   Factor 3, Past Performance.  The government will employ several approaches including reviewing contract references provided by the Offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: Acceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the Offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can reasonably be assigned shall be determined to have unknown past performance and considered  quote mark acceptable quote mark .  <br>  <br> End of 52.212-2 Addendum  <br>  <br> (x) Offerors are encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the System for Award Management website located at URL https://sam.gov/ .

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerors specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77 and 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)). (b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>(3) As used in this clause, records include books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and regardless of form. This does not require the Contractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a provision of law. (e)(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of the clauses in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this clause, the Contractor is not required to flow down any FAR clause, other than those in this paragraph (e)(1) of this paragraph in a subcontract for commercial items. Unless otherwise indicated below, the extent of the flow down shall be as required by the clause- (i) 52.203-13, Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (APR 2010) (41 U.S.C. 3509). <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by refere -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>

<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Firm Fixed-Price task orders are preferred although task orders may be either Firm Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, or Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system to support quantum Hall research in the Physical Measurement Laboratory. The system will be situated within the Fundamental Electrical Measurements Group (FEM) as a resource accessible to NIST researchers and to outside users via collaboration to measure a wide range of physical properties of quantum Hall devices. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications further developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order for a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Measuring the properties of new quantum Hall devices is a critical part of the FEM mission. A versatile, sensitive, and easy to use cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system is required to characterize such new devices. To fulfill this requirement, NIST plans to purchase a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator system that has the capability to provide automated measurements of magneto-transport over a range of low temperatures and large magnetic fields. The measurement system shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>GENERAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1. Cryogen-free: The Government requires a system in which liquid helium is not needed. A system that requires the use of liquid helium will not be accepted. A system requiring liquid nitrogen is acceptable. The minimum acceptable period of time between liquid nitrogen replenishment is 7 days;</p>
<p>2. Cooling Power: Minimum cooling power 400 &micro;W at 0.1 K.</p>
<p><br />3. Dilution refrigerator operational with and without magnet.</p>
<p>4. Cool-down and warm-up times without magnet (between room temperature and base): The maximum acceptable time is 30 hours for both.</p>
<p>5. Cool-down and warm-up times with magnet (between room temperature and base): The maximum acceptable time is 50 hours for both.</p>
<p>6. Base temperature: The maximum acceptable temperature is 12 mK with magnet at full field and all leads connected to mixing chamber (see below)</p>
<p>7. Sample space and Magnet: A sample space within a minimum &plusmn;14 Tesla superconducting magnet will be provided. As part of the requirement of a cryogen-free system, the superconducting magnet must be cryogen-free. The sample space must have a minimum diameter of 40 mm and a maximum acceptable magnetic field inhomogeneity of 0.1% within a 10 mm diameter spherical volume.</p>
<p>COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:<br />8. Low-frequency leads:</p>
<p>a. Three shielded cables, each containing 12 low ohmic twisted pairs (total of 72 leads, 24 leads in each shield) running between the top plate and the mixing chamber, shall be provided. All leads material shall be copper from the top plate to the plate near 4 K and superconducting from the plate near 4 K to the mixing chamber. Total resistance for each lead from the top plate to the mixing chamber with system at base temperature shall be less than 1 ohm. The three cables will have breakouts with micro connectors at the plate near 4 K and the still with electrostatic shields for each cable electrically continuous from room temperature down to the mixing chamber.</p>
<p>b. Wiring for one extra thermometer. Thermally-anchored wiring for a standard commercial four-lead ruthenium oxide thermometer shall be provided, satisfying the following:<br />i. The wiring shall terminate below the mixing chamber.<br />ii. If a single commercial temperature controller to read other thermometers in various locations is used, a separate channel in this temperature controller shall be provided that shall be connected to the four-lead wiring provided for our use.</p>
<p>9. System Size: The Government requires a system that is as short (distance between top plate and floor) as possible. This requirement is important given that, if possible, operation without the need of personnel climbing on ladders is advantageous. The maximum acceptable distance is 3 m.</p>
<p>10. Ease of Use: The Government requires a system which can be operated from open to closed to base temperature to room temperature to open by only one person (as opposed to requiring two or more people to operate some or all of the cycle).</p>
<p>11. Sound isolation box: The government wishes to reduce the noise coming from the pulse tube refrigerator (PTR) through the top plate of the cryostat. For this reason, the contractor shall provide panels with sound-deadening acoustical foam on all six sides surrounding the top plate (above, below, and all four sides).</p>
<p>12. Pulse Tube Refrigerator Compressor Location: A system in which the compressor for the pulse tube refrigerator can be located in a separate room shall be provided. The minimum acceptable distance between the compressor and the system is 10 m.</p>
<p>13. Vibration: The maximum acceptable amplitude of vibrations is 10 &micro;m at the mixing chamber plate.</p>
<p>14. System Mechanical Support: A standard floor-based support system shall be provided. To avoid possible additional electrical noise in the system, the top plate and metal pieces inside the cryostat will be electrically isolated from the support system.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at the Mammoth Cave Hotel within Mammoth Cave National Park. The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined the existing Concessioner is NOT a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded.<br /><br />As an attraction, Mammoth Cave predates all national parks in the United States: historic records report that people first started visiting the cave in 1816, and it became internationally known by the mid-1800s. Congress authorized Mammoth Cave National Park on May 25, 1926. The purpose of Mammoth Cave National Park is to preserve the cave system, including Mammoth Cave, the scenic river valleys of the Green and Nolin rivers, and a section of south central Kentucky for recreational use, particularly the hilly country north of Green River. The Park contains the longest recorded cave system in the world with more than 400 miles explored and mapped. The Park was designated a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and became the core area of an International Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990. <br /><br />The Concession Business Opportunity is comprised of Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services: <br />The Concessioner will operate the Mammoth Cave Hotel which includes the Sunset Terrace Lodge, the Historic Cottages, and the Woodland Cottages, a full service dining room and a new fast casual facility, a gift shop located in the Mammoth Cave Hotel offering merchandise and Kentucky-made crafts. Additionally, the Concessioner will operate the Camper Store at the Service Center Complex, which provides grocery, camping supplies, and convenience items. The Concessioner also currently operates eight buses to transport approximately 42 percent of cave tour visitors from the visitor center to various cave entrances. Other required services include vending, kennels, and public shower/laundry services within its facilities. Gross revenues from 2010-2012 have been between $3,814,646 and $3,990,194.
<p>A site visit will be held on February 4, 2015 at Mammoth Cave National Park.

<a href="mailto:johannes.cardenas@navy.mil">johannes.cardenas@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government. 

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of P-520 Steam Plant Decentralization at Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD), San Diego, California. 

This project involves the design and construction for decentralizing the production of steam-based space heating, domestic hot water heating, and process heating.
 Decentralization shall be accomplished by installing individual boilers at each building and responding to various facility improvements associated with each building. For each building, high efficiency natural gas water boilers, electric heaters, or similar heating system retrofits shall replace the existing steam heating system. High efficiency natural gas-fired water heaters, electric water heaters, or similar domestic water heating retrofits shall be provided for heating domestic hot water (DHW). A single heating plant with short sections of underground piping shall serve each building in the group where groups of buildings are clustered together or space restrictions prevent separate systems for each building.

The project includes renovations of all affected building interiors where the existing heating systems are renovated within the occupied portions of existing buildings.
 Renovations include ceiling, wall, and roofing repairs, as well as furring to accommodate mechanical piping and electrical renovations. Mechanical utility work includes upgrading and expanding the natural gas laterals or valve box or vault for the underground natural gas piping system to provide the required gas service to the new gas-fired system retrofits and/or providing new gas lateral for building where there are no existing gas service. Each building shall service new gas loads as well as existing loads for building with existing gas service. Gas service to each facility shall include service meters with pulse output capable of remote reading. Electrical utility work includes modification of existing underground electrical to accommodate the decentralized steam system retrofits.
 Demolish the existing aboveground steam distribution system and disconnect from the existing central cogeneration steam plant to accomplish full decentralization of the steam system. Demolish existing steam tunnels, trenches, and manholes. Repair paving, parking aprons, and other surfaces where tunnels, trenches, and manholes are removed.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is $15 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $25,000,000 and $35,000,000. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 â€“ Technical Approach, Factor 2 â€“ Experience, Factor 3 â€“ Past Performance, Factor 4 â€“ Safety; Phase 2: Factor 5 â€“ Technical Solution, Factor 6 â€“ Small Business Utilization, Factor 7 â€“ Price.
 

The Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal. A maximum of five Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting. 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil by 30 January 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORâ€™S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.
 

Prospective Offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. 

A pre-proposal conference for Phase One will not be held. A pre-proposal presentation and document with frequently asked questions will be posted along with the solicitation on www.neco.navy.mil for your review.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS HEREBY CANCELLED AND WILL BE REPLACED WITH AN RFQ.<br /><br />The Program Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MarcParc, Inc. for garage parking for OCIO/OEAD employees in the Silver Spring Centre. This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />&nbsp;
<p>MarcPark System's garage located in the Silver Spring Centre affords OEAD employees security and accessibility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by virtue of its containment within the Silver Spring Centre, and the electronic security in place after hours.</p>
<p>OEAD employees in this location frequently work outside the standard workday during the performance of their regular duties, processing HR and financial actions as well as procurement actions - all transactions that are run at biweekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual intervals. Additionally, these OEAD employees are often required to implement system changes outside the standard workday which must also be performed after hours in order to service the HHS user community. It is imperative that the OEAD employees have a secure place for parking and building access when working outside standard workday hours.</p>
<p>MarcPark System's garage located in the Silver Spring Centre is the only known source able to satisfy this requirement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. However, any firm believing itself capable of providing these services may submit technical documentation to establish their capability. Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer by January 20, 2015 before 10AM ET.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will&nbsp;be considered solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. Documentation should be submitted electronically to Wendy Cruz at wendy.cruz@psc.hhs.gov. Telephone responses will not be considered.</p>

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  Concrete  <br>  Batch Plant  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to initiate a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) negotiated modification to add multiple options for concrete production and delivery to Contract W911WN-14-C-0003 (the Contract) awarded to Joseph B. Fay Company (Fay), 100 Sky Lane, Tarentum, PA  15084-2807.  The Contract is for the construction of Monoliths M-22 to M-27, Charleroi Locks and Dam River Chamber.   <br>    <br>  The proposed contract modification will add multiple options to the Contract to produce and deliver up to 55,000 cubic yards (cy) of concrete at a Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) batch plant.  Under its Contract, Fay is required to operate the GOCO batch plant to produce approximately 28,000 cubic yards of concrete and build six middle wall concrete monoliths (M22-M27). The batch plant is the only source for concrete production and delivery for the Charleroi Locks and Dam project.  If the Charleroi River Chamber Completion Contract (RCCC) is awarded in FY15, as anticipated, there will likely be a logistical conflict between Fay and the RCCC contractor since both Fay's Contract and the RCCC will require the use of the GOCO concrete batch plant.  It would be impossible for two different contractors to operate the GOCO batch plant at the same time.  The batch plant does not have the storage capacity to accommodate multiple material stockpiles (cement, pozzalons, stone, sand, admixtures, etc.).  It would be impossible to track and administer material supply, material usage, operation, cleaning, maintenance, and environmental controls if multiple contractors shared the operation of the batch plant.    <br>    <br>  The proposed contract modification would resolve this conflict in advance by adding multiple options to Fay's contract to produce and delivery up to 55,000 cubic yards of concrete to the RCCC contractor.  The 55,000 cubic yards of concrete is for construction of monoliths M1-M7 and M11-M16, plus a contingency amount in the event the contracts overlap longer than anticipated or the RCCC contractor's construction proceeds faster than anticipated.  Upon completion of Fay's Contract, the RCCC contractor will take over the GOCO batch plant and produce the quantity of concrete needed to complete the RCCC.  <br>

This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation has been scheduled to be released via FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov) to the vendor community on or about 31 January 2015, which will be available for proposal responses for a period of 30 days.  Specifications of this requirement shall be provided in the solicitation under Solicitation Number W81XWH-15-R-0014.    <br>      <br>   This pre-solicitation notice follows a Request for Information (RFI) which was issued on 10 May 2013 through FedBizOps under RFI number W81XWH-13-R-FIID.   <br>      <br>   The solicitation will be set-aside for small business concerns, and will allow for full and open competition amongst all qualifying small business participants.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711 and the size standard is 500 employees.    <br>      <br>   Requirement Description:   <br>      <br>   This requirement provides for the development of multiple immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) for the rapid diagnosis/ detection of infectious diseases (IDs), and biological warfare agent (BWA)-related IDs of military significance.  ICT's developed under this requirement will support the mission of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and subordinate commands of the USAMRMC to develop and manage medical materiel to protect, and sustain the Warfighter on point for the Nation.     <br>      <br>   This requirement will be set-aside for small business participation only, and the contract award will utilize a single-award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle.  The award recipient shall develop/deliver ICTs issued in the form of individual task orders (TOs) under the ID/IQ contract. It is anticipated that the contractor will potentially develop the following ICTs:   <br>   a.

These services shall be provided at a standard which enables the USAMMDA, and the USAMRMC to achieve the cost, schedule, and performance goals of its ICT development activities to the level of quality necessary to comply with programmatic requirements, DoD and Army regulations, ISO standards, and FDA regulations (to include both human subject protection and animal care and use regulations); including submissions to federal regulatory agencies.  Specific task requirements will be further defined through individual performance work statements (PWS) on a task order basis.  The award recipient must have manufacturing facilities in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and will be the sponsor for the 510(k) of each ICT assay for the FDA.   <br>   Background:   <br>      <br>   The USAMRMC is one of the Department of Defense's (DoD) advanced development organizations for medical products designed to protect and preserve the lives of military service members.  The USAMRMC develops new drugs, vaccines, devices, and medical support equipment that enhances readiness to ensure the provision of the highest quality medical and preventative care to the DoD, and maximize survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.     <br>      <br>   Period of Performance:    <br>      <br>   The period of performance (POP) for the base ID/IQ contract will be five years in duration, with one 12 month base period, accompanied by 4 twelve month option periods.  Each TO issued under the ID/IQ contract for this requirement will have the potential to have a 4 year POP, depending on the advancement/development of the assays required.   <br>      <br>   Response:    <br>      <br>   This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this pre-solicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this pre-solicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.

<AWARDEE>ATCA  1101 KING ST 300 ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2963
<DESC>I recommend that the NASA Shared Services Center negotiate with the Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) only for calendar year 2015 (period of January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015): 100 copies of Air Traffic Control Quarterly publications and ATCA yearly membership for 26 NASA employees.  The cost of the quarterly publication is $XXXXXXX and the cost of the membership fees is $XXXXXXX, for a total estimated cost of $XXXXX.  The estimated period of performance is January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The Air Traffic Control Quarterly is a quarterly journal of peer-reviewed and selected technical articles on air traffic control subjects, authored by noted Air Traffic Control (ATC) experts from leading research and academic organizations around the world. This publication includes quantitative studies, results of original research, reports on innovative applications of ATC and related technologies, and analyses of ATC operations. Among subjects addressed are ATC operations, automation, operations research, communications, navigation, surveillance, human factors, free flight, wake vortex, aviation weather, and air traffic management. This publication is designed to serve as a resource for ATC engineers, scientists, and research and operations specialists. Membership in ATCA offers many benefits, such as:  participating in ATCAs International Technical Conference and Exhibits, which allow a forum for discussion of key issues that affect the future of the Global ATCA System in venues outside of the US; participating in ATCAs Annual Conference and Exposition, which provides each member with the opportunity to express views to ATCAs officers and Board; and participating in national/international symposia addressing various aviation-related subjects.  Membership in ATCA also enables members to receive the ATCA Bulletin, ATCAs monthly newsletter which contains reports on national/international ATC developments of interest and timely information on ATCAs activities and news affecting the associations membership.  Membership also includes the ATCA Journal of Air Traffic Control which contains scholarly articles and news reports of significant advances, developments and techniques of interest in the field of air traffic control.  An additional benefit is the products of ATCA's coordination/collaboration with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency regarding export of U.S. aviation-related products to satisfy international civil aviation requirements. This recommendation is made pursuant to Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 						 1. This procurement is to purchase membership in ATCA for 26 NASA employees and to obtain 100 copies of a quarterly publication provided only by ATCA that supports the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates (ARMDs) program and project research efforts. 2. These publications, as well as the memberships, are necessary for ARMD researchers to remain current on technical activities within the air traffic control arena.  3. The membership into ATCA offers opportunities to interact with U.S. and worldwide air traffic control personnel and exchange experience and expertise in the air traffic control field and experience in conducting studies and analyses focusing on global ATC system developments. 4. The ATCA provides member pricing on these publications which are not available from any other known source.  Non-member pricing is higher.	The NASA membership renewal will allow this discounted price on the publication through December 31, 2015.  Publications are priced $XX per copy. Pricing information is available at the following website:    http://www.atca.org/Air-Traffic-Control-Quarterly-Subscriptions-and-Reprints 5. The ATCA offers discounted pricing to Government and Military Organizations for up to 7 members at a rate of $XX, and additional memberships at a rate of $XX each. Pricing information is available at the following website:  http://www.atca.org/index.asp?bid=109 6. Pursuant to FAR 5.101(a) (1), the proposed contract action will not be published on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and Governmentwide Point of Entry.

506-15-2-041-0487	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$32,500.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: 
This is a request for a firm fixed price purchase order to Edwards Lifesciences (1 Edwards Way, Irvine, CA 92614) to purchase one (1) transcatheter heart valve, Saipen XT, transfermeral and direct aortic, 29mm size



3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
Edwards Lifesciences is the only vendor that assists customers with the training process, on-site support, and hands on experience that is required when starting this process as new users of the transcatheter heart valves.  This is done at no cost to the VA.  Edwards has already provided five days of onsite training and support for the nursing and technical staff in the Cath Lab.  They will continue to be on-site in order to assist the staff through the first 20 procedures.  
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic are the only two manufacturers that have been iFDA approved to provide of the heart valves needed.  Medtronic does not offer any of the on-site training that Edwards will be providing at no cost to the VA.  Medtronic's sales model is to sell their transcatheter heart valves to clinics already experienced in this procedure.  The Cath Lab has so many inexperienced staff members, so they can only use the Edwards Saipen XT heart valves as Edwards provides the training and support.  


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A market study was previously completed, both GSA and open market, and it was found that there are only two FDA approved manufacturers of the transcatheter heart valves, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic.  An intent to sole source was published to FBO, with negative responses.  Further, recent contract (506A50078) for identical heart valves was completed as a sole source requirement, and the price of the valve needed is identical to the price of the heart valve on this order.

<DESC>On December 30, 2014 the Department of Justice (DOJ)&nbsp;Procurement Services Staff (PSS) executed a contract modification to extend contractor support for a period of twelve (12) months. The Department intends to complete the competitive procurement for these services during the period of extension. The extension will ensure continuity of mission critical services for the Department until a new contract can be awarded that includes an adequate transition period should the new contract be awarded to a vendor other than the incumbent. It is anticipated that the award of a new contract for Consulting Services in support of Microsoft products will be awarded prior to December 31, 2015.
