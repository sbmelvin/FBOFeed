<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. MDA410-02-R-0002 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP) and this announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no further written solicitation will be issued.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-01.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 6117110 and the Business Size Standard of $5.0 M applies to this procurement.  Services required: Contractor shall plan, execute, and provide follow-up for the Department of Defense (DoD) Roundtable: "Education Issues of the Mobile Military Child." in Seattle, Washington, 26 and 27 February 2002 .  The Educational Opportunities Directorate of the Department of Defense (Ed Op) is tasked with improving the educational transition of children of our mobile military families.  The roundtable format has been selected as a means of canvassing areas of the country that are highly-impacted by military presence to: 1) surface educational transition issues, 2) discuss possible solutions to transition issues, 3) promote partnerships between military installations and surrounding school districts.   Families of active duty military personnel include approximately 760,000 school-aged children. DoD operates schools overseas and at a limited number of stateside locations.  These schools serve about 110,000 students leaving 650,000 to be educated outside DoD-managed schools.  More specifically, the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) provides schooling for eligible DoD military and civilian dependents from preschool through grade 12 with two programs: the DoD Domestic Dependents Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) for dependent students at locations within the United States, and the DoD Dependents Schools (DoDDS) for dependent students residing in foreign countries.  The DDESS system serves an estimated 36,360 students in 70 schools located in seven states, Guam and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The DoDDS system serves about 76,428 students in 154 schools in 13 countries.  As many as 650,000 school-age students of military members may be enrolled in public school systems surrounding military installations in the United States.  In the past, DoD has not played a major role in advocating for these military children.  However, in the year 2000, DoD established the Educational Opportunities Directorate (Ed Op) and chartered it to address transition issues associated with the education of students of mobile military families. Ed Op has been charged with helping to increase connections between military and civilian community schools to address educational issues and concerns affecting the quality of kindergarten through 12th grade educational opportunities for all military students, whether in DoD or in local school districts in the United States.  The end result should be a continuum of quality education for all military children regardless of where their parents are assigned.  Beginning in the fall of 2000, Roundtables were established as one of the means by which Ed Op would begin to accomplish its mission.  SCOPE OF WORK: Contractors will perform planning, execution and follow-up for the DoD Roundtable: Education Issues of the Mobile Military Child in the Seattle area of the state of Washington on 26-27 February 2002.  The Roundtable will consist of approximately 100 participants including: Installation commanders and the top enlisted persons from major Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard bases in the state of Washington; 20 military dependent high school students selected from public schools in the Tacoma-Seattle area; Parents from major Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard installations in the state of Washington; State Legislators repre

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a 5 year (base year plus four option years) cost plus award fee contract for the redesign and maintenance of the Common Working File System (CWF). The CWF system was established to provide a single data source where Fiscal Intermediaries and Carriers could verify beneficiary eligibility and receive prepayment review and approval of claims.  The entire CWF database is comprised of 9 designated data centers called Hosts whereby each Host provides beneficiary entitlement and adjudication data to Medicare contractors within a specific geographic area.  Additional background information will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.  Computer Sciences Corporation, Federal Sector - Civil Group, of Lanham, MD is currently performing the CWF maintenance.
 
 CMS intends to make a single award to one prime contractor for both the redesign and maintenance efforts to ensure that both efforts are accomplished with the minimum amount of risk to the current operations and future implementation of quarterly releases.  The use of a single contractor for both the maintenance and redesign efforts will mitigate the possibility of potential conflicts during the resynchronization of the redesigned system into the quarterly release environment. 

The CWF maintenance contractor shall update and maintain the standard CWF computer software. The maintenance contractor shall incorporate system requirements, including requirements specified in Program Memoranda (PMs), Change Requests (CRs), Joint Signature letters, and all manuals issued by CMS. The primary activities within this area include: Requirements development and maintenance; Changes or corrections to program code, User-requested changes or enhancements; Data dictionary maintenance, including major updates to coding tables; System and user documentation; JCL development; Database maintenance; System enhancements, and Coordination/integration with CWF redesign efforts.

The CWF is an aging system and needs to be redesigned to ensure a more efficient and effective system that will be able to accommodate program growth.  The CWF must be redesigned to remove obsolete code and convoluted logic, and must be made more flexible, reliable, and efficient to address requirements resulting from legislative and other mandates.  Agency plans for long-range improvements in program integrity, pre-payment auditing, melding of the Part A and Part B services, and deductibles and coverage for more benefits demand a more contemporary and flexible design for CWF. This effort entails developing a redesign for CWF and reengineering the existing CWF software, implementing and testing this software, and providing training and operational support. The primary activities within this area include: Create a software development management plan; Document and maintain system and software requirements; Develop system design; Develop incremental build strategy; Code, test, and integrate redesign with the current CWF; Implement CWF at Host Sites; Use project management techniques (e.g., Earned Value; Develop user manuals and conduct training; Analyze and implement DB2 Database structure 

CMS will require use of an incentive subcontracting plan to encourage participation by Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses.  Any businesses interested in subcontracting
or teaming opportunities may contact CMS to be put on a source list, which will be furnished to interested offerors. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued o/a February 1st, 2002.  Vendors are encouraged to register under this synopsis to have notification sent when documents and correspondence are available for this solicitation.

<CONTACT>Michael Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 208-4949, Fax (202) 501-3161, Email michael.jackson@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Office of FirstGov, has a requirement for Focus Group/Usability Tests and Interim Redesign of FirstGov.gov.  Specifically 
FirstGov.gov requires contractor support to conduct focus groups/usability tests and develop an interim redesign of the existing site.  This activity is a precursor to a larger effort that includes deployment of a content management system, integration of other FirstGov business system components (i.e. customer relationship management system), and a major redesign of the site to include information architecture reconfiguration.  

The purpose of the focus groups/usability tests is to gain customer reaction/feedback to the FirstGov site to inform how best to reorganize/position existing content to highlight the following:  online transactions;  three primary customer channels (i.e. government to government, citizen to government, and business to government); government shopping;  and topical information.  The results of the test will provide the foundation for an interim redesign of the existing site.  The interim redesign will reposition existing content, form new content categories, feature graphical improvements, and position FirstGov to easily implement future features.

The contractor shall provide the following services:

Task 1:  Usability Tests
1.	One planning meeting with FirstGov staff to discuss design of the focus groups/usability tests, identify key stakeholders to interview, and determine test logistics and recruitment of participants that meet FirstGov?s demographic specifications. 
2.	Development of a test plan to include the following: the test purpose, the problem statement, test objectives, test method, test environment, facilitator role, evaluation measures/methods, the test questions, agendas, and any other relevant supportive materials.  The test plan shall be developed together with FirstGov staff. 
3.	Facilitators, observers, and note takers for each test group who will record general impressions of the sessions and consolidate notations to include as part of a summary report.
4.	Logistical planning for tests to include recruitment of participants, scheduling of testing facilities, and incentives for participation.
5.	Conduct up to three usability tests and one-to-one interviews with up to four key stakeholders.
6.	Meet with CMS deployment team upon completion of the tests to share key lessons learned that should be considered as part of the deployment effort.
7.	Analysis of user feedback in terms of specific options for redesign.

Task 2:  Interim Redesign
1.	Develop a plan for repositioning of existing site content/services and formation of new content categories based on usability findings.
2.	Assess existing template design and make and implement suggestions 
for improved template design to support recommendations. 
3.	Develop a plan to migrate content to any newly developed templates.
4.	Conduct graphical improvements, improve current look and feel
(i.e. buttons, enhance graphics, search box etc.).
5.	Assist FirstGov staff in implementation of site wide changes.

B.  Deliverable:  

1.	Up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.
2.	A Usability Report to include findings from the tests, recommendations for changes, and a plan for implementation.
3.	An improved site design hosted on templates that includes an enhanced graphical image.  The improved design should feature recommendations cited in the Usability Report.

Task Standard:  The Usability Report shall be delivered in electronic format using Microsoft Word.  The report shall be understandable and contain a narrative of the usability findings and details regarding the testing method.  The report shall include a heuristic evaluation of the sites usability and resulting options for redesign.  The site redesign reflects the usability findings and a graphical image that is on par with (for example) the California State Portal site.

This effort maintains continuity of the Industrial Graduate Internship Program in Human Factors Engineering for ARL-HRED.  The objective of this specific effort is to determine the interactiv e effects of physical and mental workload on subjective workload assessment and to examine the impact of critical dimensions of physical workload on mental workload assessment.  Several common existing tools will be used to assess physical and mental workl oads separately under situations of combined workload.  The research includes extreme conditions and a variety of environments experienced in military tasks.  The results will be used to develop a subjective workload assessment tool that can determine over all workload levels when both physical and mental demands exist.  An ARL Technical Report will document the findings of the research.  Negotiations are planned solely with Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech has a unique capability and expertise with the experien ces of its faculty and staff in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department (ISE).   Since the establishment of the ISE's Human Factors Engineering Center in 1985, Virginia Tech faculty, staff, and graduate students have conducted numerous human fact ors experiments encompassing a broad range of issues.  The Industrial Ergonomics Laboratory (IEL) is a unique facility for the conduct of experiments on complex human-system interaction, biomechanics, and physical workload.  The IEL, along with the technic al expertise of the IEL personnel, places Virginia Tech in a unique position to support this requirement.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability.  Capabilities statement referencing W813LT 2002-7014 must be faxed to Jeanine Worthing ton, 410-278-6522.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>Additional Q&As regarding GS00A02PDR0001

1.	Question: In the Q&A you provided earlier today, the following question and its associated answer was presented as follows:

?Q: Under Task 1 and later under Deliverable it says ?up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.  Does this really mean up to three focus groups and four sets of one-on-one usability tests ? one for each stakeholder group?  This makes more sense for what is typically done in usability testing.

A:  No.  We expect three focus groups and/or group usability sessions, up to three one-on-one usability tests, as well as four interviews with stakeholders.?

Our question is directly related to the three one-on-one usability tests.  Does this mean 1) no more than three individuals are involved in the one-on-one usability tests (three tests, three individuals), or 2) three separate test sessions made up of multiple one-on-one usability tests involving one individual per test?


Answer: Please refer to the Statement of Work which clearly states the deliverable as up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.  Disregard the reference in the response of up to three one-on-one usability tests and three focus groups.  The only requirements are up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.


2.	Question:  The following question and its associated answer was presented as follows:

?Q: How many designs or templates do you want?

  A:  We require up to 14 templates ? four levels into three customer segments plus two other customized pages.?

Our question is directly related to the four levels.  Would you please provide further clarification regarding your definition of the levels to ensure we respond appropriately to the requirement?

Answer:  The site hosts over one hundred pages.  Please refer to the existing site.  FirstGov is interested in your plan for template and page design.  Levels can be defined as index pages and sub pages related to them.

<DESC>Additional Q&As

1.	The subject solicitation stipulates a 10-page limitation on the offeror?s proposal.  My question is: is a font size of 10 acceptable, or must it be a font size of 12?

Answer: 12 

2.	Does the electronic version of the proposal need to be limited to 10 pages?

Answer:  The technical proposal when printed out must not exceed 10 pages.

3.	What is the definition of a small business for purposes of this solicitation?  Is it a certain amount of receipts per year for the company?  If so, what is the amount?  There is a mention of a Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.  Is this the threshold of the project award amount, or is it the threshold of the amount of annual receipts of the company that is to be considered a small business for purposes of this solicitation?

Answer: The Simplified Acquisition Threshold is $100,000.  The Government estimates that the cost of this effort will be under this threshold of $100,000 therefore this procurement has to be reserved for small business.  The Government defines a small business for this procurement using the NAICS code 541512 and the size standard of $18 million a year.

4.	We need clarification on exactly how many groups and interviews to bid on.  And are the ?interviews? also one-on-ones at a facility using a computer, or are they telephone interviews, or some other type of interview?

Answer:  This deliverable is stated very clearly in the Statement of Work.  Please see Deliverable B under Task 2 Interim Redesign.  The bidder should determine how best to conduct these interviews and submit this as part of their proposal.

5.	Does the administering authority of FirstGov employ a current set of usability metrics, e.g.., accessibility, form use, performance, maintainability, ease of navigation, readability, etc.?

Answer: Yes, some.

Should the bidder examine and incorporate these measures as protocols for this project?  If so, what method may a prospective bidder use to access the current usability metrics?

Answer: This should be referenced as a step the bidder will take however it is not necessary that each protocol is addressed specifically in the proposal.

6.	What is the purpose of conducting Focus Groups?  To establish a graphical direction for your site, or are you thinking you will be able to drive requirements for future redesign from this data?

Answer:  To establish a graphical direction, improve the information architecture, and to drive future designs.

Is an alternative to Focus Group testing acceptable as an alternative in our proposal, as long as it meets the requirement for obtaining needed information about your users?

Answer: Yes.


7.	Given that the period of performance is now specified as 6 months, do you still expect that the bidder?s ?project leader? will be engaged full-time on this project during that 6 month period of performance?

Answer:  There should not be more than one project leader assigned to FirstGov.  This is important for consistency of project management.  There will be some time when the project leader will be working full time with FirstGov but we don?t anticipate that this will be for the duration of the project.  There should be one point of contact (the project leader) with the contractor.  We understand that other individuals may be assigned to handle certain aspects of the project, however project management tasks should be handled by the project leader.

<DESC>Are there any points of the test plan that the government has already identified (mission critical or otherwise) that are to be included in this plan? 

Yes. See next answer.

If yes, can this information be made available to prospective offerors/bidders prior to bid submission deadline with enough time allowed to incorporate into a responsive proposal?

This information will be made available at the time of the award.

Has the government received feedback to clearly identify areas in the problem statement, which will be required to be addressed during the performance period? 

Yes, but the information is not sufficient. See next answer.

If so, can the government provide a copy or statement of problems, which have already been identified and will most likely be included in the test plan.

No.  The awardee will help categorize and rank the issues or opportunities we have identified and help identify others.

Whose responsibility is payment of participant incentives, the government, or the contractors, since the contract is being awarded as a ?firm fixed price? this is an important element?

Participants can be volunteers.  Otherwise, participant incentives are at the expense of the contractor, which are part of the contract costs.

Can the costs associated with recruitment (facilities are already at government expense) and participant incentives, be modified (in the contract) to become direct costs, which are then paid by the contract, then billed to the government as a direct cost to the contract?

All costs associated with performance should be in the price proposal.

There are three primary customers they list - citizens, businesses, and governments.  Are there any further specifications around these customers (e.g. governments to include state, city, county governments, or for citizens to include all or only those who are online experienced?)

Participants -- government employees from all levels of government and citizens must be computer literate, and all must have at least a small amount of experience online.

Under Task 1 and later under Deliverable it says "up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews". Does this really mean up to three focus groups and four sets of one-on-one usability tests-one for each stakeholder group? This make more sense for what is typically done in usability testing.

No. We expect three focus groups and/or group usability sessions, up to three one-on-one usability tests, as well as four interviews with stakeholders. 

Are there key finds you?re looking for through usability testing?

Yes, what the consumer market wants and needs.

Are we correct in assuming that these stakeholders are government employees who would participate as part of their job, and thus there would be no need to recruit them or compensate them for there time? 

We expect to use a few government employees, but contractors should expect to recruit from the appropriate levels of government.  They will not have to be compensated if tests are done during workday hours.

Should the cost portion of a submitted response include the cost of participant incentives?

Yes, however, some of the participants can be volunteers, such as government employees.

What stakeholders are anticipated to be participants in the in-depth 
interviews?

	We will provide this guidance at the time of the contract award.

The solicitation specifies 3 usability tests; we assume that each test will be with one of the three audiences outlined in the statement of work--consumers, business, and government audiences. Is this correct? Are "government" audiences defined simply as individuals who work for the Federal government in some capacity?

The three audiences are correct. The contractor can mix audiences in the sessions. Government employees can be local, state, federal, or tribal employees.

In what ways is the California site judged to be superior? Is this

<DESC>Questions about the solicitation for Focus Group/Usability Tests and Interim Redesign of FirstGov.gov

We received many questions about this solicitation. We have condensed some of the questions, eliminated redundant questions, and put what was left into categories. 

Proposal Submission Date

There are two submission dates in the requirement, 12/19 and 12/21. What is the correct date you want the submission of the response?

The two submission dates of 12/19 and 12/21 was an error that was corrected by Modification 1 to this solicitation.  Modification 1 made it clear that the correct submission date was 12/21.  However, GSA has decided to extend the date for receipt of proposals from 12/21/01 to a new date of 12/28/01 by 3:00 pm, EST.  Electronic submission (e-mail) of proposal is preferred.  The e-mail address is Michael.Jackson@gsa.gov.  However, if an offeror does not possess e-mail capability, please send the hard copy of the proposal to Michael O. Jackson/MVF, General Services Administration, Office of Acquisition Policy, 1800 F Street, Room 4006, Washington, DC, 20405.  The hard copy of the proposal must reach Mr. Jackson by 3:00 pm, EST, December 28, 2001.     

Are you expecting actual proposal responses to this presolicitation notice by 12/21/2001, or will there be an actual RFP (etc.) released?  If an RFP is forthcoming, when do you anticipate its release?

Proposals are due by 12/28/01, 3:00pm, EST. The requirement was published as a ?combined synopsis/solicitation?; therefore the notice constitutes the solicitation also.

Award Date

When is the estimated award date?

	January 2002

Deadline for Questions

Is there a deadline for submitting questions?

The deadline for submission of questions is 3:00 pm, EST, Wednesday, December 19, 2001.

Contract Duration

What are your desired completion dates for each of the two major project tasks: 1) Focus Group/Usability Tests, 2) Interim Redesign of FirstGov.gov?

The performance period in the combined synopsis/solicitation notice is modified as follows:

Work on the focus group and usability tests and the attendant report and recommendations must be completed 60 days after award of the contract.  Preliminary design plans must be submitted within 90 days after the award. Work on the redesign plan must be completed within 6 months after the award.

Contract Process and Management

Are services required to be performed on site full time or will point of contact via the project manager suffice?

The contractor should propose the strategy he/she feels most appropriate to meet all of the Government?s requirements.        

Although the link to the FAR is a dead link, we did find the Reps and
Certs.  Are there any other business proposal instructions that we should be aware of?

See various Q&As throughout this modification.

Do you want the proposal delivered in paper or electronically? If paper, how many copies? If electronically, will Word and Excel work?  File size limitations?

Proposal should be delivered electronically in a Microsoft Word document. Microsoft Excel is also acceptable.   Printed, hard copy of technical proposal cannot exceed ten pages.  This ten-page limitation does not include attachments for resumes and past performance.  Each offeror is requested to provide three past performance references for similar work.  As well as a brief summary of each reference, please provide names and current phone numbers for each of the three past performance references.  There is no page limitation for the price proposal.

What is the expected level of participation of FirstGov staff?  Specifically, how many resources, what general skills, and what time commitment can we expect to support joint project tasks?

Full participation from project leader, with other resources and skills as needed.

What is the decision process for a contract award (oral presentations, reference demonstrations, etc.)?

There are no oral prese

<DESC>The Department of Transportation, Transportation Acquisition Service Center (TASC), Information Technology Omnibus Procurement, a Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC) that has been granted authority to issue information technology (IT) service contracts for all public sector programs, is seeking to identify sources for Government-wide multiple award contracts for Expert Acquisition Support Service and Products.

The federal acquisition community (including both the information technology/CIO community and the procurement community) has been subject to significant reform initiatives over the past several years.  These reform measures ? such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), as well as the more recent Presidential and OMB directives to increase the use of performance-based contracting techniques have significantly changed the federal government?s approach to acquiring goods and services. 

Many federal agencies are having difficulties fully understanding and implementing these reform measures and streamlining practices and procedures.  There is a shortage of experience and expertise in effectively implementing acquisition reform measures. 

Finally, acquisition organizations across government are beset with a dwindling resource pool, both in terms of reduced funding (in many instances), reduced in-house expertise, and reduced staffing, both in technical and contractual support of the acquisition process.  This problem is exacerbated by the recent inclusion of inherently governmental functions on the FAIR Act inventory requiring Agencies to seek alternatives to existing acquisition management functions currently accomplished by in-house staff.  The legislative requirements, regulatory initiatives and dwindling resource pool all combine to require acquisition organizations to take innovative and aggressive steps to plan, control, and manage acquisitions.  This not only includes innovative ways to manage existing contracts, but also innovative ways to acquire new or additional resources.  Thus, there is a broad need for expert acquisition support services and products.  Therefore, TASC ITOP seeks to establish a broad suite of acquisition support capability that would provide such capability to any government agency in an efficient, cost effective manner.  

Therefore, and in accordance with the FAR 15.202 advisory multi-step process, TASC ITOP seeks statements of qualifications from firms who provide a broad suite of acquisition support services.  Firms may submit proposed technical concepts for satisfying this requirement, past performance information, and limited pricing information.  On the basis of responses received, as provided by the FAR, TASC will notify each respondent either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  

After such notice, an RFP will be issued to those firms invited to compete and any other firms who request to participate.

Documentation should be sent to U.S Department of Transpportation, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Attn: Mona-Lisa Dunn, Room 5106, Washington, DC 20590.  Questions may be referred to Mona-Lisa Dunn at 202-366-5840 or e-mail at mona-lisa.dunn@tasc.dot.gov.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify capable potential responsible sources only, does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Governmennt does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for any information solicited.  Responses shall be submitted in one original and two copies and are llimited to 3-7 pages.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory is in need of a modern power drive system for two existing DC Dynamometers.  Heavy duty test cells #3 and #4 are equipped with GE 380hp electric double ended reversing dynamometers.  A motor-generator set and original GE controls power the dynamometers.  The dynamometer systems were installed in the 1970's.  The scope of activity in this procurement is to replace the motor generators and GE controls with modern Digital DC Drives and a manual dynamometer controller. Heavy Duty Test Cells #3 and #4 are Engine Dynamometer Test Cells.  The test cells are designed to run steady state exhaust emission tests on methanol, gasoline and diesel engines.  The engines are used on research projects for the Advanced Technology Division and typically have rated power value range of 0 to 380hp.  The engines are directly coupled to the dynamometer with a vibration dampening drive shaft.  The testing consists of steady state mode operation.  During the steady mode testing, the exhaust emissions can be sampled and measured along with many other parameters including actual engine power output.  Finally, emission rates are calculated to yield brake specific results or according to US Federal Standards (40 CFR 86) and standards from other international governing bodies. The contractor will provide for electrical disconnection of all old equipment, installation of new equipment, connection of new equipment to power grid and dynamometer, drive commissioning, and training of EPA personnel.  The procurement is for a drive system and a manual dynamometer controller it makes no further requirement of integrating the drive/controller/dynamometer system will be a stand alone unit.  The EPA will provide the necessary utilities, with proper capacity, to the site.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information.  There is not currently an RFP nor funding for this project.  This is only to seek contractor input.  The Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) is seeking contractor input into the development of a requirement for the development of a computerized assessment and case management tool for the United States Air Force Alchohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (US ADAPT) Program.  To receive further information on this requirement send e mail requests to clifford.trowbridge@gsa.gov.  The purpose of this tool is to computerize and standardize the intake and clinical assessment that patients complete following a referal to the ADAPT program.  This computerized assessment will collect and store demographic and identifying information about the patient, past personal and family history and information about the patient's substance abuse.  A case management component will also be required in order to track individuals over time during their treatment and allow for periodic follow-up clinical assessment measures to be delivered via the software application.

<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>NA The previously issued Market Research Announcement for the Airbourne Standoff Mine Detection System (ASTAMIDS) is hereby withdrawn and replaced with the following:  The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) and the Project Manager for Mines, C ountermine and Demolitions (PM-MCD), Countermine Division is seeking information from industry on their capabilities to design, develop, test, and produce a system that meets the operational requirements of the Airborne Standoff Minefield Detection System (ASTAMIDS).  CECOM and PM-MCD are also seeking information on the availability of commercial systems, non-developmental items (NDI), and/or individual commercial/NDI developments and components that can be used in or as a part of an ASTAMIDS system.  The A STAMIDS will provide forward deployed troops with a Brigade asset that can be used in Tactical Operations in day and night to detect and locate obstacles and surface and recently buried minefields in near real time (NRT) using existing or modified visible/ EO/IR sensors on the current or near term Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, (TUAV). The ASTAMIDS system will consist of the two major components.  The first major component, an airborne payload package is the set of capabilities carried by the aerial platf orm.  The payload package can be removed/installed as a unit.  It includes the sensor(s), pre-processors, navigation/controlling hardware/software, enhanced data link and/or data relays.  The payload package will be of modular design, tailored through open  system architecture approach.  Available common data links/relays, communications, command and control (C3) systems will be utilized to the maximum extent possible.  The second major component, a ground station composed of the data management, processing,  and command, control and communications (C3) functionality will be implemented through a common Army Ground Station that will be minimally modified to interface the ASTAMIDS airborne payload. The ASTAMIDS ground station will be capable of processing airbo rne payload data, finding and locating threat minefields and obstacles and communicating that information to using units.  Firms possessing the capabilities to satisfy the ASTAMIDS requirements through design and development and/or possessing the commercia l/NDI systems or commercial/NDI system components to satisfy the ASTAMIDS requirements are invited to submit documentation to the Point of Contact herein to include a (1) statement of qualification, (2) product literature, (3) previous experience with simi lar systems, (4) current GSA or other schedule information (if applicable), and (5) price schedules/catalogues (if applicable) .  Respondents must also include information regarding  (1) customary practices, including warranty, discounts, etc., under which  commercial sales of the products are made and (2) requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the item being acquired.

<DESC>NA OBJECTIVE FORCE WARRIOR  Classification Code: A - Research and Development Subject: Pre-Solicitation Notice - Objective Force Warrior (OFW) MULTI-FUNCTIONAL COMBAT SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS Solicitation Number: DAAD16-02-R-0004 The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center at the Soldier Biological and Chemical Command, Natick, MA has a requirement for concept development, design, fabrication and delivery of prototypes for an Objective Force Warrior (OFW) multi-functional combat system of systems.  The OFW program goal is to develop an overwhelmingly lethal, highly survivable, lightweight, low power, situational aware, strategically deployable, highly mobile, sustainable, and cost effective warfighter combat system of systems.  The program is currently in the 6.3 Concept and Technology Development Phase and is planned for transition into 6.4/6.5 System Development and Demonstration Phase at the end of FY06.  The preliminary notice for this project was published in the Commerce Business Daily  and FedBizzOps on 10/22/01 and amended.  A draft solicitation was released 1/4/02 and a pre-proposal conference conducted January 17-19, 2002.  The Government intends to employ 'Other Transactions for Prototype Projects' agreement(s) for this acquisition.   The Natick Contracting Division of the U. S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center (RMAC-NCD) will be delegated authority to award '845 Other Transactions for Prototypes' as authorized by Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization Acts, which may be found  in U. S. Code as a Note in 10 U.S.C. 2371, Section 845 of Public Law 103-160, as amended.  The delegation is anticipated to be effected not later than January 31, 2002.  This statute authorizes the use of Other Transactions for prototype projects directly  relevant to weapons or weapon systems.  In accordance with this statute, there must be at least one non-traditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent in the prototype project; or if no non-traditional defense contractor is participa ting to a significant extent in the prototype project, at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by the parties to the transaction other than the federal government.   The RMAC-NCD anticipates the award of up to two (2) agreements with a down-selection to one Lead Systems Integrator consortia or team for Phases II and III, and the SDD Option.  The OFW Program consists of three phases with an optional Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase.  Phase I is a nine-month effort for OFW Concept Development as defined in Final OFW Solicitation DAAD16-02-R-0004.  The Phase I deliverables include monthly reports, briefings, final report summarizing activities delineated i n the final solicitation, and two (2) non-functional mockup prototype systems.  Offerors will be required to proposed costs for Phase I only at the time of proposal submission.    Phase II is a Preliminary and Detailed Design phase lasting 27 months.  The consortia/team will refine system and subsystem design culminating in a detailed design package.  A Preliminary Design Review will be required during Phase II.  Phase III will be for Demonstration Build, Training, and Demonstration and delivery of 50 proto type systems.  Phase III shall be 18 months in duration.  The consortia/team shall train demonstration unit personnel, government trainer demonstration personnel, and verify system component and subsystem operation and interoperability.    The consortia/te am shall perform analysis and corrective actions as required during this phase.  If the Government wishes to exercise its option for the SDD Phase, PEO Soldier will manage that phase.  Although the solicitation and all attachments are unclassified, access to Secret or NATO sensitive information is expected for some portions of these agreements, and companies should have, or have the ability to obtain, a Secret clearance and storage facilities as outlined in the Nat

ONLY SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The  EPC Coordinating Center will function as an extension of the Agency's staff administering the Evidence-based Practice Centers Program (EPC Program).  The EPCs developed evidence reports and technology assessments that are rigorous systematic reviews and analysis of scientific literature. The EPC reports and assessments are used by systems of care, provider societies, health plans, public and private purchasers, States, and others, as a scientific foundation for development and implementation of their own clinical practice guidelines, clinical pathways, review criteria, performance measures, educational curricula, and other quality improvements tools. The reports and assessments also are used to inform reimbursement or coverage policies.  The Coordinating Center will serve as a central link between AHRQ, the EPCs, Partners (i.e., organizations whose nominated topics are selected for EPC evidence reports or technology assessments become AHRQ Partners), researchers, providers, and others who are committed to the organization and delivery of evidence-based health care.  For illustrative purposes only, the EPC Coordinating Center may be tasked to: (a) assess need for updating past EPC evidence reports and technology assessments, including development of a strategy for addressing the backlog; (b) perform literature searches on topics nominated for an EPC evidence report or technology assessment; (c) convene and provide support for an EPC Scientific Committee; (d) plan and convene national conferences; (d) plan and coordinate annual EPC meetings; (f) develop criteria and protocols for scanning published and gray literature to identify topics that maybe ripe for development of an evidence report or technology assessment; (g) establish and maintain contact with Partners and other professional societies, providers, payors, etc. to assist in their efforts to disseminate products based on EPC reports and assessments and measure use of such products, as well as the impact of such use on clinical care; (h) manage a database of EPC reports and assessments, including responding to user inquiries; (j) collect and provide EPC program data.  Offerors are expected to have clinical, methodological, and management expertise and experience in: performing systematic searches of the scientific literature, including development of the appropriate search strategy and searching multiple complex databases; expertise and experience in assessing the quality of scientific literature; working with professional societies, providers, researchers, and others; management of a database, including responding appropriately and promptly to user inquiries; and planning and implementing large conferences as well as smaller expert meetings.  The EPC Coordinating Center is to be comprised of experienced/seasoned professionals, including those with training and competencies in clinical care, research methodology, library sciences, scientific writing and editing, database management, and meeting planning and implementation.  The Director of the Coordinating Center and other senior staff who will manage work to be performed under this contract should hold an advanced clinical, technical or professional degree, at the M.D. or Ph.D., level with a minimum of 8 years experience in performing evidence-based systematic reviews and analyzing biomedical, social sciences, behavioral, epidemiological or outcomes data, or similar scientific literature, research findings and data, and, preferably, will have significant experience related to development of clini

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) is seeking interested sources to provide Operator and Maintenance Related Training, to include Operator Proficiency training for the Joint Tactical Terminal and Common Integrated Broadcast Service-Mo dules (JTT-B/CIBS-M) - Briefcase Version  and Maintainer/Maintenance for the Joint Tactical Terminal and Common Integrated Broadcast Service-Modules (JTT/CIBS-M).  Respondents (otherwise referred to as the 'training service provider') should provide inform ation regarding their institutional capabilities to meet these training needs as described below. General Equipment Description:  The JTT comprises a family of tactical terminals and modules used for multiple path data communications.  The terminals deliver critical, time sensitive battlefield targeting information to tactical commanders and intelligen ce nodes from all military services, in near real time.  The JTT is interoperable with the Tactical Reconnaissance Intelligence exchange System (TRIXS), Tactical Information Broadcast Service (TIBS), Tactical and Related Applications (TRAP) Data Disseminat ion System (TDDS), TActical Data Information eXchange Subsystem B (TADIXS-B), and UHF General Purpose Link (GPL) networks.  The Government currently has an active contract (DAAB07-97-C-J437) with Raytheon C3I Systems Company, St Petersburg, Florida to acqu ire JTT systems and Common Integrated Broadcast Service Modules (CIBS-M). The JTT-B is a man portable stand-alone version of the JTT.  It provides Secondary Imagery Dissemination System (SIDS) and Tactical Data Information Link - A (TADIL-A) receive and display capability.  The JTT-B components include the JTT-B Receiver, access ory kits and laptop data processor/display with Commercial/Government-Off-The- Shelf (COTS/GOTS) installed software.  The JTT-B uses GOTS Tactical Data Processor (TDP) software (Falconview with Threat Database and SIDEARM - NT).  The essential and auxiliar y accessory kits contain full complement of antennas, preamplifiers, and cables necessary for reception of Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Networks. The training being sought includes both Operator and Maintenance/Maintainer Training for the JTT-B.  The training will be designed to ensure that user personnel are qualified to operate and maintain the JTT-B system.  The training course duration is an ant icipated to be 2 weeks/80 hours.  In addition, support for one week of Operator Proficiency Training will be required for operational test players and will be used to support a Logistics Demo.  These courses will provide End-to-End Operator/Maintenance Tra ining.  This training will include System Introduction, Networks Overviews, Installation and Setup (cabling, antennas, crypto loading).  They will also provide training for the JTT Control Client (JCC), software that configures the JTT-B, performs file man agement and provides status alerts.  The JTT-B uses two Tactical Data Processors (TDP), namely, FalconView with Threat Database and SIDEARM.  Training for these TDPs will be from a CONOPS and Doctrine & Tactical Training (DTT ) perspective.  The Government  will request up to 6 training courses over a period of not to exceed 2 years, or until formalized training is established at TRADOC.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of intent to extend services on F04684-96-C-0038 (ROMSSC)
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The 30th Space Wing intends to extend the Range Operations, Maintenance, and Support Services Contract (ROMSSC) #F04684-96-0038 with ITT Industries, for a period of twelve months (1Apr 02 through 30 Mar 03).  By extending the ROMSSC Contract, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new eight year Western Range Operations, Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (WROC4) Services Contract is being competed under F04684-01-R-0008.

The current ROMSSC Contract provides support to the overall diversified mission of the 14 AF, 30 SW, 30 OG, 30 CS, range operations, associated unit operations, and commercial launch agencies.  This contract provides operations, maintenance, and support services to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR).  The WR embraces a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean.  Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites, and in the Hawaiian Islands. The scope of work encompasses the capability to operate and maintain control centers and Range facilities while providing for future planning, flight safety, technical studies, and analysis support.  Also included are resource control and scheduling for systems assignment, status reporting, systems maintenance and repairs, downtime modifications and real time operations.  Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements.  WR receives and provides Range support to and from Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45 SW, 452 FTS, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), and Kwajalein Missile Range.  The 30 SW is responsible for providing a fully instrumented Range capability to conduct and support activities for spacelift, ballistic missile, tactical military operations and aeronautical programs.  The WR is a designated Major Range Test Facility Base in support of federal and non-federal users.

All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, development of O&M procedures, and obtaining of certifications and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of ROMSSC services or change to launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the aggressive launch schedule, the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from the interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay to launch schedules.  Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Velma Davis within 15 day of this publication.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request For Proposal(RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.
A.	Fuze Design 
1.	What are the major risks associated with air-to-ground fuze acquisition?
2.	What are the specific driving technology challenges to the development of electronic or electro-mechanical fuzes?  
3.	What risks do you associate with using an air-driven power supply for an electronic or electro-mechanical fuze?  What means do you suggest to mitigate each risk?  
4.	One required performance baseline for the FMU-152 fuze is releases at up to 50,000 feet MSL at airspeeds as low as 200 knots calibrated (KCAS).  Higher altitude releases are envisioned.  Please explain how design safety issues (MIL?STD?1316) drive design solutions and include any design concepts you have to meet these increasing challenges.  
5.	What do you estimate are the practical limits for altitude and airspeed when using an air-driven turbine?  What alternatives have you considered?  What risks and mitigation ideas are associated with your alternatives.  
6.	Are the design risks different for general purpose fuzes compared to hardened penetration fuzes?  
Production
1.  Considering the previous questions on "risk", to what extent are risks for production generated in these areas?  What are your ideas for production risk mitigation?  
2.  What can the Government do to help reduce programmatic risks?  What initiatives or incentives would be appropriate for a fuze development or follow-on production effort?  Include existing contractual provisions, modifications of existing provisions, and substantially new ideas.  
3.  How does the workforce availability drive any design aspect or production capability?  For example, is there an adequate talent pool for technologically advanced fuzes?  
4.  What is an efficient production rate for fuzes similar to the FMU?152 in design complexity?  Which processes are rate limiting?  What would you change to correct these limitations?  
5.  What production rate would you be able to manage without additional capital investment.  At what point during a production contract would you require the resulting assets?  What do you estimate as the lead time?  
6.  What is your assessment of the health of the US fuze industrial base?  What, if any, actions should be taken to improve it?  
7.  Identify any factor that you perceive to impede your pursuing a government fuze contract.  
8.  Roughly estimate your anticipated schedule for developing a new fuze with JPF-like performance but a different design.  Identify your major milestones and include any major assumptions.  
9.  Please identify any additional comments on a recommended future acquisition strategy and contracting approach.  
Other:  
1.  After collecting answers on the questions below, the team anticipates conducting follow-up telephone interviews (target: 23-25 Jan 2002) with interested companies.  Please indicate the name and phone number of the appropriate Point of Contact within your organization.   Thank you.

The purpose of this synopsis is to publicize the fact that the Okanogan and Wenatchee National Forests intend to negotiate a contract with the current contractor, Hart Crowser from Seattle, WA, for the above referenced work done under the authority provided in the FAR, Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The justification for the transaction is based upon a superior knowledge of site (five years of performing oversight review and analysis of responsible party submittals), critical stage of project, and resultant overall benefit to the government and public.  Hart Crowser was originally awarded a contract for similar activities with an anticipated life of no more than five (5) years.  As a result of some performance shortcomings on the part of the responsible party, the cleanup is anticipated to last another 3-5 years.  The total value of the contract is estimated between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The NAICS code is 541620.
