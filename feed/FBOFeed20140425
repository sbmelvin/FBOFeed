<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products. <br>  <br> For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation. <br>  <br> After contract award, up to thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government test and integration activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and Software Integration Laboratory activities), with hardware deliveries to commence no later than sixty (60) days after contract award.   <br>  <br> The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.   <br>  <br> The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is 16 May 2014, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice will be posted when the formal RFP is available, with response dates and instructions as applicable to this solicitation. <br>  <br> ACC-APG intends to solicit and award, via full and open competition, a single Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contract with a One-Year base period and three (3) One-Year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated services.  Approximately 120 SALT systems in addition to the estimated 30 test and integration units may be acquired during the option periods of any resultant contract. <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to award a contract in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process. <br>  <br> Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. <br>  <br> Updated information for this solicitation, in response to comments and questions received from interested sources related to the draft solicitation as announced on 17 January 2014 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV, may be posted prior to the date when the formal solicitation is released.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor this website. <br>  <br> The above discussed intent is subject to change. <br>  <br> Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil or donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted. <br>  <br> All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified above.  Interested parties shall not contact any other Government personnel other than the persons identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individuals identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>  <br> All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked.  Any documentation provided will not be returned. <br>  <br> No Classified information shall be submitted in response to this pre-solicitation notice. <br>  <br> This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor the FedBizOpps website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>

<DESC>The Government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price type contract to IERUS Technologies, 2904 Westcorp Boulevard, Suite 210, Huntsville, AL 35805-6410.  The DoD has a requirement for an effort that will model and measure microwave and millimeter wave scattering from various test objects, perform high-resolution reconstructions using appropriate transforms, and demonstrate compact data links.  IERUS Technologies is uniquely qualified to test and evaluate the performance of two Doppler radars designed to measure the velocity profiles of hundreds of high-speed fragments following a controlled explosion or intercept in DoD test ranges.  IERUS Technologies is the only company that can deploy these Doppler radars during live testing, acquire data, and provide detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of the velocity profiles.  IERUS Technologies has the unique capability to develop a millimeter wave synthetic aperture radar and demonstrate its performance through high resolution reconstructions of various test objects using millimeter waves.  Based upon this information, IERUS Technologies is the only known provider that can meet the Government's requirements.  No other known source will satisfy the agency's requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be fully considered by the agency.  The point of contact for this effort is Ms. Angela Keaton-Simpson, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-842-7406, e-mail angela.l.keatonsimpson.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br>

One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<SUBJECT>Characteristics and Predictors of Occasional Seat Belt use Using SHRP2 Data
<SOLNBR>DTNH22-14-R-00027
<CONTACT>Melissa R. Tyson, Email melissa.tyson@dot.gov - Vincent C. Lynch, Contracting Officer, Email vincent.lynch@dot.gov
<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration of the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes. <br />Background:</p>
<p>Estimates of seat belt use have steadily grown over the past 30 years with the most recent national estimate of seat belt use at approximately 85% (NHTSA, 2010) . Seat belt restraints are the most effective injury prevention tool available in motor vehicles and recent estimates show that proper seat belt use reduced the risk of death by 45% for front seat drivers and passengers in motor vehicle crashes (NHTSA, 2011) . Understanding the factors that contribute to inconsistent, improper, and infrequent seat belt use is essential to the development of programs aimed at promoting an increased level of seat belt use (Hedlund et al., 2004) . Previous research has been limited to observation (e.g., National Occupant Protection Use Survey) and self-report techniques (e.g., Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey). Naturalistic studies of driving behavior, however, provide a unique opportunity to observe seat belt use longitudinally, at the individual level, and objectively. In 2003-2004, a naturalistic driving study was conducted which collected video and driving metrics for each trip taken by over 100 drivers (known as the 100-car study) in a 12 month period (Dingus et al., 2006) . A recent analysis of this data showed that likelihood of seat belt use by occasional users (defined as those who wore a belt 40 - 85% of the trips recorded) on a given trip increased with the average speed during a trip and, to a lesser degree, distance traveled (Reagan, McClafferty, Berlin, &amp; Hankey, 2013) . However, due to the small sample size (n = 28 occasional users) and geographic location of the study (Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C.) interpretation and generalization of these findings are limited. Thus, a larger and broader sample is desirable to further investigate this issue and confirm these findings so that they may be translated to the development of programs and educational materials for the purpose of increasing seat belt use.</p>
<p>At present, the largest, most comprehensive naturalistic driving study to date, the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2), is underway (data collection to end fall 2013). Data is being collected at 6 different sites across the United States (Florida, Washington, New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina) so that varying geographic locations, both urban and rural roads, climate variation, and regional differences in transportation practices are represented. The data set is expected to contain approximately 3,900-driver years from participants ranging from 16 to 80 years of age (even split of gender across age ranges). The data collection is expected to yield a total of 2.5 million trip files. A single trip is measured starting when the ignition is turned on until it is turned off. Data recorded for each trip include minimum and maximum vehicle speed, distance of trip, video footage of driving environment and vehicle interior, and forward radar. Data from the naturalistic driving study can be linked with the roadway information database which contains information about the roadway environment. Finally, data may be linked with individual data regarding the drivers (including medical history, current medications, outcomes of sensation seeking and other assessments). Additional information regarding the project is available at the following sites:</p>
<p>http://www.trb.org/StrategicHighwayResearchProgram2SHRP2/Blank2.aspx</p>
<p>www.shrp2nds.us</p>
<p>The SHRP 2 project will yield a large dataset which can be used to evaluate the role of driver behavior and performance in traffic safety. This RFP is for a proposed study that will employ this dataset to expand upon (i.e., inclusion of a larger set of possible covariates and predictor variables) and validate the previous findings regarding occasional seat belt users.</p>
<p>To address the objectives of this project, NHTSA, with the contributions of the Contractor, will decide upon the predictor variables and covariates to be studied including but not limited to distance traveled, average and maximum speed during trip, weather conditions, roadway type, and time of day. The contractor shall extract these variables of interest from the SHRP 2 database and organize a data file accompanied by a coding manual.</p>
<p>The basic tasks required for the completion of this project are described below. Contractors are strongly encouraged to discuss fully in their proposal each of the tasks described in this solicitation. Contractors should do much more than just repeat what is presented in the RFP. Contractors should provide the reasoning for their proposed approach, using as much detail as possible regarding the specific data collection strategies and analyses that would be used, and the type of meaningful information that would result.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>NHTSA's objective is to 1) identify the impact of factors, including but not limited to distance traveled, average and maximum speed during trip, weather conditions, roadway type, and time of day, on seat belt use in occasional users and 2) To identify individual differences, including but not limited to demographics, which differentiate between user groups.</p>

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Correct Child Restraint System Installation
<SOLNBR>DTNH22-14-R-00028
<CONTACT>Melissa R. Tyson, Email melissa.tyson@dot.gov - Vincent C. Lynch, Contracting Officer, Email vincent.lynch@dot.gov
<DESC><p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration of the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>In 2008, a NHTSA study showed that the rate of use of child restraint systems increased from the previous year (81 percent to 86 percent) and that fewer children were unrestrained as compared to the prior year (56 percent to 49 percent) . However, studies have estimated rates of improper installation of child safety seats to be in the range of 70-80 percent. A more recent NHTSA study, the National Child Restraint Use Special Study conducted in 2011, observed and interviewed a nationally representative sample (n = 4,167) of drivers with child passengers regarding child passenger safety . The results revealed five common mistakes (1. wrong harness slot used, 2. improper harness retainer/chest clip position, 3. loose CRS installation, 4. loose harness straps, and 5. improper lap belt placement) regarding child safety seats and a more thorough analysis is ongoing. These errors can be categorized as improper installation of the CRS to the vehicle or, improper securement of the child in the CRS. Additionally, researchers have shown that parents and other caregivers make errors in choosing the right seat for their child. Successfully communicating and emphasizing the importance of these three basic principles is the catalyst for this project.</p>
<p>A significant barrier to enhancing proper CPS installation and use is the degree of overconfidence demonstrated by parents and other caregivers. Specifically, research shows a tendency for the degree of accuracy in installation to be overestimated by parents and other caregivers thus making it unlikely that they will seek out a resource such as a safety check station. A recent study by Mirman, et al., 2013, explored the relationship between CRS installation accuracy (CRS is installed properly), security (CRS is securely attached to the vehicle), caregiver confidence, and caregiver's perceptions of ease of use. Caregivers (n = 75) experienced with CRS installation were observed performing an installation in their own vehicle (one participant used a provided, unfamiliar vehicle). Security of the CRS was measured using lateral and forward movement (movement greater than 1 inch was considered insecure). Participants also rated ease of use, confidence, provided estimates of crash and injury likelihood, and which, if any, sources of CRS installation information they had consulted (e.g., brochures, safety check station, family/friends). The results showed that participants overestimated their own accuracy and security in installation and that perceived ease of use was positively associated with confidence ratings whereas observed accuracy and security were unrelated to confidence ratings. Eighty-nine percent of the participants installed the CRS inaccurately and/or insecurely. Of those participants, 30 percent reported being confident that the CRS was installed correctly. The results suggest that caregivers may not be aware of the errors made during installation thus making it difficult to correct the behavior. A major limitation of this study, however, is that only experienced users were included and used an unfamiliar CRS in their own vehicle (one participant used a provided, unfamiliar vehicle). This makes it difficult to determine the generalizability to real-world use or the role of familiarity in accuracy. Also, it is unclear whether caregivers recognize risk associated with inaccurate CRS installation as this aspect of crash and injury risk has not been assessed.</p>
<p>Errors in CRS installation have been well documented. The causes of these errors, however, are speculative. This study seeks to explore why errors occur and what factors (e.g., compatibility between CRS and vehicle, instructions) contribute to proper installation. The purpose of this project is to evaluate installation performance and caregiver confidence in both experienced and novice CRS users and determine what factors contribute to errors (quantity and type). NHTSA is interested in reducing the number of errors made in CRS installation and the results of this study will provide insight into the cause of observed errors which can then be transitioned to methods aimed at removing those causal contributors.</p>
<p>The basic tasks required for the completion of this project are described below. Contractors are strongly encouraged to discuss fully in their proposal each of the tasks described in this solicitation. Contractors should do much more than just repeat what is presented in the RFP. Contractors should provide the reasoning for their proposed approach, using as much detail as possible regarding the specific data collection strategies that would be used, and the type of meaningful information that would result.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>NHTSA's objective is to 1) identify CRS installation errors (3 categories: errors in CRS choice for child height/weight/age; errors in installation of the CRS to the vehicle, errors in securing the child in the CRS) in novice and experienced users, 2) observe and evaluate the causal role of factors (including but not limited to instructions, vehicle type, CRS and vehicle compatibility, and CRS type) that contribute to errors (quantity and type), 3) evaluate the relationships between individual differences, confidence in installation performance, observed errors, and CRS familiarity, and 4) evaluate the risk level perceived with inaccurate CRS installations by caregivers.</p>

<SUBJECT>Instrumented Roadways for Speed-related Problems v2.0
<SOLNBR>DTNH22-14-R-00774
<CONTACT>Melissa R. Tyson, Email melissa.tyson@dot.gov - Vincent C. Lynch, Contracting Officer, Email vincent.lynch@dot.gov
<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Speeding-related crashes continue to be a serious problem. For over a decade, there has been little change in the proportion of speeding-related fatal crashes. In 2011, nearly one-third (30%) of all fatal crashes had speeding as a contributing factor, the same percentage as in 1996. Speeding is a complicated behavior that varies by driver and situation. Speeding is also common behavior, with most drivers reporting they drive over the speed limit at least some of the time. In NHTSA's 2011 National Survey of Speeding Attitudes and Behaviors, when asked how often they drove 10 or 15 miles per hour over the posted speed limit, over half of the respondents (52%) reported having driven 15 mph over the speed limit on multi-lane divided highways, over one-third (36%) reported having driven 15 mph over the posted speed limit on two-lane roads, and 36% also reported having driven 10 mph over the posted limit on neighborhood or residential streets. Nine percent of those surveyed reported having been stopped by the police for speeding in the previous year, and 8% reported receiving a speeding ticket through the mail for a violation recorded by a speed camera. Given the widespread occurrence of speeding and the high toll in injuries and lives lost in speed-related crashes (9,944 fatalities in 2011), as well as the high economic costs of speed-related crashes (estimated at $40.4 billion per year), this is a safety issue that demands a great deal of attention.</p>
<p>While law enforcement is attentive to speed enforcement in most places around the country, diminishing resources and competing priorities can negatively impact their ability to effectively and efficiently deal with speed management. Data-driven approaches to resource management are becoming increasingly common and an emphasis on using crash data to determine when and where to direct traffic safety efforts, rather than focusing on quantity of citations, is becoming increasingly accepted practice in law enforcement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation's 2013 Speed Management Strategic Initiative states that "the effective and efficient collection, analysis, and dissemination of high quality data is the foundation upon which all traffic safety efforts related to speed and speed management must be built." For these efforts to be most effective, what is needed is a tool to help law enforcement anticipate the level of effort necessary to expect positive changes in traffic speeds and crash frequency. This project will examine the use of continuous roadway data in normal speed management and speed enforcement at a selected test site. It will also link crash records with collected traffic data on speeds and traffic density. The results of this effort will provide the basis for the development of an implementation guide to aid law enforcement officials and program planners in management of speed enforcement, with an emphasis on achieving results in crash reduction. Combined with localized earned media efforts, this should provide law enforcement with a realistic tool that will help them to focus and manage limited resources to affect road safety improvement and speeding related crashes.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This project is a naturalistic study of speed management program efforts to reduce speeding-related safety problems in a medium sized city or county with a dedicated traffic law enforcement division. Traffic measurement devices will be deployed to collect traffic speed data on various road types in the participating jurisdiction, including road sections with speeding-related problems. Data will be collected on both the instrumented roadway sections and traffic enforcement activities throughout the project. After a 90-day period of baseline data collection period, the data will be shared in real time with the enforcement agency to use in their speed management efforts. These speed management efforts will be determined by the participating jurisdiction. The Contractor shall observe and collect data in order to evaluate how the data is used to deploy resources and address the speeding-related problems in the jurisdiction for one year. After completion of the naturalistic observation study of the speed management program, an optional task may be exercised to evaluated specific speeding countermeasures (details to be determined by NHTSA in agreement with the Contractor and participating jurisdiction).</p>
<p>This project will select and work with a site with a speeding-related crash problem that is interested in making a concerted effort to reduce their speeding-related traffic safety problem. The site selected must be a medium sized jurisdiction (city or county with an approximate population of 150,000 to 500,000) with a dedicated traffic division and an analyst available to handle traffic data and statistical reports for local law enforcement. The Contractor shall work with the selected site to instrument targeted roadway sections with speed collection devices, collect roadway, enforcement, crash, and earned media data, and provide the data to the research team and NHTSA. The Contractor shall also provide this data to the site's law enforcement agency for use in their speed management efforts on the instrumented roadways. The jurisdiction will then use the data to assist them as they carry out traffic enforcement according to their own policies and decisions. The Contractor shall collect data and observe traffic enforcement activities and conduct an independent analysis of traffic speeds and enforcement levels on the targeted roadways to examine the relationship of speeding, traffic volume and crashes at those sites and to ascertain optimal levels of enforcement for reducing speeding and speeding-related crashes for those locations.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Anite Channel Emulator Upgrade
<SOLNBR>NB772010-14-02514
<RESPDATE>050914
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Don Graham, Contracting Officer, Phone 3019758567, Email Donald.Graham@NIST.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Anite Telecoms of Schaumburg, Illinois for the purchase of a Propsim channel emulator under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p><br />NIST has a requirement for an Anite Propsim F32 channel emulator to serve as a direct replacement of its existing Propsim F8 MIMO radio frequency channel emulator. Within the scope of ANTD's spectrum sharing program, ANTD's requirements have changed to include larger test configurations consisting of 11 fully connected nodes or 8 smaller networks of 4X4 nodes. Therefore, it is now necessary to upgrade the unit that ANTD currently owns (EB Demo Unit Propsim F8 MIMO Radio Frequency Channel Emulator) to the Anite unit Propsim F32 channel emulator with 16 independent AWGN channels.</p>
<p>NIST has invested 1.5 years in training its ANTD personnel, extending the models in the emulator's library, and in developing modules and plug ins for use with its existing Anite channel emulator within the wireless programmable testbed. These NIST-developed models, modules, and plug ins would be unusable with a channel emulator from any other manufacturer. The financial cost of retraining the ANTD personnel and developing an entirely new set of modular plug ins for a channel emulator from another manufacturer would be significant, and&nbsp;would not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Anite is the only contractor that can provide the required Propsim F32 channel emulator. The technology is proprietary, and there are no authorized distributors. Therefore, Anite is uniquely qualified to provide the Propsim F32 channel emulator.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule. This requirement is expected to be awarded in August, 2014.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on May 9, 2014. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

The resulting contract(s) will be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), with pre-established fixed contract prices.     

This procurement is set aside as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) with the intent to award three to five FFP multiple award service contracts under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The small business size standard is $14.0 million.

The minimum guarantee applies to the 60 month term of the contract(s). FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend the Services will be incorporated in the resulting contracts.  The aggregate value of all task orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $40,000,000.  Fair opportunity will be provided for all resulting task orders in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).

The services to be acquired include habitat enhancement services to perform needed project site preparation, restoration, revegetation, exotic plant control, erosion control, grading, earth moving, contouring, stabilization, native planting and seeding, site maintenance, weed abatement, biomonitoring, signage, fence installation, and other associated tasks in Arizona, California, and Nevada.
 Services may be performed in sensitive habitats that are subject to environmental regulations such as, but not limited to, the Endangered Species Act and/or Clean Water Act.

<DESC>This is a Presolicitation Notice for COMNAVMETOCCOMs requirement for Infrastructure Support Services and Information Assurance Support Services.
The Contractor shall support the COMNAVMETOCCOM enterprise by conducting special studies; preparing operational concepts; analyzing risk; and developing algorithms, processes, and recommendations on relevant subjects to collect, process, manage, and transmit Meteorology, Oceanographic data, and Geospatial Information & Services (GI&S). The Contractor shall also provide technical support and systems engineering to facilitate migration of associated systems, within the guidelines of the DoD Corporate Information Management initiative to achieve interoperability and to establish the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management compliant processing architecture.
 The Contractor shall support government personnel in ensuring that software design, development, and maintenance activities comply with federal, DoD, DON, and COMNAVMETOCCOM policies including, but not limited to, Information Assurance and net centricity. 

Deliverables must comply with all applicable DoD security configuration or implementation guides. This includes, but is not limited to DISA Secure Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). Reference: DODI 8500.2, IA Control: ECSC-1, Subject: Security Configuration Compliance, Requirement: For Enclaves and AIS applications, all DoD security configuration or implementation guides have been applied.

The contractor shall provide technical support for the following Information Technology Programs:

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) is an ACAT IA Program Of Record (PoR), which now includes all former IT Programs within the NMOC Enterprise, including POPS-Monterey (formerly just POPS), Oceanographic Information System (OIS), Meteorology and Oceanography Systems (METOCSYS), the Precise Time and Astrometry  (PTA) Systems work at the Naval Observatory, and all other IT work.
  

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) for Oceanography (Oceans) is an operational information system within DOD providing automated support for oceanographic data collection, processing, analysis, product generation, and distribution.  POPS - Oceans products provide critical direct operational support to all mission areas of the fleet and other forces that operate on, under, over, or near the worlds oceans. Formerly known as the Oceanographic Information System (OIS), POPS-Oceans is the primary information technology domain at NAVOCEANO and is the enabler for oceanographic information and predictions in support of Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Mine Warfare (MIW), and submarine/ship navigation.
 The OIS program involves automated Information Resource / Information Management support for multi-disciplinary ocean surveys, assigned scientific and technical projects, and oceanographic product generation and distribution at NAVOCEANO and its subordinate commands, the Naval Ice Center (NAVICECEN) and Fleet Survey Team (FST). Also at NAVOCEANO is the Surf Eagle (SE) program tasked to produce and disseminate oceanographic/littoral and riverine environmental intelligence, analysis, and special products primarily in support of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met), located at FLENUMMETOCCEN at Monterey, CA provides the key production engine enabling global METOC support of the fleet.
 POPS-Met operates within a 24/7 reach back operations center supporting global fleet operations with weather and ocean prediction products and war fighting applications that are critical to fleet safety and war fighting effectiveness. POPS-Met provides the technology and infrastructure to sustain global operations ashore and afloat by providing timely, relevant, 24/7 METOC data and products to the fleet, Department of Defense, joint, allied, and coalition warfighters at all classification levels. POPS-Met acquires and sustains the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) environments to provide most of the assured METOC forecast products and services for Tier 1 of the Battlespace on Demand, which originate directly from the METOC models, satellite processing software, and applications.
 Tier 1 also provides input to many of the Battlespace on Demand Tier 2 and Tier 3 Products. Ongoing technology refreshment is required to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly in response to greater emphasis on preparation for and response to regional conflicts, and the greater data volume from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and future remotely sensed environmental data sources. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support. Together, these enhancements will provide the Fleet with more accurate and responsive environmental support across all three Tiers of Battlespace on Demand.
 POPS-Met supports DoDs principle operational processing center for numerical meteorology and oceanography (METOC) analysis and prediction.

The combined programs maintain COMNAVMETOCCOM, USNAVOBSY, FLENUMMETOCCEN,NAVOCEANO, NAVICECEN, FST, NAVOCEANOPSCOM, and the echelon IV activities scientific
Information Technology (IT) systems in support of established METOC requirements and coordinates the modernization of these assets to ensure efficient operations and the infusion of new technology.

Work to be performed will be divided into two Functional Areas: Functional Area # 1-Infrastructure
Support, IT System Administration, Communications, Cross Domain Solutions (CDS), and Functional Area # 2-Information Assurance under Section C.6 of the PWS.

<DESC>Posted Date:  April 25, 2014 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund RCRA Procurement Operations Division (3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460 
Response Date: May 2, 2014 
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research  and Development  and  EPA's  National Exposure Research Lab (NERL) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to AB SCIEX, LLC to purchase a twelve month service contract for the AB SCIEX API 3000 MS/MS System.
This instrument is a top priority for NERL because it supports collaborative research projects within NERL and with colleagues at NHEERL, NRMRL, Regional and Program Offices, and at North Carolina State University.  It is imperative that the instrument be maintained with its original sensitivity and specificity to meet quality assurance objectives for these projects.  Moreover, given the large number of samples assigned to this instrument, it is very important that it be operated with minimal down time.  This service contract will assure that this system will be operational with maximum sensitivity and that service and replacement parts will be immediately available should they be required.
AB SCIEX is best positioned to provide this service as they are the only company having both the parts and experience available to meet this need in a rapid manner.  The AB SCIEX proprietary diagnostic program is the most suitable and efficient way of quickly resolving and optimizing the instrument performance.  Moreover, as the company that designed and built this instrument, AB SCIEX will guarantee access to authorized factory parts, have a unique ability to diagnose and fix known or recurrent problems, offer and recommend engineering upgrades, and provide valuable advice concerning operational parameters and instrument settings.

<p>The DOC/OSY has spent considerable money over the past ten (10) years with CENTECH on maintenance and enhancements to the current Security Manager Enterprise System, making it a comprehensive and robust security tool customized, by CENTECH, to the DOC/OSY's unique needs. Award to CENTECH is necessary so that the DOC/OSY can: 1) Receive the benefits of the substantial time, effort and money already invested in the Security Manager Enterprise System; and, 2) Avoid substantial duplication of costs to the Security Manager Program.</p>
<p>X. CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>The determination by the government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) is based upon market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research, specifically the review and evaluation of responses received to the sources sought notice disseminated through Federal Business Opportunities on March 28, 2014. The results of the market research concluded that there are no other companies with the capability of providing Security Manager Enterprise System Maintenance. <br /><br />The intended acquisition is hereby conducted under the authority of the FAR 6.302-1 because only one responsible source (contractor-CENTECH) will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, no other supplies or services from another contractor will satisfy agency requirements. Consideration of contractors will be restricted because only one source, CENTECH, is capable of responding and meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique and specialized nature of the work. The software being acquired was developed by CENTECH and is proprietary to the Company. Further, CENTECH, has not approved any reseller(s) of its proprietary software for either the acquisition of the software or for purposes performing any maintenance in connection with that proprietary software. Thus, CENTECH Proprietary Security Manager Enterprise System Annual License Maintenance is the only service which possesses the elements and features essential to meet the Government's requirements.<br /><br />XI. CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive bids, quotes or proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the Government's requirements and include: 1) all pertinent technical; 2) price information, i.e. unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs; 3) the delivery period after contract award, if applicable; 4) the prompt payment discount terms; 5) the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin); 6) the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number {Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; 7) the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and, 8) the certification of business size. All interested parties must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The responses received, if any, will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether the Government continues to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; All responses must reference the identifier code as follows: DOC-CAS--SOLESOURCE--00173. All responses must be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist, Mario Gray, using the e-mail address as follows: MGray@doc.gov, and, by the closing date and time of this notice. Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately 15 days after the release of this announcement. The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is soliciting proposals on an unrestricted basis for Technical & Programmatic Support Services (TPSS) under solicitation W912DY-12-R-0024.  In order to accomplish this mission, CEHNC proposes to award multiple unrestricted, with a small business set-aside, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Contracts will be for a 1-year base ordering period with four possible 1-year option periods.  The estimated maximum contract capacity is $150,000,000.00 over a period of five years (if the options are exercised) for this acquisition.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this acquisition is primarily for the continuous technical and programmatic service and support to a worldwide Federal client base that relies on both Utility Monitoring and Control Systems (UMCS) and Electronic Security Systems (ESS). The objective of the proposed acquisition is to provide performance based contracts under the ESS and UMCS programs to ensure that required services can be accomplished in a timely and cost effective manner. The UMCS Program provides expertise to survey, procure, install, test, operate, and maintain utility monitoring and control systems and other electronic systems such as fire alarms, heating, ventilation, air- conditioning, and supervisory control and data acquisition. The ESS Program provides similar expertise to survey, procure, install, test, operate, and maintain electronic security systems. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Center (CEHNC) anticipates requirements for technical and programmatic support services in order to successfully execute the UMCS and ESS programs. The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to provide restoration / adjustment services (where Architect-Engineer services are not required) for building systems. The support services include restoring / adjusting building systems in order to bring a facility back into compliance with its original design.  Restoration / adjustment may include minor repairs and alterations, as well as purchase of materials to support those minor repairs.  Services may include information assurance technical support. TPSS relating to real property (such as utility monitoring and control systems, for example) may include:   <br>  <br> * Review of and/or execution of commissioning plans <br> * Systems monitoring and operation <br> * Systems administration <br> * Developing budgetary Rough Orders of Magnitude (ROM) estimates <br> * Training <br> * On-site equipment data collection and compilation <br> * Other related technical and programmatic support provided that Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are not required. <br>  <br> Additionally, TPSS relating to personal property (such as ESS, UMCS, related communication infrastructure for example) may also include:   <br>  <br> * On-site inspection support <br> * Site visits, investigations, master planning, and surveys <br> * Systems evaluations <br> * Project management support <br> * Security assessments <br> * Technical reviews (may include review of work prepared or performed by Other Government Contractors (OGCs)) <br> * Other related technical and programmatic support provided that Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are not required. <br>  <br> Contractually, the MATOCs will predominantly be services contracts, but incidental technical solutions, including procurement and installation of minor portions of UMCS or ESS systems and/or sub-systems (i.e. controllers, sensors, actuators, cameras, card readers, network switches, etc.) may be required to enable the execution of some support services. The Technical and Programmatic Support Services contract will require the Contractor to have the capability to respond to multiple requests for work at diverse locations. The large majority of the work is estimated to take place in the Continental United States (CONUS), to include the Alaska, Hawaii, other U.S. Territories and possessions. The work in foreign countries equates to 5% or less of the overall scope, including the anticipated foreign locations of Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. The North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services. This acquisition may require the handling and generation of classified information. Personnel shall be able to obtain necessary security clearances and visas/passports. <br>  <br> The Government contemplates awarding a minimum of four (4) ID/IQ MATOCs with a minimum of two awards going to small businesses, however it reserves the right to award more, less, or none at all.  The resultant contracts will be a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) (IDIQ) type contract(s) pursuant to FAR 16.504. The task orders under the proposed MATOC will utilize Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M) line items. It is anticipated that approximately 90 percent of the task order efforts will be FFP.  <br>  <br> This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.  Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available.  Other methods of requesting a package will not be honored.  Offerors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM)) at www.sam.gov prior to submission of proposals.  The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov, and will be available to prospective offerors without charge.  Firms can search for the solicitation by solicitation number, W912DY-12-R-0024. It is the offeror's responsibility to check the Internet address provided as necessary for any posted changes to this solicitation and all amendments. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. <br>  <br> The anticipated evaluation factors for this acquisition are listed below:  <br>  <br> FACTOR 1:  TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE  <br>  <br> FACTOR 2: MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND CORPORATE PROGRAMS <br>  <br> FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE <br>  <br> FACTOR 4: SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION <br>  <br> FACTOR 5: PRICE <br>  <br> Detailed information in reference to the above factors will be provided in the associated RFP. <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Raven Nall, Contract Specialist: Raven.A.Nall@usace.army.mil

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT  Computerized Environmental Control Systems at Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Keystone, SD This Sources Sought for the National Park Service (NPS), Mount Rushmore National Monument (MORU), is for the purpose of conducting market research to determine interest and capability in upgrading the existing HVAC/Electrical control system.  This announcement is not a solicitation for proposals, nor are proposals accepted at this time. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on FedConnect (www.FedConnect.net) and Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov). Any cost associated with providing a response to this sources sought, shall be the responsibility of the firm. The Contracting Officer shall use the information received to aid in determining an acquisition strategy. All interested firms must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey/sources sought. Project Description:  Update the existing HVAC/Electrical controls system for various Park buildings with new, web-based panels and software which would reside on the Park Services internal network.  The new software should be both WEB based and client/server based and able to interface with existing control panels seamlessly with no added black box devices or third party devices. It should also support the current industry standard protocols like MODBUS, BacNet, LonWorks, ect., as well as future industry standards. The new software should allow multiple users on any networked computers to monitor and manipulate set points for the control system. The web portion of the software should at a minimum support monitoring and alarm notification.  The software should support unique user accounts and passwords, preferably through Microsoft Active Domain user accounts, and be granular enough to place different restrictions on different users. The software should also support the use of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. The software should support redundancy, so in the event of a server/workstation loss another server/workstation can continue monitoring all devices. Any changes within the software should be replicated seamlessly to the redundant server/workstation. The software should support internal scripting if the need arises for more complex tasks as well as the ability to export data to external text files, databases, ect. Park personnel should have the capability to access the system from outside of the Park Service network through VPN access. Vendor support can be onsite or through the WEB using products authorized by the NPS like Webex, GoToMeeting, ect. In addition the Park requires the following; &#61656;	Installation of Variable Speed Frequency Drives to control air handlers with WEB based software. &#61656;	Upgrade/replace space sensors controlling environmental temperatures.  &#61656;	Replace existing Pneumatic valves with DC Controlled valve/actuators. &#61656;	Verification of all control sequences of controlled devices.  Air Balance Law Enforcement Wing and Visitor Center. Check and adjust all occupied and unoccupied times of air handling units.  Night/Day and Weekend setbacks.  Put in place an outdoor air reset schedule for control of the boiler hot water supply temperature and damper positions of air handlers. &#61656;	WEB based software shall control lighting circuits, currently controlled by time clocks, with existing control panels where applicable.  Add controls or monitor existing controls at the water plant which would allow remote monitoring and manipulation of system.





The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334512, Computerized Environmental Control Systems for Buildings and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.  Interested firms must submit the following information: 1.	Name of firm 2.	Point of contact 3.	 Address 4.	Phone number 5.	Email address 6.	DUNS Number 7.	Size status, small business type, SBA certifications 8.	Capability statement- Include a summary of recent and relevant experience which would demonstrate that the contractor has the capability and resources to provide this type of service.
All responses must be submitted via email not later than 4:00 PM MST, May 2, 2014.  Email address:   chris_esper@nps.gov.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541380- Testing Laboratories, for an upcoming requirement for a Geologic Carbon Sequestration Project that will: conduct focused, more detailed geological studies and assessments of selected basins with high potential for CO2 sequestration; carry out geologic studies of natural and anthropogenic CO2 storage sites; develop a methodology and conduct assessments of enhanced oil and gas recovery (EOR and EGR) associated with CO2 injection; and develop a methodology and assessment of unconventional CO2 storage reservoirs (such as coal and shale beds) and evaluate their sequestration potential.  The USGS Eastern Energy Resources Science Center (EERSC) has an ongoing requirement for analysis of the composition of the gas and analysis of the stable carbon isotopic composition and stable hydrogen isotopic composition. The exact number of samples varies from year to year, and largely depends on sample accessibility during field campaigns in remote regions and will be determined by quantities, funding, period of performance, and any other variables in separate task orders. Generally, we anticipate collecting approximately 10-30 for analysis.  Interested vendors must be capable of providing all capabilities.
Technical Requirements All chemical analysis should be based on standards accurate to within 2% and preformed by experienced chemists on well-maintained and calibrated equipment.  Isotopic ratios measured by mass spectrometry are to be based on standards that are accurate to within 0.1 per mil for carbon, 0.3 per mil for nitrogen, and 5 per mil for hydrogen. QUALITY OF DATA Chemical analyses are to be performed by gas chromatography for molecular concentrations of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, n-pentane, iso-pentane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, argon, oxygen and nitrogen. Isotopic compositions of individual components are to be determined by mass spectrometry as follows: carbon isotopic of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, n-pentane and carbon dioxide; hydrogen isotopic composition of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, and n-pentane; nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrogen.  The analytical laboratory will supply stainless steel sample cylinders and DOT approved shipping containers. Some samples may be shipped to the analytical laboratory in government-owned stainless steel cylinders.

<CONTACT>John Penley, Acquisition Lead, Phone 2564503356, Email john.penley@mda.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to post a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This RFI is for informational planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.

The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) mission is to develop and deploy a layered, ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attacks of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) Program Office is developing a future acquisition strategy for the Agencys Acquisition, Engineering, and Support Services with the emphasis on identifying an acquisition strategy that provides the best value to the Agency in terms of technical capability coupled with improved costs. The current Acquisition, Engineering, and Support services contract, commonly referred to as MiDAESS, is an ID/IQ contract grouped in the following functional capability groups (FCGs): (1) Quality, Safety, and Mission Assurance Support, (2) Acquisition Support, (3) Engineering Support, (4) Infrastructure and Deployment Support, (5) Agency Operations Support, (6) Security and Intelligence Support, and (7) Agency Advisory Analytical Support (Note: the attached table provides a detailed breakout of existing MiDAESS requirements by FCG, functional organization, and task order).

This RFI is issued to solicit input from industry on any changes (ranging from minor "tweaks" to wholesale re-alignments) in the alignment of scopes of work that would benefit both industry and the Agency through increased competition, lower costs, and improved support. This is not a request for inputs on the type of contract or contracts to be awarded but instead is a focused effort to identify work groupings for improvements in competition. The Government is interested in industrys recommendations in changes to work scope or groupings that would provide a better basis for industry to develop and compete for contract and/or task order awards.

Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this request for information will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Missile Defense Agency will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future acquisition.

The Missile Defense Agency is requesting information via e-mail with Windows compatible email
attachment on or before May 6, 2014 to MIDAESS2014@mda.mil. Responses are limited
to no more than 3 pages, 8-1/2 x 11; use 12 inch font.

Questions concerning this RFI should be addressed to Ms. Lynn Washburn, Competition
Advocate, at Lynne.Washburn@mda.mil. Responses must be sent to MIDAESS2014@mda.mil
in order to be considered.

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Division intends to award on a sole source basis with Ace Info Solutions, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Part 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D) as well as 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), to increase the ceiling by $140,000.00 for the National Weather Service (NWS) NLETS telecommunication system interface. Ace Info Solutions, Inc. is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), which states "The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order." The government's surge in IT security requirements exhausted infrastructure ceiling sooner than anticipated. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to michael.iszard@noaa.gov by May 25, 2014

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the standardization of Safety Lancets, Pediatric. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MW-1205-41_Safety_Lancets_Pediatric are eligible for participation. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Safety Lancets, Pediatric products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MW-1205-41_Safety_Lancets_Pediatric. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is June 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL MW-1205-41_Safety_Lancets_Pediatric, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Safety Lancets, Pediatric.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets, Pediatric. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $402,275.00 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MW-1205-41_Safety_Lancets_Pediatric who are interested in participating in the Standardization</strong> Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below. In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO West via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Safety Lancets, Pediatric pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification.<strong> Vendors not currently on the QSL for Safety Lancets, Pediatric will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO MW-1205-41_Safety_Lancets_Pediatric.</strong> Vendor must provide responses to the Sources Sought Notification via the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions /&nbsp;Annual Usage in Units <br />Safety Lancet 1.0MMD x 2.5MM&nbsp; /179350</p>
<p>2. Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions <br />Safety Lancet 0.65MM X 1.40MM <br />Safety Lancet 0.85MM x 1.75MM <br />Safety Lancet 2.0MM x 3.0MM <br />Safety Lancet 2.0MM x 1.5MM <br />Safety Lancet 2.5MM-3.0MM x 1.0MM - 1.25MM</p>
<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

<DESC>As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings

Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing

To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 3 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government; technical, past performance and price considered. Past performance is of greater importance than technical and when combined, technical and past performance are of greater importance than price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
BASIS OF AWARD:  The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors and is deemed to be the best value to the Government. 
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer deemed to be the most advantageous to the Government.  Competing offeror's technical approach and past performance will be evaluated as significantly more important than price considerations, with past performance being more important than technical. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 

A.	Provide a detailed narrative as to how the offeror plans to meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement including how the offeror plans to meet requirements outlined in Attachments A & B. Included in this narrative must be the offeror's Health and Safety Plan (HASP).
Technical explanations will receive a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable based on whether or not they address all aspects of the PWS and attachments in a satisfactory manner.

B.	Past Performance Assessment: 
1) Past Performance, the offeror shall provide a minimum of 2 (maximum 3) relevant past performance references which shall include the following:
Contact name, number, and email, contract reference #, date(s) of performance, dollar amount of contract.
Information obtained from provided references through phone/email communication as well as questionnaires will be used to create a confidence rating for each offeror based on the relevance and quality of the past performance. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the relevancy requirement will be excluded from evaluation. 
2) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 
3) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NEUTRAL: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.
4) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe will be excluded from evaluation. 
5) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
Based on the quality and relevancy of each offeror's past performance, a confidence rating from the following table will be assigned:
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Offeror to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, Offeror must submit a completed copy of this provision with its proposal for the proposal to be considered. See https://orca.bpn.gov/ for online submittal);

The following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated in full text:
52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.
(End of Clause)
52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)
  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or Native as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:
(i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe.

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:
(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation;
(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
(b) General.
(1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers are solicited only from Indian economic enterprises.
(2) BIA will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises.
(3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause.

(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);

(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the Online Representatives and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 1 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>The Government reserves the right to vary quantities by +/- 30% due to operational requirements and to make multiple awards to meet said requirements. The Government also reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. The Government will not be charged for mission changes. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. The contractor's Past Performance will be reviewed. Companies that have negative past performance shall not be awarded the contract. The price will be determined fair and reasonable IAW Far Part 13.106. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product <br />Listed Countries of Origin</p>

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [ ] Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that-</p>
<p>(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

IPP allows vendors to receive their remittance information from their financial institution. Effective October 31, 2008, IPP replaced the PAID system. Former PAID users have been automatically migrated to IPP and need to complete the initial provisioning process from the new user ID, temporary password, and web address sent by Treasury. This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.<br />The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download. Payment information will be uploaded to the IPP daily from Treasury systems on the date of payment.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 003 is to extend the closing date for accepting responses, and to add to the Contractor Requirements and Instructions to Offerors on submitting quotations previously stated. If there is ever a conflict between what is previosuly stated to the current amendment, the current amendment will take precedence.<br />This announcement is soliciting quotations for supply and delivery of bulk gases for the Porter Neuroscience Research Center,  Phases 1 &amp;2, bldg 35/35A.<br />The acquisition purpose is to supply building 35/35A Porter with a constant bulk gas supply and a delivery schedule for gases.<br />Background<br /> Gases are a requirement in Porter I and II for the daily scientific research; researchers rely on the gases for ongoing experiments that are conducted throughout time frames ranging from 1 day, to several weeks. It is imperative that there is no interruption in gas supply, as this will adversely affect the Science, (Critical specimens and years of research lost).There are three bulk tanks on the facility, that supply the building with house gases: Carbon Dioxide, Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen feeds an LN2 freezer farm, as well as supplying the building with house Nitrogen. Nitrogen gas is pressurized and used to "float" isolation tables which ensure that there is no adverse consequence from any vibration in the area. In addition, carbogen mixers at the bulk tank area mix and supply the building with house carbogen, a combination of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This mixed gas is essential in experiments examining the function and development of neurons in the brain. <br />Scope<br />The following requirements are essential to the government requirement.  <br />Vendor will accommodate a 6 am or earlier delivery schedule to offset loading dock constraints.<br />Vendor would be required to make at least 2 deliveries per month minimum of all three gases, but a maximum of whatever is needed to continue the uninterrupted flow of gases to the Porter facility.<br />The vendor will monitor all gas levels twice weekly and make recommendations when observed gas levels are low.<br />Vendor can accommodate same day delivery when required. <br />Vendor should have a standard next day delivery policy.  <br />Vendor will submit quotes based on the annual quantities and units of measure listed below, <br />Carbon Dioxide    72000 LB<br />Liquid Nitrogen    144000 CC<br />Liquid Oxygen      14400 CC<br />

Add the following clause to the requirement:
52.216-2  ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT-STANDARD SUPPLIES (JAN 1997)
  (a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for stents and balloons is not in excess of the Contractor's applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term "unit price" excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice.  The term "established price" means a price that-
    (1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and
    (2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.
  (b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.
  (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price.
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective-
      (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or
      (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
    (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.
    (5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.
  (d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled GEOSTATIONARY HOSTED PAYLOAD OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS which was posted on 9 April 2014. <p> This information is a clarification of material that is in the synopsis: <p> 1.	How does this fit together with other Hosted Payload related activities such as HoPS, the HPSIS, and the CII?  Some of the information seems to be overlapping, so we would like to understand where this is focusing. <p> Answer: ARC supports all efforts to develop hosted payloads from HoPS and is in contact with the Air Force.  Often times different portions of the government pursue similar missions at the same time.  These missions may, to a casual observer, appear to be the same but they can have very different mission requirements. ARCs interests are different from the AF as described in this Sources Sought synopsis. <p> 2.	Is there an acquisition timeline/plan for hosted payloads after this sources sought? <p> Answer: There is no acquisition plan at this time.  The purpose of the Sources Sought is to select a partner(s) to propose with in response to competitive solicitations. <p> 3.	Approximately how many hosted payload accommodation opportunities are expected per year? <p> Answer: There are no firm opportunities at present.  However we anticipate no more than 2 opportunities a year. <p> The due date for responses is not extended. <p> Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/ARC Business Opportunities home page is <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21">http://prod.nais.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21 </A>    <p> Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). <p>

<DESC>This Request for Information is amended to inform Industry a formal requirement resulted from this notice. RFQ: AG-6395-S-14-0044, was issued on April 25, 2014, under GSA E-buy, Schedule 70, Category 132 51. For questions related to this notice, please <br />email your questions to Larry D. Nelson, Contracting Officer, at:<br />e-mail:larry.d.nelson@aphis.usda.gov<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources Sought: Certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) systems currently in the market.
<p>Objective: To gather industry information regarding existing CARPOL-related systems and services.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS) is seeking government, industry, and academic input for information related to Web-based systems and services that currently support certification, accreditation, registration, permitting, and other licensing (CARPOL) activities. Specifically, we want to:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify other State and Federal Government agencies, commercial, and academic entities that provide CARPOL services to the public.<br />&bull; Learn about the processes, technology, systems, and services that are being used to support CARPOL activities.<br />&bull; Determine the best practices for delivering CARPOL services.<br />&bull; Determine what functional requirements were used to develop or acquire CARPOL systems.<br />&bull; Determine how CARPOL systems are being funded before and after implementation.<br />&bull; Leverage lessons learned from the development of CARPOL services.<br />&bull; Identify private-sector resources that may provide CARPOL systems or services.<br />&bull; Determine what methods others have used to build their existing infrastructures (e.g., software, hardware, middleware, funding) to support CARPOL-related activities<br />APHIS is organizationally located under USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP). MRP's mission is to facilitate domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and ensure the health and wellbeing of animals and plants. The overarching goals of the USDA MRP agencies are:<br />&bull; Faster delivery of services and products<br />&bull; Improved customer relations<br />&bull; Incorporation of efficiency and innovation into operational solutions<br />&bull; Perpetuation of effective change management</p>
<p>APHIS' mission is threefold:<br />(1) provide leadership in ensuring the health and wellbeing of animals and plants, (2) improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and (3) contribute to the national economy and public health.</p>
<p>In supporting USDA's mission to protect American agriculture and natural resources, APHIS issues CARPOL authorizations of various forms to allow the movement of specifically regulated agricultural commodities into and through the United States.</p>
<p>APHIS currently provides a Web-based system for users to apply for permits, check the status of their permit applications, and view issued permits. The system is integrated with the U.S. Department of Treasury www.pay.gov site to process payments of any fees. Federal import permitting officials use the APHIS system workflow capabilities to review the applications and issue permits. In addition, Federal and State enforcement officials use the APHIS system to verify the validity of import permits. <br />The current system has approximately 22,000 registered users, and processes nearly 33,000 applications and issues 27,000 permits annually. The system users include APHIS import permitting officials; other Federal Government employees; State agriculture officials; and private individuals, universities, and businesses. The system exchanges data with separate systems utilized by other Federal Government agencies that are also involved in the inspection and movement of imported commodities under APHIS' regulatory authority. These other agencies include the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Internally, Plant Inspection Stations and Investigative and Enforcement Services staff use the system to validate permits and exchange data with several IT systems. In addition to the current Web-based system, APHIS has other CARPOL processes that interact with the import permitting process as well as other electronic sources of structured CARPOL data. The USDA and its cooperators issue approximately 550,000 permit-type certificates per year.</p>
<p>APHIS' primary goal is to have one flexible, expandable system that will fulfill its common data needs for CARPOL services and that optimizes user productivity, maximizes data value, and is compliant with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and directives. APHIS seeks to expand and improve its sharing, reporting, and analytical capabilities of CARPOL data and business processes. The foundation of a replacement system or service will be improved business processes identified in a business process assessment and reengineering final product produced by APHIS. An additional goal is to leverage, where possible, current technology and other resources.</p>
<p>All interested market sources are encouraged to respond with the following information:<br />&bull; Title and description of system.<br />&bull; Type of entity the system supports (Federal or State government, academic, commercial, or other).<br />&bull; Name of contractor or other entity supporting the system, including point of contact for additional information (name, address, telephone number, and email) and business status (small, large, or AbilityOne).<br />&bull; Name of customer (owner of the system or data), including point of contact (name, address, telephone number, and email).</p>
<p>Sources responding to this posting are responsible for appropriately marking any information that is proprietary in nature.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Therefore, no proposals will be accepted. No contracts will result from any submission. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received; nor will the Government reimburse participants for information provided.<br />Information requested is strictly voluntary and is for informational purposes only. Responses must be emailed to CARPOL@aphis.usda.gov and include the phrase "CARPOL Solutions" in the subject line. No telephone communication will be accepted. Sources responding to this notice will not be entitled to the results.</p>

<DESC>To facilitate open communication with industry, ACC-RI is offering individual firm feedback meetings regarding K-BOSSS 2.0 on May 9th and May 10th, 2014 (Industry Days).  Industry Days are exclusively for ACC-RI and individual firms.  Although networking amongst Contractors is highly encouraged, there will be no facilities available on Camp Arifjan to facilitate Contractor to Contractor discussions. <br>  <br> The purpose of Industry Days is to allow industry the opportunity to openly communicate with the United States Government (USG) by providing comments and feedback early enough in the procurement process for consideration during the final procurement strategy development.  <br>   <br> Ground Rules for Industry Days: <br>  <br> 1)	Request a meeting time only if your firm has meaningful feedback.  The USG reserves the right to end the meeting if the participants do not adhere to acceptable topics. <br>  <br> 2)	Neither side shall make a presentation during the individual firm feedback meetings.  <br>  <br> 3)	Recording devices are not permitted.   <br>  <br> 4)	No additional information will be provided by the USG that has not already been published or presented.   <br>  <br> 5)	There is no guarantee the USG will implement or react to the concerns, comments or ideas presented at the individual firm feedback meetings. <br>  <br> 6)	The individual firm feedback meetings are not question and answer sessions.  The USG will not be able to provide additional information or immediately answer questions.  However, any questions will be taken and answered through publication on FBO at a future date. <br>  <br> 7)	There will be no negative ramifications for any firm choosing not to participate in Industry Days.  No listing of attendees will be published. <br>  <br> 8)	Firms must be flexible with their schedules on Friday and Saturday.  A final pick up time will be provided to each interested firm by close of business Wednesday, May 7th, 2014. <br>  <br> 9)	Individual firm feedback meetings will be limited to 45 minutes in length. <br>  <br> Acceptable Topics for One-on-One Communications with Industry: <br>  <br>  	Any information about K-BOSSS 2.0 which has already been made accessible to the public or is otherwise being made available to all potential offerors <br>  <br>  	Any lessons learned from historical information about prior contracts that is relevant to K-BOSSS 2.0 <br>  <br>  	Information that describes the federal procurement process as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DFARS, AFARS or other published procurement policy documents <br>  <br>  	Procurement specific information already published such as information contained in the PWS, Sources Sought, Draft RFP <br>  <br> Unacceptable Topics for One-on-One Communications with Industry: <br>  <br>  	Proprietary or confidential business information of contractor(s) or other business entities performing similar ongoing efforts <br>  <br>  	Marketing pitches or contractor capability presentations <br>  <br>  	Privacy Act protected information such as existing contractor employees' personal data <br>  <br>  	Speculation on what the Government might be looking for in the proposals <br>  <br>  	Different technical and management approaches <br>  <br>  	Technical efficiencies <br>  <br>  	Performance of Contractors providing similar requirements who could be potential competitors for the K-BOSSS solicitation, if finalized <br>  <br>  <br> Due to the overwhelming number of industry participants interested in Industry Days, appointments for individual firm feedback meetings will be scheduled for both May 9th and 10th 2014 at Camp Arifjan.  Correspondence will be sent out to each respondent to tentatively confirm a meeting date and time.   <br>  <br> If any firm is willing to participate in Industry Day individual firm feedback meetings at Army Contracting Command - Rock Island instead on May 14, 2014, please respond as soon as possible, but no later than Monday, April 28, 2014 noon CST. <br>  <br> Questions can be addressed to the Contracting Office via email at USARMY.RIA.acc.mbx.kbosss2@mail.mil  <br>  <br> Information presented during the Site Visit and Industry Day is provided for situational awareness only.  The controlling document for purposes of any potential proposal development will be the K-BOSSS 2.0 solicitation, W52P1J-14-R-0001, if finalized and formally issued.  Information presented or discussed during these events will not be considered for evaluation purposes in the event a Request for Proposal is issued. <br>  <br> This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the USG to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the USG for any purpose. <br>  <br>  <br>

Point of Contact for questions is Henry Girolamo at henry.j.girolamo.civ@mail.mil or 508.233-5483.  These updates are reflected below. <br>  <br> ********* <br>  <br> The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, will host a Textile S&T Industry Day on June 24 and 25, 2014 at Lord Community Center located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSSC), Kansas Street, Natick,  MA ,01760-5000.  <br>    <br>  The event will run from 9:00 AM EDT to 3:00 PM EDT each day.  The focus of the event will be on the Poster Booths manned with NSRDEC Textile Subject Matter Experts intended to facilitate focused professional exchanges amongst attendees.  The proposed event is being held in a government facility; involves no travel of DoD personnel or other Army costs; involves employee poster sessions, optional Lab tours and face to face discussions between attending Army, academic and industry representatives.    <br>    <br>  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals. This event is open to all US industry and academia representatives and will present an opportunity to interact with NSRDEC Soldier Textile Technologists.  The purpose of the Textile Industry Day is to describe NSRDEC's textile technology S&T programs and focus areas and its specific/unique expertise, facilities, and capabilities and  to provide a forum to exchange information and ideas on how Academia and Industry might partner with NSRDEC in addressing Army specific textile challenges and to provide information and assistance regarding the mechanisms and tools available for doing business with NSRDEC, including BAA, SBIR, CRADA, and others. This exchange of information will improve academia's and industry's understanding of unique textile related S&T challenges faced by the NSRDEC in fulfilling its mission to maximize the Warrior's survivability, sustainability, mobility, combat effectiveness and quality of life by treating the Soldier as a System.   In turn, this enhanced understanding will allow potential partners to make more informed judgments on whether or how they can participate with the NSRDEC in addressing these S&T needs, and provide an opportunity for face to face exchanges amongst NSRDEC, academic and industry based experts in the Textile S&T community.  <br>    <br>  Some examples of unique NSRDEC textile S&T facing challenges are:  <br>    <br>    *  Next generation shelter/tent skin textiles - reduced weight, nonwovens, flame resistance  <br>    *  Insulating textiles for shelters  <br>    *  Targeted antimicrobial textiles  <br>    *  New and Advanced Closure Systems  <br>    *  Smart Textiles for Parachute applications: sensing, power transport, actuation, service life monitoring, active temperature control for parachutist clothing   <br>    *  Future Textiles for Parachutes: dissolving,  quote mark green quote mark  disposable, reduced bulk/reduced weight, degradation indicating  <br>    <br>  The event consists of discussions and displays from Army attendees/NSRDEC employees and other federal employees working on the installation.  There will be no official travel of Army employees for purposes of attending the event.  Target audience is interested participants from public and private universities, not-for-profits, and commercial businesses interested in the area of textiles.  Due to security protocols for entrance onto the NSSC, the event is open only to US Citizens/resident aliens with Permanent Resident Card as valid identification.  <br>     <br>  There will be a registration process, but no registration fee for attendees.  In order to facilitate entry onto the NSSC, an Unescorted Visitor Request Security form is on the registration WEB site below and needs to be filled out as part of the registration process.  This is required for access to the NSSC.  A brochure describing Textile S&T Posters and unique textile testing laboratories will be sent to registrants prior to the event.  <br>        <br>  Federal Acquisition Regulation Section 35.004 requires agencies to continually search for and develop information on a broad base of the best contractor sources from the scientific and industrial community, (including small business concerns) competent to perform R&D work. The proposed event is one part of NSRDEC's total effort to meet this requirement.  <br>    <br>  The proposed event is S&T mission related meetings directly linked to NSRDEC's regulatory responsibility to identify, encourage and develop the best available sources of S&T capabilities.  In that context it is a mission essential event that enhances and complements NSRDEC operational capabilities and business processes.  <br>    <br>  Both days will comprise identical sessions and will cover textile technology S&T Problem/Need; Approach; Progress; Challenges and disucssions regarding where industry/academia participation is needed.  There will be poster sessions combined with (optional) tours.  Additionally personal meetings can be arranged.  Both days have the same layout.  Although the scope of the topics under these focus areas will be limited, the broader intent of Industry Day is to facilitate communication of textile science and technology needs and discussions on potential provider solutions.     <br>    <br>  Organizations interested in attending the NSRDEC Textile Industry Day should register for one day only either 24or 25 June 2014 by 2:00 pm (EDT, 16 MAY, 2014 via the URL below.

AMENDMENT 2

J-6 VRTM attachment has been removed due to its duplication, the VRTM was incorporated into the SSD document.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.	INTRODUCTION
On March 19, 2014, the TFDM program presented the Business Case analysis data and successfully obtained the Initial Investment Decision (IID). Although the Program achieved a favorable IID, the TFDM program must continue to seek opportunities to increase its affordability and benefit/cost ratio. The first step in achieving this goal is performing RFI #3.

2.	 AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM 2014
FAA is considering any and all options for structuring the SIR at this time and seeks the input from industry regarding specific risks, and benefits of acquisition strategies.

In addition to this RFI, the TFDM program office may release updates and or draft version of the Statement of Work for industry comment prior to releasing any future SIR or RFP.  Any and all future releases will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (FAACO) https://faaco.faa.gov/) and the FAA-TFDM program web site. http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/pmo/proj/tfdm/

TFDM program information, general scope, high level service and system requirements, and initial plans will be presented to industry as part of the FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Program Management Organization (PMO) Industry Forum on April 23 and 24, 2014. The TFDM information presented during this 2-day forum event will be available from the TFDM program office web site.

3.	 FAACO ANNOUNCEMENT
This Request for Information (RFI) #3 announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.2.1. 

This RFI will be used by the FAA for information gathering purposes only. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Any cost associated with the preparation and submittal of such information, in written format only, is solely at each vendors expense. 

The FAA is anticipating releasing a Full & Open Competition, with a mixture of pricing CLINS, and a period of performance of approximately twelve (12) years. The period of performance is anticipated to be a (5) year base and (7) one year options.

4.	PURPOSE:
The TFDM Program Office is now soliciting input from industry through RFI #3 for assistance in identifying applicable best practices, review and comment of the acquisition statement of work and documentation and information concerning specific questions the FAA has on select aspects of the program. The information provided in this RFI #3 reflects the program scope and strategy presented at the IID decision, which the FAA is currently analyzing. The FAA intends to use its own analysis, along with industry RFI#3 responses to validate the initial acquisition strategy, improve the overall quality of the initial acquisition solicitation documentation, further refine statement of work requirements and specification requirements.  The resulting effort will likely take advantage of opportunities for cost savings and cost avoidance that will change TFDMs scope and program strategy and improve TFDMs Business Case for FID. The revised scope and program strategy will be reflected in subsequent updates to the solicitation documentation.

5.     QUESTION/ANSWERS: RFI and AVIATION INDUSTRY FORUM QUESTIONS:
Both Aviation Industry Forum and RFI questions may be submitted through April 30, 2014 @ 9:00 A.M.  only.  Q&As allow Industry an opportunity to better understand the RFI and to follow up on the Aviation Industry Forum to be able to address the Questions in a more expeditious manner.  All questions must be sent to the Contracting Officer, (CO) Leslie Fisher, leslie.fisher@faa.gov; phone calls or any unannounced visits will be turned away. Those question(s) received after 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on 4/30/2014 may be addressed after the RFI closing as time permits.

The FAA-TFDM PMO and Contracting Officer will make every effort to address questions from Industry. The audience must be advised that due to the program being in the early stages of developing the SIR, all questions must be submitted in writing through the FAACO website and allow the stated time allowed the program office to review and address each question so that all submitted question may be consolidated and posted for all the Public to view equally. 

Industry shall traced each of their question or comment back to the document, attachment or to Industry Day, the page and or  paragraph must be identified along with any other identification that will assist the FAA in referring back to the area of question for ease of follow through.  			

All responses prepared by the FAA in regards to the RFI and Industry Forum that are received will be consolidated into one publication and posted on FAACO and the TFDM Web page for the ease of Public reference.

<DESC>Rference:  Sources Sought Notice (SSN) / Request for Information (RFI), N00104-13-N-Q451 posted on 9/4/2013.

This is a Presolicitation Notice for COMNAVMETOCCOMs requirement for Infrastructure Support Services and Information Assurance Support Services.

The Contractor shall support the COMNAVMETOCCOM enterprise by conducting special studies; preparing operational concepts; analyzing risk; and developing algorithms, processes, and recommendations on relevant subjects to collect, process, manage, and transmit Meteorology, Oceanographic data, and Geospatial Information & Services (GI&S). The Contractor shall also provide technical support and systems engineering to facilitate migration of associated systems, within the guidelines of the DoD Corporate Information Management initiative to achieve interoperability and to establish the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management compliant processing architecture.
 The Contractor shall support government personnel in ensuring that software design, development, and maintenance activities comply with federal, DoD, DON, and COMNAVMETOCCOM policies including, but not limited to, Information Assurance and net centricity. 

Deliverables must comply with all applicable DoD security configuration or implementation guides. This includes, but is not limited to DISA Secure Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). Reference: DODI 8500.2, IA Control: ECSC-1, Subject: Security Configuration Compliance, Requirement: For Enclaves and AIS applications, all DoD security configuration or implementation guides have been applied.

The contractor shall provide technical support for the following Information Technology Programs:

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) is an ACAT IA Program Of Record (PoR), which now includes all former IT Programs within the NMOC Enterprise, including POPS-Monterey (formerly just POPS), Oceanographic Information System (OIS), Meteorology and Oceanography Systems (METOCSYS), the Precise Time and Astrometry  (PTA) Systems work at the Naval Observatory, and all other IT work.
  

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) for Oceanography (Oceans) is an operational information system within DOD providing automated support for oceanographic data collection, processing, analysis, product generation, and distribution.  POPS - Oceans products provide critical direct operational support to all mission areas of the fleet and other forces that operate on, under, over, or near the worlds oceans. Formerly known as the Oceanographic Information System (OIS), POPS-Oceans is the primary information technology domain at NAVOCEANO and is the enabler for oceanographic information and predictions in support of Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW), Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Mine Warfare (MIW), and submarine/ship navigation.
 The OIS program involves automated Information Resource / Information Management support for multi-disciplinary ocean surveys, assigned scientific and technical projects, and oceanographic product generation and distribution at NAVOCEANO and its subordinate commands, the Naval Ice Center (NAVICECEN) and Fleet Survey Team (FST). Also at NAVOCEANO is the Surf Eagle (SE) program tasked to produce and disseminate oceanographic/littoral and riverine environmental intelligence, analysis, and special products primarily in support of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met), located at FLENUMMETOCCEN at Monterey, CA provides the key production engine enabling global METOC support of the fleet.
 POPS-Met operates within a 24/7 reach back operations center supporting global fleet operations with weather and ocean prediction products and war fighting applications that are critical to fleet safety and war fighting effectiveness. POPS-Met provides the technology and infrastructure to sustain global operations ashore and afloat by providing timely, relevant, 24/7 METOC data and products to the fleet, Department of Defense, joint, allied, and coalition warfighters at all classification levels. POPS-Met acquires and sustains the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) environments to provide most of the assured METOC forecast products and services for Tier 1 of the Battlespace on Demand, which originate directly from the METOC models, satellite processing software, and applications.
 Tier 1 also provides input to many of the Battlespace on Demand Tier 2 and Tier 3 Products. Ongoing technology refreshment is required to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly in response to greater emphasis on preparation for and response to regional conflicts, and the greater data volume from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and future remotely sensed environmental data sources. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support. Together, these enhancements will provide the Fleet with more accurate and responsive environmental support across all three Tiers of Battlespace on Demand.
 POPS-Met supports DoDs principle operational processing center for numerical meteorology and oceanography (METOC) analysis and prediction.

The combined programs maintain COMNAVMETOCCOM, USNAVOBSY, FLENUMMETOCCEN,
NAVOCEANO, NAVICECEN, FST, NAVOCEANOPSCOM, and the echelon IV activities scientific
Information Technology (IT) systems in support of established METOC requirements and coordinates the modernization of these assets to ensure efficient operations and the infusion of new technology.

Work to be performed will be divided into two Functional Areas: Functional Area # 1-Infrastructure
Support, IT System Administration, Communications, Cross Domain Solutions (CDS), and Functional Area # 2-Information Assurance under Section C.6 of the PWS.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541380- Testing Laboratories, for an upcoming requirement for a Geologic Carbon Sequestration Project that will: conduct focused, more detailed geological studies and assessments of selected basins with high potential for CO2 sequestration; carry out geologic studies of natural and anthropogenic CO2 storage sites; develop a methodology and conduct assessments of enhanced oil and gas recovery (EOR and EGR) associated with CO2 injection; and develop a methodology and assessment of unconventional CO2 storage reservoirs (such as coal and shale beds) and evaluate their sequestration potential.  The USGS Eastern Energy Resources Science Center (EERSC) has an ongoing requirement for analysis of the composition of the gas and analysis of the stable carbon isotopic composition and stable hydrogen isotopic composition. The exact number of samples varies from year to year, and largely depends on sample accessibility during field campaigns in remote regions and will be determined by quantities, funding, period of performance, and any other variables in separate task orders. Generally, we anticipate collecting approximately 10-30 for analysis.  Interested vendors must be capable of providing all capabilities.
Technical Requirements All chemical analysis should be based on standards accurate to within 2% and preformed by experienced chemists on well-maintained and calibrated equipment.  Isotopic ratios measured by mass spectrometry are to be based on standards that are accurate to within 0.1 per mil for carbon, 0.3 per mil for nitrogen, and 5 per mil for hydrogen. QUALITY OF DATA Chemical analyses are to be performed by gas chromatography for molecular concentrations of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, n-pentane, iso-pentane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, argon, oxygen and nitrogen. Isotopic compositions of individual components are to be determined by mass spectrometry as follows: carbon isotopic of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, n-pentane and carbon dioxide; hydrogen isotopic composition of methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, and n-pentane; nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrogen.  The analytical laboratory will supply stainless steel sample cylinders and DOT approved shipping containers. Some samples may be shipped to the analytical laboratory in government-owned stainless steel cylinders.  Analytical laboratory to provide sample archiving to allow the option of additional analyses at a later date. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

<p>II. Introduction</p>
<p>The SWFF Technical Assistance Facility (hereby referred to as the Facility) is an essential component of Securing Water for Food: A Grand Challenge for Development (SWFF). The Facility will manage the milestone-based financing provided to the awardees, and provide monitoring and evaluation and acceleration support to 10-30 SWFF awardees . The Facility will work in coordination with the awardees, SWFF Founding Partners (USAID, Sida, and the Foreign Ministry of the Netherlands), and other parties that directly support SWFF.</p>
<p>III. Background</p>
<p>On September 2, 2013 in Stockholm, the Founding Partners launched SWFF. Through this Grand Challenge for Development, we are identifying and accelerating science and technology innovations and market-driven approaches that enable the production of more food with less water and/or make more water available for food production, processing, and distribution in developing and emerging countries.</p>
<p>SWFF is focused on three areas that are critical to reducing water scarcity in the food value chain:</p>
<p>&bull; Water Efficiency and Reuse - especially targeted at the food value chain. This will become a greater necessity as water availability is threatened by competition between industrial, agricultural, and energy uses. Improving water efficiency and reuse has tremendous potential water-saving benefits that may have multiplier effects at various levels of a country's economy. <br />&bull; Water Capture and Storage. These systems are in high demand in many regions where rain occurs at limited times. With projected increases in rainfall variability due to climate change and increased demands for food production, capture and storage systems at various scales are needed to secure water supplies throughout the year and build resiliency to drought and floods.<br />&bull; Salinity and Salt Water Intrusion. In coastal areas, over pumping and rising sea levels are leading to saltwater intrusion, forcing farmers to use marginal quality water for irrigation. With more than 30% of the world's population living in coastal areas and drawing food supply from fertile deltas, urgent solutions are required to reduce the impacts of salinity on the quality of aquifers and food production.</p>
<p>SWFF will support innovators at two stages of development:</p>
<p>&bull; Stage 1 - Market-driven product/business development: These innovations have been verified through a standalone pilot or a series of pilots and now need to be tested and adapted for adoption in new developing or emerging countries. These innovations may require technical validation and proof of adoption/uptake in a new market.<br />&bull; Stage 2 - Scaling/Commercial Growth: These are established innovations that have already demonstrated a viable business model and are generating revenue. They require support for commercial growth, including adaptation of the innovation for larger scale production, market adoption, and distribution. It is expected that these innovations have already demonstrated technical feasibility and market acceptance and can provide evidence supporting these points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Tranched Funding</p>
<p>Securing Water for Food awardees will be eligible for up to three tranches of funding. All awardees will receive an initial tranche of funding in Year 1. Initial funding will depend, in part, on the stage of innovation as shown below.</p>
<p>To receive future tranches of funding, the IIAC and the Founding Partners will review technical and financial milestones and assess market conditions to ensure that the innovation is still viable and has the potential to achieve wide-scale adoption. This will be a transparent process. In some cases, this market assessment will likely require an adjustment of milestones.</p>
<p>Innovators who achieve mutually agreed-upon technical and financial milestones (see Section I.3.D) will be eligible to receive future tranches of funding (one tranche in Year 2 and one tranche in Year 3). All funding is subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Maximum levels of initial and future funding are presented in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1: Funding Levels<br />Stage of Innovation <br />Maximum Initial Financial<br />Support Maximum Future Financial<br />Support (total)<br />Stage 1 - Market driven product/business development $100,000 $500,000<br />Stage 2 - Scaling/Commercial Growth: $500,000 $3 million</p>
<p><br />Matching Funds / In-Kind Contribution Requirements<br />As described below, requirements for matching funds or in-kind contributions will vary, depending on 1) the stage of innovation (Stage 1 or Stage 2), and 2) the tranche of funding being considered (initial or subsequent tranches).</p>
<p>Stage 1 (market-driven product/business development) awardees must have either matching funds (cash/cash equivalent) or in-kind contributions to satisfy the matching requirements. In-kind contributions can come from internal or external sources. Examples of external in-kind contributions include the value of time donated by technical or business experts and technology, communications, or capital assets. Resource-sharing from publicly-funded programs also qualifies as external in-kind matching. Examples of internal in-kind contributions include the value of salaries for staff dedicated to a project or self-investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 1:<br />Market-driven product/business development % Match Required % Match Required<br />Initial (upon award) Future (up to 2 tranches)<br />25% 50%</p>
<p>Note that, while either matching funds or in-kind contributions are acceptable for Stage 1 awardees, we strongly encourage Stage 1 applicants to have matching funds (cash/cash equivalent).</p>
<p><br />Stage 2 (Scaling/Commercial Growth) awardees are required to have matching funds (cash/cash equivalent) to satisfy the matching requirements. Stage 2 awardees are not allowed to rely upon in-kind contributions to meet the matching requirements. Note also that matching funds for Stage 2 awardees must come from external sources and must be provided on market, quid-pro-quo terms. For example, the entity that is providing the external matching funds may provide cash or a cash equivalent to the awardee in return for equity, an advance purchase order, a share of royalties, rights in the technology, a percentage of profit, or any other similar combination thereof. The external funds must pay for activities that further the growth, development, or commercialization of the innovator's technology (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, and marketing). The external matching funds may not be obtained through a grant, gift, or any other non-market-based terms.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Scaling/Commercial Growth % Match Required % Match Required<br />Initial (upon award) Future (up to 2 tranches)<br />25% 50%</p>
<p><br />For both Stage 1 and Stage 2 awardees, the full match will be required prior to the release of additional tranches of funding. For example, a Stage 2 innovator who receives $500,000 as an initial tranche will be required to provide 25% matching funds. At the start of Year 2, the innovator is eligible for an additional $1,000,000 (illustrative) and must provide 50% matching funds. At the start of Year 3, the innovator is eligible for an additional $1.5 million (illustrative) and must provide 50% matching funds. (This Section of Tranched Funding is part of the Securing Water For Food Solicitation and is for informational purposes only, if you wish to view this solicitation in its entirety please click on the link provided below): https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=154483d98f0aa32c1c2c831b51330bf3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</p>
<p>Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The Founding Partners opened the first "call for innovations" in November 2013 and invited Concept Note submissions from applicants around the world. After evaluating over 500 Concept Notes, the Founding Partners have invited 83 semi-finalists to submit a Full Proposal that addresses a more rigorous set of questions about their innovation and target market. In July 2014, the Founding Partners will convene in-person interviews with the top ~40 finalists. In September 2014, the Founding Partners will make ~10-30 awards and provide chosen innovators with a combination of financial and technical support. Awardees may be nonprofits, for-profits, universities, research institutions, or consortia.</p>

<p><br />A. SWFF Accelerator</p>
<p>A.1 Objectives</p>
<p>The objective of the Accelerator is to help SWFF-supported innovators reach scale. The Accelerator will:</p>
<p>&bull; Determine the appropriate level/type of acceleration support to be provided to finalists and awardees depending on their performance and development stage.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate their ability to function as a highly networked apex organization that draws on multiple firms/organizations for business development, investment facilitation, and partnership development. The offerors extensive network will enable them to flexibly provide technically and geographically varied services depending on the individual needs of SWFF innovators. This type of networked organization will be able to provide training at the group level in addition to facilitating specific market based development per awardee. Services should be sourced both from international and local firms/organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>&bull; Create connections to the marketplace, providing direct assistance (or facilitating the provision of assistance) to awardees, enabling them to refine their innovations, access new markets, bring in outside capital, develop partnerships, and - ultimately - have measureable impact in improving water availability and efficiency along the food value chain, thus boosting food security, alleviating poverty, and stimulating inclusive growth.</p>
<p>&bull; Directly provide or manage the provision of a wide array of services to participating SWFF awardees to increase demand for their innovations and increase their organizational and institutional capacity to meet that demand - both of which are likely required to bring SWFF innovations to scale. The Accelerator will provide both supply and demand side advisory services. Some technical assistance may be delivered to all awardees participating in the Accelerator, and other types of assistance will need to be targeted towards individual awardees. As further outlined under "Specific Tasks and Deliverables" below, this assistance may include advisory services, technical services, and partnership facilitation. Supply side interventions may include: improving the innovation, capacity building of the management team, improving distribution models, gaining operational efficiency, and expanding access to capital to finance the growth strategy. Demand-side interventions may include: improving market linkages, securing contracts, building partnerships, enabling penetration of new markets, and support in attracting a growing customer base.</p>
<p>&bull; While the Accelerator should propose their general acceleration methodology (including a robust menu of direct technical advisory offerings and marketplace facilitation opportunities), we recognize that not all innovator needs can (or should) be identified in advance. The Accelerator must therefore propose a methodology for identifying and sourcing highly specialized services that may require additional subcontractors and/or the management of a voucher program, whereby innovators would receive a voucher toward the procurement of services from organizations screened by the Facility Manager.</p>
<p>A.2 Specific Tasks and Deliverables</p>
<p>The full scope of targeted services will depend on the needs of each innovator participating in the Accelerator. The following, however, are general support categories that the Accelerator will be expected to provide. Offerors should propose cost-effective ways of delivering the services described below (for example, some activities could be done virtually and/or in groups).</p>
<p>The Accelerator shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide overall management of the Acceleration sub-component. This includes providing direct technical assistance to SWFF awardees, as well as provisioning assistance from consortium members or additional providers that have yet-to-be identified (see flexible subcontracting or voucher program below).</p>
<p>&bull; Provide Acceleration Facilitators who will manage the relationships with all awardees. The role of the Acceleration Facilitator will be to work with the innovator and the USAID Program Manager to develop Acceleration work plans that will help the innovators meet their technical and financial milestones, track progress on the Acceleration work plans, and develop semi-annual reports (with a summary of key actions, qualitative findings of opportunities and challenges and reporting on acceleration metrics) for each innovator.</p>
<p>&bull; Create a network of mentors for SWFF innovators. Mentoring is a productive way to connect innovators with industry professionals, which may lead to valuable partnership opportunities. The Accelerator will establish a mentor network, drawing from the water and agricultural industries, as well as other corporations, financial institutions, universities, and nonprofits. The Acceleration Facilitator will match awardees with mentors that can provide insight, advice, and assistance. Offerors should propose creative and cost-efficient ways of sourcing and retaining mentors throughout the duration of the SWFF program.</p>
<p>&bull; Create a flexible subcontracting or voucher program. If the Accelerator or a member of its consortium is unable to directly provide services, the Manager will source and competitively contract providers to deliver this support. The Accelerator will also oversee the delivery of support. These services may alternatively be procured through a voucher program, whereby the innovator identifies the provider and the Accelerator provides a voucher that the innovator can use to procure needed services.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate access to investors and opportunities to raise capital for innovators who are seeking outside capital. Activities may include holding workshops on investment-preparedness; convening investors' circles; facilitating co-investment partnerships with investors and/or other financial intermediaries; facilitating partnerships with risk insurance entities; and helping innovators source and close deals. Investment-related activities and follow-up actions will be documented in the Acceleration work plans at six-month reviews.</p>
<p>&bull; Enable partnerships for innovators who are seeking partners. The Accelerator should initiate and grow relationships that result in business linkages between SWFF innovators and the private sector. Activities may include helping commercially ready innovators to develop marketing and distribution strategies, overall sales and business development support, partnership development, and facilitation of international marketing opportunities. Types of partnership opportunities may include co-investment opportunities with commercial water technology, engineering, or similar companies; partnerships to develop and commercialize new water technologies (such as advance market/purchase commitments); or due diligence/ validation/screening partnerships (particularly focused on Stage 1 awardees).</p>
<p>A.3 Mechanism</p>
<p>The prime contractor may hire a sub-contractor through at least 1 Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) subcontract of approximately $3.25M. Additional subcontracts/grants and STTA/LTTA can be awarded, as required. The table below shows the award fee that the Accelerator will receive for each innovator that meets the established technical and financial milestones (thus enabling the awardee to receive future tranches of SWFF funding).</p>
<p>Review / Funding Tranche Award Fee Amount<br />6-month Review (March 2015) NA<br />Annual Review/Tranche 2 (September 2015) TBD<br />6-month Review (March 2016) NA<br />Annual Review/Tranche 3 (September 2016) TBD<br />6-month Review (March 2017) NA<br />Annual Review (September 2017) TBD</p>
<p>For each participating innovator that successfully meets technical and financial milestones at the annual review, the Accelerator shall be awarded the set award fee amount from the above table (to be proposed by offeror). In the event that an awardee does not meet technical and financial milestones at the annual review, the Accelerator will not receive an award fee. The entire amount shall be put into the award fee pool and the contractor shall invoice not more frequently than every year. For the purposes of proposal submissions, offerors should assume the following: <br />&bull; 100% of SWFF awardees will participate in the Facility<br />&bull; 75% of SWFF awardees will be Stage 1 and 25% will be Stage 2<br />&bull; 50% of Stage 1 awardees will achieve their milestones annually<br />&bull; 50% of Stage 2 awardees will achieve their milestones annually<br />For each participating innovator, the USAID Program Manager and the Acceleration Facilitator will conduct a six-month collaborative review. The six-month review is a flexible opportunity for all parties to check innovator progress and make adjustments to annual milestones as necessary.</p>
<p>A.4. Results</p>
<p>Results sought under this contract (for innovators who use the services of the Facility) will include:<br />&bull; Increased technical and financial viability of SWFF-supported innovations<br />&bull; Increased usage/uptake of SWFF-supported innovations<br />&bull; Expanded number of partnerships between SWFF awardees and the private sector<br />&bull; Increased amount of outside capital attracted by SWFF awardees<br />&bull; Expanded number of collaborations between SWFF awardees and industry experts<br />&bull; Improved organizational and institutional capacity of SWFF innovators<br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />B. SWFF Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)</p>
<p>B.1 Objectives<br />The M&amp;E provider will:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide vital support services to the SWFF Founding Partners to enable their effective management, monitoring and evaluation of the program; and <br />&bull; Facilitate the dissemination and transfer of SWFF-related knowledge and lessons learned to further promote the design and deployment of innovations that produce more food using less water and/or make more water available for food production, processing, or distribution in developing countries.</p>
<p>B.2 Specific Tasks <br />The following types of activities will be undertaken by the M&amp;E provider:<br />&bull; Advising on and strengthening SWFF awardees' ability to comply with USAID policies and procedures. SWFF anticipates that many of the awardees may be organizations that have little or no experience working with USAID. The subcontractor shall serve as a front-line resource for the awardees in understanding and complying with USAID operational policies and procedures, such as those articulated in the Automated Directives System (ADS). Anticipated areas of assistance may include, but are not limited to: facilitating pre-award surveys, establishing appropriate accounting and financial management practices, and providing guidance in technical/financial reporting. Specific activities may include the preparation of standard awardee operation manuals/guidelines, providing individualized assistance to awardees, hosting training workshops, and establishing an awardee "hotline" through which tailored assistance may be remotely provided.</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring awardee performance. The M&amp;E provider shall assist SWFF with overseeing the implementation and progress of the awards. This will include the following types of activities:</p>
<p>(a) Quality control of awardee progress reporting: Given many awardees' expected lack of familiarity with USAID reporting requirements, the contractor shall review their progress reports, which may include semi-annual and annual reports, for completeness and coherency before they are submitted to USAID. The M&amp;E provider shall prepare a reporting template for awardees to follow, including progress towards meeting project objectives and reporting on the relevant, selected indicators described in the awardees' monitoring and evaluation plan. Any reporting templates produced shall be reviewed by USAID before being finalized, and could be developed as an input to the Award Management Online Platform (see (c) below).</p>
<p>(b) Field visits to verify achievements and assist with addressing any shortcomings: As required, the subcontractor/grantee shall travel with the USAID Program Manager to the awardees' implementation sites to verify reported achievements and the completion of project milestones, which may be required for payment of invoices under Fixed Obligation Grants (FOGs), and provide guidance to awardees on overcoming any obstacles that may be hindering project progress.</p>
<p>(c) Development and maintenance of an Award Management Online Platform: The M&amp;E provider shall develop an online platform that will enable the SWFF Partners to quickly access real-time information on the awardees' projects and current performance. The platform should include reader-friendly presentation of the projects' objectives, place of implementation, targets, current results, identified risks to achieving targets, and links to any associated material such as press releases, videos, etc. The platform should also provide access to an archive of the awardees' documents, including relevant contractual information and progress reports.</p>
<p>NOTE: If there is already an existing Grand Challenges for Development online M&amp;E platform at the time of the implementation of this contract, the contractor will make sure to assist awardees and, where necessary, directly enter awardee projects' objectives, place of implementation, targets, current results, identified risks to achieving targets, and links to any associated material such as press releases, videos, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; Designing and conducting performance and impact evaluations: The M&amp;E provider shall work with SWFF to further implement the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for SWFF that links to the broad "meta-level" Grand Challenge for Development (GCD) Strategic Framework as well as the SWFF Strategic Framework. Additionally, the M&amp;E provider shall assist SWFF and awardees with developing individual project monitoring and evaluation plans that include targets and indicators tailored to the awardees' individual projects and inclusive of USAID standard indicators for water and agriculture subject areas. <br /><br />(a) As required, the M&amp;E provider shall perform mid-term project performance evaluations that, inter alia, assess progress towards achieving the projects' objectives, identifies implementation obstacles and assesses awardees' efforts to overcome them, and recommends any mid-term project modifications. The M&amp;E provider may also perform end-of-project performance evaluations that assess the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved and captures lessons learned that may be informative for the design of future SWFF projects. The M&amp;E provider may also be required to assist with the design and execution of impact evaluations that typically utilize counterfactual analysis to assess the changes, both intended and unintended, that can be attributed the project. During the development of the overall monitoring and evaluation framework, the contractor shall advise on the feasibility and likely effectiveness of impact evaluations and timing and characteristics of baseline data collection.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop M&amp;E training manuals for awardees: The M&amp;E provider should prepare manuals for the online M&amp;E platform, a "How-To" guide for reporting, and "Understanding USAID M&amp;E requirements". The training materials should be able to easily be viewed as a single document (PDF and/or PPT), as well as throughout the online database. Training materials should include "quick tips" and FAQs.</p>
<p>&bull; Transferring SWFF lessons learned: To transfer knowledge gained from SWFF projects and activities and strengthen USAID and partner programs in the water-agriculture nexus, the contractor shall provide technical advice on the lessons learned from SWFF innovations on how to incorporate water solutions in the design and implementation of USG agricultural and food security programs, such as Feed the Future. Other activities may include preparing course curriculums and materials, inviting speakers, and giving presentations; &amp; preparation of analytical papers, toolkits and other materials to disseminate SWFF lessons learned.</p>
<p>B.3 Deliverables</p>
<p>&bull; Work Plan. Within 30 days of contract award, the M&amp;E provider shall submit a draft work plan to the Contractor that describes key objectives, activities, milestones, responsible contractor staff and/ or sub-contractors, and timeframe.</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. Within 45 days of the contract award, the M&amp;E provider shall develop an operation plan to implement the overall SWFF M&amp;E Framework. The operational plan will be developed in close consultation with the SWFF Chief of Party, and include components for assessing outputs, outcomes, and, as appropriate, impacts with associated key indicators and methodologies for their measurement. Up to three times per year, the M&amp;E provider shall monitor and verify progress results through site visits, interviews, and review of project documentation.</p>
<p>&bull; SWFF Awardees' Progress Reporting. The M&amp;E provider shall prepare a progress report template for the SWFF awardees to document their progress in meeting project objectives and reporting on the relevant, selected indicators described in the awardees' monitoring and evaluation plan.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluations. The M&amp;E provider shall design and perform evaluations and outcome harvesting, as described above.</p>
<p>&bull; Award Management Online Platform. The M&amp;E provider shall develop an online platform that will enable the SWFF Partners to quickly access information on the awardees' projects and current performance. The platform should include reader-friendly presentation of the projects' objectives, place of implementation, targets, current results, identified risks to achieving targets, and links to any associated material such as press releases, videos, etc. The platform should also provide access to an archive of the awardees' documents, including relevant contractual information and progress reports. The platform should have the ability to update some relevant information in real time.<br />&emsp;<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Securing Water for Food Technical Assistance Facility. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. USAID has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The contractor will provide the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) with identified bug fixes in the HEC-FIA software.  This includes bug fixes and modifications to the FIA Study folder, the Watershed folder, Geographic Data Folder, Inundation data folder, (hydraulic data), FIA Inventory folder, and the Time window folder, in addition to any other changes to the GUI or computational engine edits requested by the lead developer.  Programmer support for the HEC-FIA software package is necessary during the in-house testing period as well as during its production release period to troubleshoot package integration issues with HEC-FIA calculations, fix bugs, and address other issues such as installation support.

It is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type contract with firm-fixed-price task orders. The contract is currently in Option Period One. GE Energy Power Conversion provides maintenance and support of the Machinery Plant Systems/Components and Machinery Centralized Control System (MCCS) on the T-AKE Class vessels. Services under the resulting contract include periodic equipment grooms, technical representative visits, telephone consultations, remote technical support via e-mail and phone, hardware and software configuration management services, new/overhauled parts supply, and training. The major systems/components of the T-AKE Class vessels covered under the contract include the MCCS, propulsion control system, propulsion motor, propulsion transformers &amp; heat exchangers, ship's service transformers, and switchboards.
<p>The services required under this contract are a unique combination of logistic, material, engineering, field support, and automation control which are all specific to the T-AKE Class vessel. The required services are proprietary in nature to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), GE Energy Power Conversion. GE Energy Power Conversion holds the privileges to the data required to provide the necessary parts, and also holds all the proprietary rights for the electrical propulsion drive software and MCCS updates.

<DESC>1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for the renewal of the annual license fee for use and maintenance of Polk's Complete Pre-Fix File on behalf of DS/OFM/OA. <br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS) is processing the acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Foreign Missions, Information Management (DS/OFM/IM). This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) on brand name basis is for use of R.L. Polk's CPF, Complete Prefix File (aka VINA), which VIN Verification Solution that was developed by Polk for use in business and government entities in order to verify VINs, flag errors, and return descriptive vehicle information. The use of brand name is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State, Office of Foreign Missions information System thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company which would need system re-customization. The re-customization of OFM Information system would result in exorbitant duplicative costs for the re-configuration to allow for another vendors VIN Verification Solution to interface with our existing system which are far greater costs that exceed simply remaining with the existing vendor (Polk).<br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Foreign Missions TOMIS system is integrated into R.L. Polk's CPF, Complete Prefix File (aka VINA) file. This system has been a part of the integrated system and has provided service for many years. VINA is a required component of the registration process and is a standard applied by most state and local DMV authorities to validate vehicle numbers of vehicles manufactured and/or sold in the United States. Because of the sensitive nature of information derived from VIA, it must be properly maintained. No supplies are required; the contract is for the service only.<br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.<br />5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualification or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />See Paragraph #3, R.L. POLK is the only provider for this service.<br />6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as it practicable. As required by FAR 5.2, a notice will be publicized to provide fair opportunity.&nbsp; A justifacation and Solicitation was posted on FBO.Gov for industry awareness.&nbsp;<br /><br />7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. A/LM/AQM has conducted a brief informal survey on-line of providers to include considering estimated costs of re-configuration of the Office of Foreign Missions Information System to accommodate a competing vendor. It has been determined that any re-configuration costs would off-set the costs of any gains from competition. In addition the costs could be considered duplicative as cited in FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A). The offered price from Polk is considered fair and reasonable based on an invoice received for another agency receiving similar service from Polk and based on past acquisition history were prices have not significantly increased over time since our beginning usage., <br />.<br />8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.&nbsp; DS/OFM/IM has researched vendors of vehicle identification number (VIN) software and R.L. Polk was identified as the only vendor that provides a standard VIN verification product that is widely used by DMV's throughout the U.S. A/LM/QM has found other possible sources, but no other source is currently configured to operate with the DS/OFM/IM information system. <br /><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. <br />See detail in paragraphs (1) through (8) above.<br /><br />10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />N/A.
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.<br />At this time the current IT infrastructure deployed by the DoS does not allow for any additional industry solutions. However, as DoS deployed infrastructure evolves with industry technology, further solutions will be considered competitively.</p>

The price of <a title="Electricity generation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">power generation</span></a> depends largely on the type and <a title="Market price" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_price"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">market price</span></a> of the fuel used, government subsidies, government and industry regulation, and even local weather patterns</span></p>
