<DESC>A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Engineering Department by performing a variety of Engineering  related functions including, but not limited to, technology development, application, planning, analysis, design and acquisition management and integrated life cycle support  planning, maintenance and environmental management, and software management in support of USPS operational and financial goals. The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of performing in a professional environment in support of the systems and technology transforming the USPS into a world class 21st Century business.

Currently Engineering uses over 150 contract persons in numerous labor categories, funded by various different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Most contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Depending upon assignment, some contract employees may travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fisherman's Association for the implementation of the ACCSP 2005 Electronic Vessel Reporting Pilot Project.  Currently, all miltispecies permitted fishing vessels are required to report catch and related data using paper Vessel Trip Reports (VTRs).   Amendment 13 to the fishing regulation has sharply increased the number and precision of monitoring requirements by implementing several small Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for stock areas of species of concern, and implementing a new Days-At-Sea (DAS) regime.  TACs require greater timelines in monitoring amounts caught to allow for the same forecast precision as a large TAC.  NMFS requires a coordinated system that provides both timely vessel and dealer information.  The contractor shall test replacing the current paper-based vessel reporting system with an electronic system to demonstrate improved fishery management by linking vessel reports to Dealer Electronic Reporting (DER) in a coordinated system.  The statutory authority for this proposed action is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(3), Only One Responsible Source.  Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fisherman's Association is uniquely as the only local organization with current applications and capabilities to perform the pilot project.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.  The size standard is $6 million.  This proposed action is anticipated to be below the simplified acquisition threshold of $100 thousand.  No award shall be made based on any response to this announcement as this is not a request for quotations.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), plans to establish a DHS Information Technology (IT) department-wide contract for commodity products under the program name First Source. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. IT commodity products and solutions represents a significant portion of the DHS’s IT budget and are currently provided through a disparate collection of acquisition methods, including Component-centric contracts, task orders against General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and InterAgency Agreements. The establishment of a consolidated portfolio of multiple-award IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department is considered a primary ITAC objective. The First Source Program will support the DHS goal of a functionally integrated Department, promoting standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among and between the various Components with the IT products and systems that enhance mission effectiveness and create economies of scale through the buying-power of the Department as a whole through consolidation of requirements. In support of its mission and strategic goals, DHS requires commercial IT commodity solutions for a wide variety of applications throughout the Department and its 22 Operating Components. DHS needs to access technological advances as they occur, and new business practices that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHS’s Department-wide buying power to obtain competitive prices. Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), producers, and suppliers. The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to: IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology; on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking; and associated product maintenance, installation, and support.  The First Source Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractor’s commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. The First Source procurement is a Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code 541519; the business size standard is 150 employees. First Source is a complementary program to the EAGLE program.  EAGLE contractors will use First Source as a “mandatory for use” source for any equipment requirements in their task orders issued under EAGLE. The First Source procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts.  Contract term is a two-year base period with three one-year options. The Source Selection will be conducted using a best value analysis.  Evaluation factors for award will emphasize price, technical and management solutions, and past performance. The number of contract awards for all commodities will be sufficient to maintain adequate competition for specific delivery orders for products during the entire term of the contract. Offerors will be required to propose their published, commercial IT commodity catalogs for any or all of the required products. Prices for products included in the offerors’ catalogs will be based on the offerors’ proposed Dynamic Pricing Model (DPM). The DPM is the offeror’s proposed pricing mechanism which is devised to continuously assure that the most competitive prices for its offered products are available to DHS for the duration of the contract. First Source is not intended as a direct replacement of any legacy small or large business contracts. Rather, the high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.  Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the delivery order level. First Source contracts will promote the use of performance-based contracting.  Specific equipment requirements will be defined in individual delivery orders that will be competed prior to their issuance.  Delivery orders will have their own delivery or performance period requirements.  IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. DHS intends to conduct an Industry Day in which senior DHS procurement and IT officials will provide an overview of their strategies and perspectives on both Department-wide and Component initiatives. The date for the Industry Day will be announced via FedBizOpps. Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and only two representatives from each company will be allowed.  There is no registration fee associated with attending this event.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail confirming their attendance for the Industry Day session. More information regarding the First Source Program can be found at www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. It is anticipated that the First Source RFP will be released in early September 2005, via FedBizOpps, with contract awards in early CY2006. The draft First Source RFP is posted with this synopsis. Written comments received at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov on or before August 26, 2005 will be considered for inclusion in the final First Source RFP.  Due to the anticipated level of interest, the Contracting Officer will not entertain requests for vendor visitations or marketing calls, or respond to telephonic inquiries.  Future information regarding First Source, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, and vendor questions and DHS responses related to the First Source RFP, when posted, will be released to the public through the FedBizOpps  and the DHS.gov website. Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to DHS at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), plans to establish DHS department-wide contracts for Information Technology (IT) support services under the program name EAGLE. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. Support services represent a significant portion of the DHS’s IT budget and are currently provided through a disparate collection of acquisition methods, including Component-centric contracts, task orders against General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and InterAgency Agreements.  The establishment of a consolidated portfolio of broad scope, multiple-award IT supports service contracts that are available for use throughout the Department is considered a primary ITAC objective.  The EAGLE Program will support the DHS goal of a functionally integrated Department, demanding integrated methods of operation among and between the various Components with the IT support systems that enhance mission effectiveness and create economies of scale through consolidation.  

EAGLE will provide for a wide range of IT service solutions for DHS through five comprehensive functional service categories (FC) stated here in their entirety: (FC1) Infrastructure Engineering Design, Development, Implementation, and Integration. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of system design and development through deployment to ensure DHS IT solutions will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives. These efforts include the full range of infrastructure engineering design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, integration, implementation, and deployment. (FC2) Operations and Maintenance. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all operations and maintenance (O&M) solutions, processes, and procedures necessary to sustain systems within the DHS Enterprise at the highest levels of service and availability consistent with cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  These solutions may be required across the DHS Infrastructure, to include, but not limited to, the following operational areas: Data Center, Help Desk and Field Support Services (e.g., Desk-side support and LAN Administration), Network and Security Operations, and Collaboration Services (e.g, E-mail, Voice, and Video Services).  This functional category includes the full range of O&M solutions, from maintaining and upgrading individual pieces of hardware and software to full managed service solutions.  (FC3) Independent Test, Validation, Verification, and Evaluation.  As ordered, the contractor shall provide the full range of independent test, validation, verification, and evaluation solutions to ensure that all IT products and services meet DHS standards, and are performing to defined design, cost, schedule and performance specifications/capabilities.  The contractor shall provide best practices, technologies, tools, and support to quality and operational assessments, integration testing and system test and evaluation, including security certification and accreditation, for IT systems.  The contractor shall also provide independent verification and validation through the monitoring and evaluation of projects through activities such as, but not limited to, assessments, process and procedure audits, project and performance management, and systems analysis and design.  (FC4) Software Development. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of software design and development including deployment to ensure DHS applications and databases will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives.  These efforts include the full range of software design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, coding and testing, production, deployment, implementation, integration, and software application maintenance.  (FC5) Management Support Services. The contractor shall provide, as ordered, the full range of business and technical management services that assist in the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of policies, procedures, guidelines, and directives.  These documents and guidance will allow DHS to comply with the requirements of law and legislation, and operate the enterprise in an efficient and effective manner.  These services encompasses all areas of IT policy and planning including, but not limited to, enterprise architecture, security, training, enterprise resource management, business process reengineering, IT transformation and strategy, organizational change leadership, and enterprise and program management office support (e.g. business case development and performance management).  

The contract-level service descriptions are intended to provide sufficient scope and flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.  Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the task order level.  The EAGLE contracts will be technology neutral in order to keep pace as new technologies, standards, policies and procedures are identified. 

The EAGLE procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts. One solicitation will be issued that includes two separate and distinct source selections, one unrestricted and one set-aside for small business.  Vendors will be allowed to propose on one, any or all of the functional categories.  Source Selections for both unrestricted and set-aside contracts will be conducted at the functional service category level.  EAGLE contracts will be awarded to vendors in the functional service categories for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government.  Proposal requirements will emphasize qualifications rather than technical solutions.  The following factors will be used for award: past performance; quality awards and certifications; program management and quality control program; ability to recruit, train and retain high quality personnel; knowledge and understanding of DHS; small business participation (unrestricted track only); and pricing.  The numbers of contract awards in the functional service categories for the unrestricted and set-asides will be sufficient to maintain adequate competition for task orders at the functional services category level.  Prospective vendors are advised that only a limited number of the most highly qualified large and small business prime contractors in each functional category will be selected for award.  Vendors who do not meet that standard are strongly advised to seek subcontracting and/or mentor protege opportunities rather than submit prime contractor proposals.  

The unrestricted portion will include goals for subcontracting with Small, 8(a), Women-Owned, HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns.  If applicable, offerors will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR Part 19.  EAGLE will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition (unrestricted), as well as set-asides for small business in all functional categories.  Proposed goals will be addressed as an evaluation factor in the selection of the unrestricted awardees.  Additionally, evaluation sub-factors will be included for prime contractor participation in the DHS Mentor-Protégé’ program and small disadvantaged business participation.  Further information regarding subcontracting and mentor-protege opportunities can be found by www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness.  The website provides a detailed description of the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program and provides an application to apply for it.  Processing time is 10 calendar days.  Teaming arrangements are also encouraged.  For the set-aside portion, only small businesses will be considered for prime contract award.  NAICS codes will be used at the Functional Category level.  The NAICS codes and size standards are as follows: (FC1) NAICS 541512 (FC2) 541513 and 811212 (FC3) 541512 (FC4) 541511 and 518210 (FC5) 541611.  The size standard for FC5 is $6M, all others are $21M.  

EAGLE contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, T&M, etc.) and will allow for various incentive contracting features.  Specific program or project requirements will be defined in task orders that will be competed at the functional service category level.  Task orders will be competed using the Fair Opportunity provisions of the FAR.  EAGLE contracts will have a five year base and two one-year option periods. Individual tasks will have their own delivery or performance period requirements and will be allowed to run up to 24 months beyond the term of the contract.  EAGLE will allow for task order performance at any location in the United States (CONUS) or outside the US (OCONUS).  IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250.  This amount is intended to provide consideration for the IDIQ award.  The scope of the contracts and the limited number of awards will provide each vendor with adequate opportunities to receive task orders.  

The Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, invites those interested in hearing senior DHS procurement and IT officials as they provide an overview of their strategies and perspectives on both Department-wide and Component initiatives. A "DHS Industry Day" is scheduled for Tuesday, August 16, 2005 from 9:00 AM - 12:00 noon at the Ronald Reagan Auditorium in Washington, DC. This event will bring together government and industry for the first DHS informational session.  To register, please visit www.actgov.org/OpenRegistration.  Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and a maximum of only two representatives from each company will be allowed. More information regarding the EAGLE and First Source programs can be found at:  www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. There is no registration fee associated with attending this event.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail confirming their attendance of the Industry Day session.  

The Industry Day will include a limited summary briefing on EAGLE. Two subsequent Pre-proposal Conferences, one of which will be limited to small businesses, will be conducted within ten calendar days of final RFP release and will be announced via FedBizOpps.  Due to the anticipated level of interest, the Contracting Officer will not entertain requests for vendor visitations or marketing calls.  

It is anticipated that the EAGLE RFP will be released in early-September 2005 with contract awards in early CY2006.  The draft EAGLE RFP is posted with this synopsis.  Written comments received at dhseagle@dhs.gov on or before August 26, 2005 will be considered for inclusion in the final EAGLE RFP, however, the Government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions at this time.  

Further information regarding EAGLE, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, and vendor questions/EAGLE responses related to the final EAGLE RFP, when posted, will be released to the public through the FedBizOpps  and the DHS.gov website.  Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to dhseagle@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source procurement with Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Office of Sponsored Programs, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA 30332 under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b) for follow-on work. In order to perform this work the contractor must meet the following requirements: The Contractor must have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in information technology and knowledge based methods; The Contractor must be familiar with the AP210 standard with practical experience with its use in: thermal analysis, design optimization, and component bonding analysis in electronic packaging; Advanced collaborative engineering environments; PCB stackup design; PCB warpage analysis; and Printed Wiring Board (PWB) Warpage Analysis Framework (PWAF). Additionally, the contractor must have worked on at least three separate AP210 based projects and have published at least one article on board warpage using the AP210 standard; have knowledge of constrained objects (COBs), multi representational architectures (MRA) for CAD CAE interoperability, and context-based analysis models (CBAMs); and must be familiar with the prototype board warpage tool developed. The purpose of this work is to examine how other printed circuit board design variations can result in board warpage (regardless of warpage idealization levels). Aspects such as plating sequences, solder mask types, and sequential lamination groups shall be examined and captured from the stackup design and stored into AP210 files. This data shall then be used to model how these aspects can result in board warpage. This is a continuation of work completed in a previous order; it is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded. Any interested party may submit, in writing, a detailed capability statement to respond to this requirement. However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center on behalf of the Access Board, intends to negotiate a simplified acquisition via issuance of a purchase order to the Institute of Transport Engineers (ITE), 1099 14th Street NW #300 West, Washington DC 2005.  The Access Board is a Federal Agency that develops and maintains accessibility requirements that entities with responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act must meet.  In July 2004, the Access Board contracted with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) to conduct an invitation-only workshop involving geometric design and signal engineers, orientation and mobility professionals, consumers, researchers, and regulators on October 22 and 23, 2004.  Attendees heard presentations from national and international experts and then worked in several study groups to develop standard intersection plans to optimize way-finding cues.  
Recommendations included the further development of sketches and way-finding details based upon intersection corner radius, consideration of signalized and unsignalized crossings, and comparisons of attached and separated sidewalk conditions.  Attendees indicated their interest in pursuing discussions toward consensus on a range of issues and intersection types and supported the establishment of a password-protected listserv for the circulation and review of additional drawings.  Other recommendations included presentations on workshop deliberations at key industry regional and national meetings.

The Access Board wishes to further industry consideration of ways to optimize way-finding design within industry practice by contracting with the same ITE team to develop workshop schematics into common design and engineering schemes that can be reviewed and discussed online by workshop participants and others whose input may be useful.  

In consultation with Access Board staff, ITE shall oversee the follow-up to the Way-finding Workshop, establishing and managing a limited listserv and obtaining the drawings and details that will be the principal subject of its discussion.  ITE shall maintain the list serve until its members agree that consensus on document standardization has been achieved and shall report on this outcome in a future article in the ITE Journal.   

The Access Board wishes to extend its work with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) for this project.  The Institute of Transportation Engineers is the only professional association of roadway design, engineering, and operations professionals; its membership is the audience the Board must involve in any consideration of these issues.  ITE conducted the Way-finding Workshop on behalf of the Board and has ready access to professional expertise needed for this follow-up phase.  

ITE regularly works in collaboration with industry organizations such as the Federal Highway Administration, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the American Public Works Association (APWA), and others whose representatives will be involved in the Workshop.  Their access to the intended audience, their experience in conducting several focused member list serves, and their ability to disseminate findings to engineers who must understand and implement change make ITE uniquely qualified to conduct this project.   Additionally, ITE has agreed to final consensus recommendations to its website and to publish an article in the ITE Journal describing the process and illustrating recommended schemes for its readership of highway engineers.  The ITE press is the principal non-governmental source for industry technical guidance and publications.

 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt-Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than August 22, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference ABA-02010-05-0054 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and issued to ITE for these services.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Space Based Infrared Technology Branch (AFRL/VSSS), at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors for the Imaging Spectrometer Focal Plane Array (ISFPA) program. The intent of this program is to posture the DOD for current and future-generation hyperspectral sensing applications by developing a single, multipurpose, high performance, large format array that operates simultaneously in the Visible and Short Wavelength Infrared (VIS-SWIR).  The Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor unique concept has been structured to address constraints and complexities imposed by current generation Sensor Chip Assembly (SCA) technology.  The Government anticipates that the combined value of Task 1, 2, and 3, with the potential for multiple awards, will be between $3 and $6 Million and will be accomplished within a two year time frame.  The ceiling for the entire effort, all tasks and including multiple awards is estimated at $9.7 Million.  The driving goal for this program is to deliver initial “flight-grade” arrays for insertion into a demonstration system within two years from contract award.  AFRL/VSSS is pursuing a 4-phase (via task orders) approach to the delivery of the ISFPAs from concept to development of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration arrays:  Task 1 will comprise the preliminary design addressing HSI unique priorities.  Task 2 will be the development to the Critical Design Review (CDR).  Task 3 will be the fabrication of two (2) engineering and two (2) “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.  Task 4 will consist of the production of additional “flight-grade” SCAs. 
B. Current technology shortfalls limit air-borne and space-borne tactical system design options, impose collection and post-collection processing complexities, and limit achievable performance metrics.  System designers must accept reduced swath widths or sizeable dead zones associated with butting arrays or implement complex pointing maneuvers to achieve coverage requirements.  Coupled with the desire for large-format arrays is the need to successfully operate over a wide dynamic range.  The dynamic range constraints could be partially addressed by providing a wide range of variable frame times as well as by recognizing that scene irradiance varies significantly over the spectral band opening the door to variable conversion gains across the spectral dimension of the SCA.  High pixel operability is yet another critical parameter.  Therefore, in summary, the Government has identified four (4) critical technology advances for this program: (1) the hybridization of high-yield, large format arrays with minimal dead zones, (2) the development of next generation read out integrated circuit (ROIC) designs compatible with large format arrays incorporating on-chip  Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC), (3) ROIC designs for high frame rate conditions and high linearity over a large dynamic range, and (4) the development of high-performance, VIS-SWIR SCAs addressing operational and storage-life constraints.  Desired features of this SCA include operation in the visible through short-wave infrared spectral bands, programmable frame time, programmable conversion gain, large format, and on-chip ADC.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to contact the technical POC to verify interest in the effort to be proposed as well as to obtain the program specific goals (provided in a separate document).  The contractor will investigate methodologies, which include designing and/or processing of detector arrays and ROICs to improve performance and radiation tolerance based on the goals provided.  A minimum of two (2) flight-grade and two (2) engineering-grade SCAs are expected as deliverables to AFRL as a result of this program.  This program may include delivery of additional SCA deliverables (this is a potential task order number 4).

C. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards using Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts consisting of tasks for preliminary design (Task 1), detailed critical design (Task 2), fabrications of engineering and “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs (Task 3), and possibly additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs as a potential task order number 4.  Up to three (3) contract awards may be made depending on the quality of the proposals received and funds available.

Task 1: The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Contract for Task 1.  Task 1 will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract’s guaranteed minimum order requirement.  Task 1 is anticipated to be a four (4) month effort to accomplish the preliminary design of the technical goals.  Initial proposals shall include substantiation of specialized experience.  The exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that overall program cost, schedule and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into further levels of development.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 2 is anticipated to develop the detailed design of the VIS-SWIR ISFPA.  The overall goal of this task will be to mature the design to the critical design level addressing the technical goals of the program. Again the exit criteria for this task will include providing supporting evidence that program cost, schedule, and risk are at an acceptable level to proceed into fabrication, demonstration, and test.  Risk mitigation factors for successfully accomplishing Task 3 must also be addressed.

Task 3 is anticipated to address the fabrication and testing of ISFPAs.  The overall goal of this task will be to fabricate two (2) engineering SCAs and two (2) demonstration SCAs.  

Task 4 is anticipated to fabricate additional “flight-grade” demonstration SCAs.

D. A separate in-depth description of the goals of this effort is available upon request.  Because of ITAR requirements, all requests for goals must be accompanied by a copy of the DD 2345 or JCP confirmation number.  The goals will then be sent to the address of record on the DD 2345.  Design parameter goals have been categorized as A, B, or C priorities based upon relative importance to Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) sensor goals and objectives.  Category A parameters represents the highest priority.  Categories B and C may be traded for lower risk, cost, and/or improved performance.  Offerors should review and respond to all of the goals, with greater emphasis given to the higher priority items. Offerors should structure their program such that risks of attaining the goals are minimized with respect to yield, cost, and schedule.  All requests for information shall be directed to AFRL/PKVS by contacting Mr. Wayne Zitzka, at email wayne.zitzka@kirtland.af.mil, or via phone at (505)-846-4987.

<DESC>Request For Proposal (RFP) Number: DOL059RP20078,
Amendment Number 0001. The purpose of this amendment number 0001 to this RFP is to provide a response or clarification as follows:

1.  The solicitation (Section I, incorporation of FAR 52.219-17) and accompanying letter (directly under underlined, blue-bold print) both refer to 8a’s – as this is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, what is the relevance of the 8a references?

Response:  The term or phase, 8(a) is DELETED from this RFP in it’s entirety.

2.  Regarding the evaluation criteria, which is more important or more heavily weighted?  

Response: 	No response.

3.  Submission requirements have verbiage for both electronic and hard copy, but seem to always require some hard copies, is that correct?

Response: 	No response.  

4.  Is this a Base plus three years or Base plus four years (C.10)? 
C.10.	Period of Performance: 
The period of performance is from contract award through the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2006). This contract will have three (3) option years for the contractor.  The contracting officer will notify the contractor 90 days prior to the end of each contracting year pertaining to the renewal of the next option year.   
Response: 	This section of the RFP and SOW is amended and change as follows:
C.10.	Period of Performance:  Base Year and Three (3) Option Years Combined. The period of performance is from contract award for one (1) year (BASE YEAR). Also, this contract will have three (3) option years.  The contracting officer will notify the contractor 60 days prior to the end of each contracting year pertaining to the renewal of the next or any option year.   

5.  Are the four full-time equivalents referred to in para C.2 and C.1.4.c the same four people?  

Response:  	The contact recruits two people for safety and health individuals and two for worker compensation; this would be four FTEs and should be the same four people referred to throughout the RFP.

Are these four expected to fill all requirements of this contract?

Response:  	Yes

6.  Are the “on call experts” referred to in C.1.4.c.20 the same four as referred to in C.1.4.c/C.2?  In this instance, what is the government’s definition of “on call”?

Response:	Additional staff (over and above the four FTEs referenced in the RFP and SOW) that can be called upon for additional support- such serious accident investigations.

7.  Please specify which requirements result in this being classified as a “Major Acquisition”. 

Response:  	This item is deleted from this RFP in it’s entirety.

8.  Paragraph C.18, Definitions, states that “Major systems as defined below are considered ‘major acquisitions’.  Major acquisitions are subject to the requirements of OMB Circular A-11, Part 7, Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition and Management of Capital Assets.”  There is no accompanying definition of ‘Major systems’. 

Response:  	This item is deleted from this RFP in it’s entirety.

To what does this paragraph refer?   

Response: 	This item is deleted from this RFP in it’s entirety.

Specifically which Capital Assets are covered under this procurement?

Response: 	No response.

9.  Would the government be willing to delete the requirement for an Earned Value Management System? 

Response: 	This item is deleted from this RFP in it’s entirety.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond intends to acquire Covers through the use of long-term contracts awarded against solicitation SP0412-05-R-2656.  This solicitation is comprised of Government identified groupings of NSNs consisting of 72 individual line items.  The Government will separately evaluate and award each group rather than evaluate and award on a per line item basis.  Assuming the Government receives one or more offers for each group, the Government will evaluate the offers on the basis of the Total Group Price (TGP).

The contracts will have a twenty four month base period and three twelve-month option periods for total maximum period of performance of 5 years if all options are exercised.  The NSNs in this solicitation all fall under FSC’s 1560 & 1620.  Once released (see issue date below) the solicitation will be found at http://www2.dscr.dla.mil/externalweb/UserWeb/FAGA/index.html and on the procurement gateway.  There are drawings associated with some of the NSNs covered by this acquisition.  In order to obtain access to drawings, offerors must be registered on the DSCR Technical Data Management Division website.  It is suggested that vendors who are not already registered access the following web-site to register prior to release of the solicitation http://www.dscr.dla.mil/tdmd/mb_index.asp.   The solicitation will be issued on 31 August May 2005 and close on 30 Sep 2005.  Documents will not be available until the solicitation issue date.

<DESC>INVENTION SUMMARY: The Idaho National Laboratory has developed and patented a highly reproducible laser beam scanning device for an internal source laser desorption microprobe Fourier transform mass spectrometer.   It utilizes a unique external laser scanning mechanism for an internal source LD-FTMS. This mechanism provides adjustable resolution enhancement so that spatial resolution at the target is not limited to that of the stepper motors at the light source, approximately 5 µm/step! The realized spatial resolution is a combination of the scanning resolution and the desorption spot size employed.  Scanning resolution control, where the beam is located, is less than 0.5 µm depending on the stepper motor used.  Laser beam spot control is dependent on focusing optics, which varies between 20 and 2 µm depending on arrangement and lens used. The scanning mechanism employs a virtual source that is wavelength independent up to the final focusing lens, which can be controlled remotely to account for focal length dependence on wavelength. A binary index provides an automatic alignment feature. The virtual source is located 9 feet from the sample.  It is completely outside of the vacuum system and beyond the 50 G line of the fringing magnetic field. To eliminate reproducibility problems associated with vacuum pump vibrations, the system takes advantage of the magnetic field inherent to the FTMS to utilize Lenz’s law for vibrational dampening. The LD-FTMS microprobe has exceptional reproducibility which enables successive mapping sequences for depth-profiling studies.  A functional system is available for demonstrations.
Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith.  A potential licensing opportunity exists with BEA, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

<SUBJECT>A -- Solid Alkylation Catalyst Regeneration

<DESC>Researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have developed a technology to enable the efficient use of solid acid catalysts in the alkylation of isoparaffins with olefins.  This technology provides for the regeneration of a solid acid catalyst with Supercritical fluids (SCF).  Solid catalysts are relatively harmless and pose far less risk to workers and the environment as compared to liquid acid catalysts.  However, their vulnerability to fouling has generally limited their activity to three to five hours.  INL researchers have developed a process that extends solid catalyst activity to up to nine days, or as much as a 7,000 percent improvement over normal catalyst activity.  The novel INL technology could enable industries to replace environmentally risky liquid acid catalyzed processes currently in use.   

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing these technologies.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with some or all of the funding support being provided by industrial partner(s) interested in commercializing the technology.  The INL has a patent and patents pending on this technology.  See U.S. Patent Nos. 6,103,948, 6,887,813, and 6,579,821, and Patent Application Nos. 10/613,719 and 10/986,742.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before August 31, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact David Anderson:

This initial Screening Information Request (SIR) represents a Request for Information (RFI) (SIR/RFI No. 1) that will enable the FAA to make a screening decision to determine the firms that possess special standards of responsibility that would enable them to perform the required services.  The FAA reserves the right to add vendors and/or other sources which meet the special standards of responsibility criteria and have performed satisfactorily on previous procurements.  Accordingly, it has been determined that only firms currently possessing the special standards of responsibility as set forth at "a" through "e" below will be permitted to advance to the second phase of the screening process.  The second phase will be a Request for Offer (RFO) and will be designated SIR/RFO No. 2. Special Standards of Responsibility: 	a.  Vendor demonstrates an understanding of the requirement (Ref. Statement of Work, Attachment 1) and possesses the necessary expertise and capabilities. 	b.  Vendor has successfully implemented at least two PMOs within the last four years. 	c.  Vendor has successfully implemented at least one PMO of similar size and scope within the last four years. 	d.  At least one member of vendor's proposed project team has implemented a PMO of similar size and scope and that person is Project Management Professional (PMP) certified. 	e.  Vendor has knowledge of and has performed at least one "Organizational Project Maturity Model" (OPM3) assessment for a previous client.  An offeror's submittal in response to SIR/RFI No. 1 must demonstrate how the special standards of responsibility identified at "a" through "e" have been met.  For "b" and "c," the submittal must identify the company, organization, agency, etc., and point of contact by name with current phone number and e-mail address for verification purposes.  A submittal shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.  A page is defined as one side of a "sheet."  A 1-inch (all around) margin must be utilized.   The font/size must be "Times New Roman/12 pitch."   Submissions that state that the offeror understands, can, or will comply with all statements in the SOW and statements paraphrasing the SOW requirements or parts thereof, are considered insufficient.  Phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed," or "well-known techniques will be used," etc. will be considered insufficient. The requirement contemplates an indefinite-delivery/requirements type contract with a base year and includes option provisions to renew for two additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The proposed contract will incorporate AMS Clauses 3.2.4-35, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, and 3.2.4-34, Option To Extend Services. The resultant contract will employ a time-and-materials pricing arrangement, and includes the following skill categories:  (a) Program Manager, (b) Project Manager, (c) Project Support, IT Analyst, (d) Junior Project Support, IT Analyst, (e) Financial Analyst, and (f) Technical Writer. The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:00 p.m. local time, August 22, 2005.  Responses are to be e-mailed to Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov.  If all requested information is not provided in the submittal, the vendor's response may be determined as unacceptable and, therefore, not afforded further consideration.  If you have questions, contact Connie Houpt at (405) 954-7820.

Please use the information contained in this document and the format requested as the basis for your response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives to determining how to proceed with the acquisition process for the handheld devices and related services.  Industry responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions, and acquisition approaches for worldwide implementation of wireless handheld computing devices.  The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.    					

Background:

Department of State (DoS) users are increasingly mobile, intensifying the need for adequate supporting technology. By providing personnel in the field with up-to-date resources and access to key information, diplomats and other Department employees can be more productive and effective. Remote access to DoS resources must serve numerous types of usage from casual email access to the mobile worker and teleworker who require an environment similar to that at their duty station office. The use of wireless handheld computing devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (commonly known as “PDAs”), provides one mechanism for users to have compact, mobile solutions to their business information access needs.

DoS users are keenly aware of the technologies available in the market place and know that if implementation slows, the gap between capability and need widens. If the gap is allowed to widen between available resources and user needs, a far greater risk to DoS business than the perceived risk associated with remote access looms ahead. The lack of availability of up-to-date information for the mobile user can in fact, place personnel and the DoS mission in unnecessary jeopardy.

User Business Needs:

The user needs and requirements for mobile computing devices were compiled through interviews, surveys and as a result of the wired PDA (hp iPAQ Pocket PC) and wireless (BlackBerry) pilot testing in 2004. In general, most users want reliable, up-to-date, and consistent access to e-mail, calendar, and contacts. Additional requirements from users include robust access to tasks, files, memos and Internet sites through their mobile device. The purpose and value of PDAs are to insure that Department of State users have current information readily accessible in an affordable, portable, compact, and digital form which adequately ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Users will expect Department of State PDAs to have functionality as reliable and easy to use as those available “off-the-shelf” through commercial outlets.  This requirement does not support the use of non-U. S. Government (USG) devices, which cannot be connected to USG systems and networks.

Specifically, the solutions chosen should address the tiered nature of the business needs with a selection of devices providing a range of capabilities for the diverse needs of the DoS user.

User Requirements:

“MS Outlook” Type Functions

•	Provide full access to e-mail, calendar, contact and task items from the user's Microsoft Exchange profile.
•	Ensure that information is consistently synchronized between MS Exchange profiles and the mobile computing device (PDA) so that information is up to date.
•	Permit users to view, create, modify and store DoS e-mail, calendar items, contacts and tasks while away from the office.
•	Provide access to common e-mail attachments including, but not limited to, MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint and Adobe PDF files.
•	Provide Internet/Intranet web browsing from links in e-mail.

Other Functionality

•	Provide Internet/intranet web browsing from PDA.
•	Provide access to user documents and/or files that have been downloaded to the PDA.
•	Permit users to view, create, modify and store documents on the device.
•	Ensure that information is consistently synchronized between user's workstation and the PDA so that the documents/files remain current and reliable.
•	Permit users to utilize commonly-available peripherals such as printers, keyboards, external storage devices and projection devices.
•	Provide a reasonably priced solution to users stationed around the world.

Performance

•	Support maximum device storage capacity for users to manage information needed to complete business-related tasks, including standard add-on memory cards.
•	Permit quick access to stored information regardless of location. Users must be able to access and record unclassified information (only to which the user is entitled) in a reasonable timeframe during meetings and other times without overly burdensome security protocols. 
•	Provide continuous synchronization with MS Exchange profile so that new information is immediately available to the user.
•	Provide the option to synchronize with MS Exchange profiles from any workstation on OpenNet.
•	Support 24x7 resolution of technical issues in coordination with responsible systems administrator
•	Vendor managed solution

 

Technical Requirements
•	Must be COTS based (“off-the-shelf”)
•	Scalable
•	Deployable and operable worldwide
•	Centralized configuration and operations management, including:
•	Centralized security policy administration & enforcement capabilities
•	Remote lock/kill (only for wireless devices)
•	Password protection for DoS network access in accordance with Department standards
•	Multiple device types supported (wired and wireless/multiple form factors)
•	Patch management capabilities and remote configuration management services
•	Worldwide service (data and voice and equipment)
•	Available Application Programming Interface (API)

<CONTACT>Lorna M. Gunning Contracting Officer 5082260902     Lorna_Gunning@nps.gov;
<DESC>Under authority of FAR 6.302-5, the National Park Service (NPS) intends to enter into a non-competitive contract with EOS Group, Inc. to provide EOS Explorer Extended software for deployment throughout the NPS Park Facility Management Division.  Eos Explorer Extended provides a web enabled, simplified tool to navigate, create, edit, and review estimates within the Timberline Precision Cost Estimating Software.  E2x also provides for increased security of access into CESS.  E2x also uses Crystal Reporting Software as its report driver, which will allow for increased analysis of cost estimating data at all levels of the NPS.  E2x is an estimate management system and provides a much more effective and efficient method of using the NPS Cost Estimating Software System (CESS). E2x enables the user to view all estimates in a folder or across multiple folders, allowing NPS management and staff to 'see the big picture'. NPS management and staff can view estimating data including which estimators are working on estimate, track estimate status, review estimate totals (including labor, material, and markups) without opening up the estimates in CESS, and manage the contractor's estimates stored in the completed folder which are ready for review and processing. E2x provides powerful search and reporting capabilities which previously required a labor-intensive effort.  E2x streamlines the estimate creation process for NPS and CA contractor staff, introduces required fields and cleanses data, automates the review and estimate validation process, and migrates cost estimates (in mass) from CESS into FMSS.   These licenses will be distributed Service-wide for use by WASO, Regional, and Park Maintenance Staff.   The Eos Group, Inc. is intimately familiar with the Cost Estimating Software System (CESS) project.  Eos Group, Inc.'s resources were involved in the initial design, development and configuration of the Explorer Extended plug in software application which is used to support the Precision cost estimating software and CESS, so they are not only familiar with CESS and its associated software, but they are familiar with the National Park Services unique requirements.  Eos Group's  principals, designers and engineers were involved in the initial design and development of the software (TIMBERLINE) as a Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) application. Eos Group Inc. collectively has over 20 years of working for Timberline Software Corporation, the manufacturer of the software (TIMBERLINE). Eos Group, Inc.'s has an exclusive, worldwide license to portions of the software (TIMBERLINE) source code enabling Eos Group Inc. to provide technologies that fulfill unique NPS integration and work process requirements. Furthermore, Eos Group Inc. is the only authorized third-party developer of the Explorer Extended plug in application.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting descriptive literature illustrating corporate capabilities to provide the required services.  All responses received within 15 days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Questions may be e-mailed to Lorna_Gunning@nps.gov.  Telephone questions or requests will not be accepted or acknowledged.  End of Announcement.

In addition, Africare staff has supported PBT implementation by monitoring birth attendants at health facilities, working with Ministry of Health staff at the sub-prefectural level, and entering and analyzing PBT data. Africare’s experience and demonstrated skill in implementing and maintaining PBT, close working relationship with the MOH, and current responsibilities for logistical and managerial support for the Africa Integrated Malaria Initiative project make it the only contractor who can perform the necessary duties.  Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide this service described above should submit a capabilities statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the service. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

They will be able to provide information in regard the local Defense Security Service Representative for the appropriate region.  Also due to the military critical technology contained in the specifications and drawings, a completed and approved DD Form 2345, entitled Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, must accompany the contractors request for documents.   Certification under the JC! P establishes the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to receive technical data governed, in the U.S., by DoD Directive 5230.25 and, in Canada, by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TDCR). The Defense Logistics Information Service at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ is responsible for the administration and functionality of the Certification process.   Once a contractor has been provided a copy of the specification and drawing package, all further actions regarding the qualification process will be between the contractor and Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Code 622). Any qualification for manufacture of SHT Tile and Fairing Strips will be done by the contractor and will not be accomplished under a Navy contract.  The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing is currently estima! ted to be 90 days.  When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin.  Once a contractor becomes qualified, The Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, will notify NAVICP.  At that point the newly qualified firm will be included on the mailing list of any SHT Tile and Fairing Strip solicitations and will be considered for possible contract award.

<SUBJECT>A -- Mobile Networked Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MNM) Technology
<DESC>Mobile Networked Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MNM) Technology.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), regarding Mobile Networked Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MNM) technology development.  In addition to the RFI, this is also the announcement for a Workshop being sponsored by DARPA/ATO to identify new opportunities to exploit Mobile Networked Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MNM) for tactical military communications systems.  The MNM Workshop will be held at George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, on September 14, 2005 at 3401 North Fairfax Drive, Room 329, Arlington, VA 22201 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m. and the MNM Workshop will commence at 9:00 a.m.

This RFI and Workshop are open to any capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to universities, private or public companies, Government Laboratories, and Government research establishments.  Respondents are advised that DARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this Request for Information (RFI) or the Workshop.
NOTE: Responding to this RFI does not require participation in the Workshop.

Objectives and Description of Mobile Networked Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MNM) Technology. Recent developments show Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) technology to be immensely promising in a wide range of military applications.  DARPA seeks to convert the potential demonstrated in the first phase of the current DARPA MNM program into practical military systems that exploit the adaptability of MIMO capable systems for both vehicular and handheld applications.  Toward that end, DARPA seeks to identify technologies that will result in a system of communications devices and software that are built from the ground-up to support the requirements and potential flexibility of a MNM enabled network.  The system should be able to intelligently adapt all of its radio and processing resources to support the user’s communications needs.  These adaptations should include, but are not limited to: spatial diversity for higher data rates, spatial diversity for low power spectral density, spatial diversity to increase range, frequency agility, bandwidth agility, interference suppression, beam forming, and multiple simultaneous beams.  Additionally, the system must support a tactically relevant network implementation that can also adapt as the environment and mission change.  DARPA also seeks to explore the synergy of MNM technologies with advanced spectrum access and management approaches such as those being researched in the DARPA Next Generation (XG) Communications Program.

The DARPA vision is that MNM technologies will become the foundation of the physical layer for a new generation of communications devices, purpose-built for a dynamic networked system.  The objective is to explore and develop MNM technologies that enhance the war fighter’s capability.  This workshop seeks to foster the exchange of information and encourage thought about the potential of MNM enabled systems.  We also hope to develop a set of metrics through which we can understand the impact of MNM development and measure our progress towards our objective.  

Information sought:
System concepts and ideas for innovative technology development being sought include, but are not limited to, areas such as:

•	Concepts and technology to reduce the size/weight and prime power requirements for MNM device implementations
•	Concepts and technology to significantly improve spectral efficiency (bits/sec/Hz) 
•	Concepts and technology that explore the flexibility of a MNM system to adapt to mission requirements
•	Concepts and technology that explore the possibilities of scalability of MNM technology
•	Concepts and technology that explore the network and how it could be designed and react when using MNM

RFI Instructions to Responders:
This announcement is a request for white papers and input to the workshop in support of developing innovative and creative approaches to pursue the goals of the development of MNM technologies.  The white paper responses are encouraged to include, but are not limited to, as many as possible of the above identified attributes of MNM technology, the technical approach, system integration techniques, hardware implementation details (size/weight/power), and metrics that can be expected to be achieved and demonstrated. 

You are encouraged to submit white papers that discuss your solution or technology that will fulfill the objectives for this program.  White papers should consist of:  a) one page cover that identifies the title, organization, responder’s technical and administrative points of contact - include name(s), address(es), phone(s) and fax numbers, and email addresses, b) a two page executive summary, and c) eight pages of technical and programmatic information.  The total page count should be no longer than 10 pages (excluding the cover page).  There is no need for a budget estimate for this white paper.  White papers should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings, such as "Company Proprietary.”  Markings such as "Company Confidential" or other phrases that could be confused with national security classifications shall be avoided.  

The Government anticipates that responses to this RFI will be unclassified.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Universal Armament Interface (UAI)
<DESC>The Universal Armament Interface (UAI) Government team is seeking comments/inputs from Industry on the UAI Platform-to-Store Interface Control Document (PSICD) that is currently being developed by the UAI Consortium.  The UAI PSICD documents a generic interface between Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) and platforms.  The PSICD currently includes the functionality requirements for existing legacy and future PGM weapons.  The intent is to also look towards the future (10 years ahead) and to capture, to the best of our ability, the functionality requirements for PGM weapons that are currently being planned or those that we can reasonably envision.  The Air Force is specifically seeking inputs on functionality requirements for moving targets, seekers, data links (initialization, on aircraft and release) and geo-specificity (exclusion zones) but welcomes input on other requirements that Industry believes may not be sufficiently addressed in the PSICD.  Industry input is crucial to ensure the final PSICD captures the future functionality requirements that Industry believes is necessary for their future PGM weapon concepts.  As directed by ACC/DR and AAC/CC, the UAI PSICD will be the interface for future PGM weapons, and future PGM weapon designs must comply with the ICD.  This is the opportunity to ensure that the PSICD is robust enough to accommodate future PGM weapon functionality for at least the next 10 years.  The PSICD will be implemented on Air Force platforms and weapons beginning with F-15E, Suite 6, the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) MK-82 and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)

Industry representatives willing to provide comments/inputs to the UAI PSICD should contact Audrea Feist, Deputy UAI lead, at (850) 883-3080 or audrea.feist@eglin.af.mil.
A copy of the UAI PSICD will be provided to the representatives for their review.  On Thursday, 18 August 2005, the UAI government team will host a meeting at Eglin AFB in Bldg 349, Room 301, beginning at 8:00.  A general session will be held from 8:00 – 9:30 followed by 1 hour individual sessions for interested companies.  Interested companies may contact Ms. Feist to schedule individual sessions.  For those companies not interested in attending the meeting on the 18th, comments may be emailed to Ms. Feist at the address above or mailed to the following address:  AAC/XRS, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 301, Eglin AFB FL 32542 .

<SUBJECT>A -- NANO AIR VEHICLE (NAV) PROGRAM DARPA PROPOSERS' DAY WORKSHOP
<DESC>NANO AIR VEHICLE (NAV) PROGRAM, DARPA PROPOSERS’ DAY WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT, SN05-36.  DARPA’s Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) Program is a technology development and integration program to demonstrate the capability to develop an extremely small (<5 cm), ultra-lightweight (<10g) air vehicle capable of both hover and forward flight while carrying a 2 gram pay-load.  These systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in providing ISR capability with minimal potential for detection in a wide range of operational environments including jungle, grassland, desert, arctic, and urban.  (Development or integration of payload sensor technologies is NOT a component of this Program)   DARPA believes that the desired performance characteristics can be achieved by the combination of innovative design, development and integration of existing and developmental technologies, resulting in a UAV that will provide a militarily useful function. Examples of technologies of interest include, but are not limited, to the following: power sources for propulsion, design of lifting surfaces, multifunctional component design, vehicle integration, etc.  Only those designs meeting minimum standards, expected to be set forth in an expected Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), will be considered.  These standards include, but are not limited to: a) maximum GTOW of 10 grams (with a reserved payload fraction of 2 grams); b) maximum dimension in any direction of 5 cm; c) fast forward speed of 7 to 10 meters/sec; d) slow forward speed of 0.5 meter/sec; e) range greater than 1000 meters at 7 to 10 meters/sec for-ward velocity; f) the ability to transition to the slow forward speed of 0.5 meter/sec after completing the 1000 meter high speed ingress and maintain the slow speed for >60 seconds; and g) the ability to hover in place for >60 seconds after completing a 1000 high speed meter ingress and the 60 second low speed ingress.   The program will be divided into two phases: 1) Subsystem Design & Evaluation and Preliminary Integrated Design, and 2) Comprehensive Design, Integration, Test, and Evaluation. The initial dissemination of information on this initiative will be a Program Proposers’ Day on Thursday, September 29, 2005.  The goals of this meeting are threefold: 1) To familiarize participants with DARPA’s interest in cutting edge Nano Air Vehicle technology, 2) identify potential bidders and promote their understanding of the goals of the effort, and 3) promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  It is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop competitive responses to any potential forthcoming DARPA BAA and any subsequent solicitations.  While such solicitations are expected, there is no guarantee that any will be forthcoming. The Proposers’ Day will be held at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA  22201.  An $80.00 registration fee is required to cover the cost of the meeting.  Pre-registration is required by September 26, 2005, for workshop attendance.  DARPA will not provide cost reimbursement for workshop attendance.  The workshop will be unclassified and open to all potential bidders.  Attendance is limited to three representatives per organization and is not required to propose to any subsequent BAAs or research solicitations that may be issued on this topic.  Registration for the Proposers’ Day begins at 8:00 AM (EST), followed by the morning session at 9:00 AM (EST).  This session will include the introduction of the DARPA NAV Program and Invited Presentations addressing state-of-the-art foundation technologies.  The Afternoon Session will begin at approximately 1:00 PM continuing with invited presentations, followed by interactive teaming discussions ending NLT 4:30 PM.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

Interpreter/Facilitator
SABIT Regional 1 Program

I.	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Since 1990, SABIT (Special American Business Internship Training Program) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) has provided market and business training to professionals from Eurasia. Providing a unique opportunity to facilitate cross-border cooperation with Eurasia, SABIT helps American organizations form relationships with potential customers, distributors, or partners, who can assist in facilitating profitable international transactions. As relationships of mutual trust are the most significant aspect of interactions between partners in joint ventures, contractual arrangements, or business relations in Eurasia, the linkages formed through SABIT serve as a basis for new business development, and often lead to tangible results. The Interpreter/Facilitator is an integral part of the SABIT team, interpreting and facilitating training sessions and meetings with U.S. organizations as part of the specialized industry programs sponsored and financed by SABIT, in addition to serving as a resource and emergency contact for participants from Eurasia outside of meetings and training sessions.

II.	STATEMENT OF NEED

The SABIT program has a requirement for two (2) Expert/Consultant’s who shall provide interpretation and facilitation services (hereunto defined as “Interpreter/Facilitator”).  The Interpreter/Facilitator shall provide interpretation and facilitation services for the scheduled program meetings each day for each program session. Each session consists of 29 consecutive working days. There will be two program sessions for each requirement outlined in this statement of work.

STATEMENT OF WORK
SABIT Regional 2 Program

I.	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Since 1990, SABIT (Special American Business Internship Training Program) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) has provided market and business training to professionals from Eurasia. Providing a unique opportunity to facilitate cross-border cooperation with Eurasia, SABIT helps American organizations form relationships with potential customers, distributors, or partners, who can assist in facilitating profitable international transactions. As relationships of mutual trust are the most significant aspect of interactions between partners in joint ventures, contractual arrangements, or business relations in Eurasia, the linkages formed through SABIT serve as a basis for new business development, and often lead to tangible results. The Interpreter/Facilitator is an integral part of the SABIT team, interpreting and facilitating training sessions and meetings with U.S. organizations as part of the specialized industry programs sponsored and financed by SABIT, in addition to serving as a resource and emergency contact for participants from Eurasia outside of meetings and training sessions.

II.	STATEMENT OF NEED

The SABIT program has a requirement for two (2) Expert/Consultant’s who shall provide interpretation and facilitation services (hereunto defined as “Interpreter/Facilitator”).

Each session consists of 29 consecutive working days. There will be three program sessions for each requirement outlined in this statement of work.

STATEMENT OF WORK
SABIT Regional 3 Program


I.	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Since 1990, SABIT (Special American Business Internship Training Program) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) has provided market and business training to professionals from Eurasia. Providing a unique opportunity to facilitate cross-border cooperation with Eurasia, SABIT helps American organizations form relationships with potential customers, distributors, or partners, who can assist in facilitating profitable international transactions. As relationships of mutual trust are the most significant aspect of interactions between partners in joint ventures, contractual arrangements, or business relations in Eurasia, the linkages formed through SABIT serve as a basis for new business development, and often lead to tangible results. The Interpreter/Facilitator is an integral part of the SABIT team, interpreting and facilitating training sessions and meetings with U.S. organizations as part of the specialized industry programs sponsored and financed by SABIT, in addition to serving as a resource and emergency contact for participants from Eurasia outside of meetings and training sessions.

II.	STATEMENT OF NEED

The SABIT program has a requirement for an Expert/Consultant who shall provide interpretation and facilitation services (hereunto defined as “Interpreter/Facilitator”).  The Interpreter/Facilitator shall provide interpretation and facilitation services for the scheduled program meetings each day for each program session. Each session consists of 29 consecutive working days. There will be three program sessions for each requirement outlined in this statement of work.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

After three years of negotiations, Sudan's government and main rebel group in Southern Sudan (Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army - SPLM/A) signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9, 2005 to end more than 21 years of civil war.  But as Khartoum makes peace on one front, another violent conflict persists in Western Sudan.

Open warfare erupted in Darfur in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked military installations.  The rebels, who seek an end to the region's chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias ("Jingaweit") recruited among groups of Arabic extraction.  Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings, and massive displacement.

The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the first order.  According to the UN's Humanitarian Profile (# 9 - dated Dec. 1, 2004) an estimated 2.39 million people are displaced out of a population of 6.5 million within Darfur, and more than 200,000 have crossed the border into neighboring Chad.

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is heavily engaged in addressing this ongoing humanitarian crisis.  In FY 2004, USAID provided more than $186 million in support of humanitarian programs in Darfur, Sudan.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) plays a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.

<DESC>Question and Answer
Note: FBO was not able to upload the picture as attachement, please reach Lt President  707 424 7770 with your fax number if you wish for the picure. Thanks


1.  Do you need a steerable axle trailer?  The question is related to the requirement for 90 degree turn radius. 
2.  Will the trailer be used on pavement (runway) or off road over rough terrain?
3.  Why is the trailer extra-wide?  What will it carry?
4.  What is a "rocking front bolster?"
# 1 yes it needs to be 90degree turn radius on front axle.
# 2 mostly pavement and flight line (taxiways, runways)and in shop areas, some gravel areas wherever needed
# 3 it is wide due to our requirement is for the C-5 cargo aircraft the largest plane in the inventory, components of this aircraft
# 4 A rocking center pivot point of the front axle that allows the wheels to turn at 90 degrees and remain on the ground. 

1) What size Rumber Planks are required? 
2) Are there specific positions on the trailer that need to be accessed from below more easily? Where? 
3) Is the front axle to be shorter in width? If so, how much? 
4) Is a two individual front axle 90 degree steering solution desired? If so would 4 front wheels be acceptable with steering at each pair? 
5) Is there any concentrated load points on the trailer? 
6) What additional accessories or storage for Basic Equipment will be accommodated? 
7) When will be the delivery deadline? 

#1 The picture should have answered this and so did my description the size of the planks are what is required to meet the requirement 2”x 8” and 13’ 6” long spaced to have 18 inches between them yet have one at each end of the trailer. 
#2 Everywhere the planks are not (everywhere possible)
#3 no
#4 ?  This agency does not want four wheels on the front
#5 not primarily however it may carry items not the full length of the trailer and this would cause a load to be placed center of trailer
#6 primarily items fro tie down and needed items for safety 
#7 ASAP this is a question for you LT but before 30 Sept is what I am expecting.

5. 		Project Descriptions and Profile

The Bulgarian State Agency for Civil Protection (CPA) requested USTDA’s assistance to establish an Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS) in Bulgaria.  The project is the result of a very successful USTDA-funded Orientation Visit, led by Minister Filiz Husmenova, the head of the Bulgarian CPA. USTDA provided a grant to the CPA in the amount of $291,340 for a feasibility study to develop an IEMS and a Phase II pilot project in the Plovdiv Municipality to demonstrate the IEMS network design.  The grant was signed in April 2005, and the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the feasibility study was issued in June and closed on July 11, 2005.  The CPA received a total of six proposals to complete the feasibility study.   While the CPA has a knowledgeable selection committee, the CPA would like to assure that they select the most technically qualified contractor on the basis of the award criteria posted in the RFP, and therefore, has requested technical and procedural assistance to make their selection.
 
The original award criteria for the IEMS Phase I Feasibility Study as listed in the RFP is as follows: 

1.

Project Background

Bulgaria’s emergency management system, referred to as the  “Civil Protection” system, is civilian-led, based on laws and executive orders, and is an all-hazards system.  The Bulgarian Council of Ministers has established a “Standing Committee on the Protection of the Population in the Cases of Disasters and Accidents,” reporting to the Prime Minister.  The working body of this Standing Committee is the State Agency for Civil Protection (CPA), which is responsible for coordinating Bulgaria’s national strategy for emergency management.  The Standing Committee and the State Agency connect the four levels of civil protection activity: national; regional; municipal; and peripheral.  

The CPA has established 14 teams for emergency-rescue activities at the regional civil protection directorates, with a staff of some four hundred personnel deployed in 55 rescue teams, with rotating shifts providing continuous rescue and emergency medical coverage.

Project Description

While considerable organizational structure and staffing already exists at the local and regional levels — local police and firefighting agencies, diving and alpine rescue teams, emergency medical agencies and the like — the CPA seeks to develop an IEMS to coordinate emergency response activities on the local, regional, and national levels.  The CPA proposes to develop the architecture for the IEMS and design a pilot project in the Plovdiv municipality to demonstrate the IEMS.   The proposed pilot would create a plan for cooperation among all governmental organizations (fire, police, rescue and others).  Cooperative efforts would be focused particularly on mutual sharing of databases, as well as the development of networks to permit real-time sharing of information during a crisis.  A Regional Emergency Center (REC) would be established to coordinate the various activities.  This center would be both a clearinghouse of information through a dedicated Internet portal and database exchange, and a communication channel.  The REC would include a security and disaster recovery solution in case the REC itself is affected.  A database storage system with back up and retrieval would be implemented as part of the REC.  

The project would also involve the establishment of IEMS infrastructure design for other municipal emergency centers to be created on a shared basis with local fire and rescue emergency centers.  The municipal emergency centers would act as points of communication and coordination, and would coordinate closely with the REC.  At present, most municipalities outside Sofia and Plovdiv have very little IEMS infrastructure.  Municipal emergency centers are critical to ensure that emergency management works regionally.  Because other regions must also acquire integrated emergency management capabilities, it is highly likely that they will follow the technological standards and solutions developed in Plovdiv.  The study and pilot together would establish a prototype design for IEMS transferable to other regional and municipal emergency centers, on a shared basis with existing local fire rescue emergency centers.   The IEMS can be defined in three major steps:

·	Definition of a functional model
·	Agreement on system architecture
·	Deployment of supporting infrastructure

A unified command and control center (for multiple first responders) would be at the center stage of the actual deployment of the IEMS.  This would incorporate the operations protocols, provisions for data collection, and exchange and voice communications.  There would be both primary and back-up control centers linked to satellite sites in the districts.
