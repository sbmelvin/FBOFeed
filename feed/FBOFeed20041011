<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The University of Chicago, as the M&O contractor at the Argonne National Laboratory, seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information with respect to their ability to provide waste management and/or laboratory support services to tenants of the Argonne National Laboratory  East (ANL-E) site in DuPage County, Illinois. 
ANL-E conducts basic and technology-directed research on a 1,500-acre campus located about 25 miles southwest of Chicago, Illinois.  Major facilities at the site include the Advanced Photon Source; the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source; the Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System; and the Electron Microscopy Center.  Researchers from outside the laboratory use all of these facilities extensively.  ANL-E also has the full spectrum of administrative and technical support organizations, as well as DOEs Chicago Operations Office and the New Brunswick Laboratory, both of which use facilities operated and maintained by ANL-E.
ANL-E currently houses approximately 4,800 persons, including employees of DOE, contractors and other guests.  An additional 2,200 individuals visit the site each year to use the research facilities.  ANL-E includes 101 buildings with approximately 4.6 million total square feet of floor space, half of which is used by DOE Office of Science research programs.
PROCESS: In order to minimize costs, both to potentially interested parties and the University of Chicago, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for this action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  SHOULD INTEREST BE DETERMINED SUFFICIENT, A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE FORTHCOMING.  The Service Contract Act (SCA) will apply to any request for proposals issued. This requirement is unrestricted.  Small Business interests should note the FAR Part 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
Codes and Size Standards (SS) for the waste management and laboratory support services identified in this announcement.  Some, all, or any combination of the following may apply:  NAICS/SS:  5621/$10.5M, 5622/$10.5M, 5629/$12.0M.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this RFI is to determine whether there is interest on the part of potential suppliers in providing waste management and laboratory support services to ANL-E.

PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting Contractor/Vendor Log In under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGOs, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this Levy provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the Packing and Marking Instructions of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
The following is information will be provided upon award to assist with the completion of the cargo plaque

Primary Contract Number #:  	 W914NS-05-X-XXXX

Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.


It is the contractors responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination. Delays resulting from failure to follow the above steps may be assigned as the contractors responsibility.
