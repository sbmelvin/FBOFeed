<DESC>This Request for Proposal (RFP) outlines the functional and performance requirements for TCP/IP-based video surveillance systems to be installed in a number of United States Postal Service facilities nation-wide. These systems will be managed by the Joint Criminal Investigative System Program Group (CISP) comprised of representatives of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the Office of Inspector General, United States Postal Service (OIG). 
This system includes hardware and software to allow the capture of video images from both analog cameras (through IP encoders) and IP cameras of varying resolutions. Also included are provisions to store the images on open architecture PC-based servers local to each facility, monitor images locally, and inte-gration to allow remote access, monitoring, and downloading of secure, authenticated video images. There are also provisions to integrate the video surveillance (CCTV) systems to other electronic security systems in use at these facilities.
The selected Vendor will be responsible for the procurement, installation, commissioning, training, and warranty coverage of the various system components provided as part of their agreement. They will also be responsible for the sustained performance of the entire system which will include certain components and subsystems sourced and provided by the USPS via their Acquisition of Desktop Extended Processing Technology (ADEPT) program. Components which will be provided by the USPS and specifically excluded from this agreement include workstations, servers, network switches, and desktop monitors.
Although certain equipment will be furnished by the USPS, each installation will be a turn-key system and bidding will be limited to Vendors that can perform all of the work in this RFP, either independently or through subcontracted services. While it is the intention of the USPS to purchase systems as specified in this document, there is no obligation on the part of the USPS to do so. The systems purchased may differ substantially from what is specified in this document, and the USPS reserves the right to cancel or amend this project without prejudice, incurring no costs for the time and expense provided by prospective Ven-dors in their bid preparation.

<DESC>The Statement of Work is as follows: Contractor qualification:  All title evidence must be obtained from qualified attorneys, abstracters, title companies, or federal employees familiar with the preparation of such evidence in the jurisdiction in which the lands are situated.  They should have no interest in the land to be acquired; and not be related to the vendors. Abstracters must be attorneys at law or professional or official abstracters qualified and authorized by law to prepare and certify to abstracts in the state where the land lies.  Title companies and their issuing agents must be qualified and authorized by law to furnish abstracts, certificates of title, or title insurance policies in the state where the land lies.   Statement of Work: Contractor shall perform a real property title search in Orange and Jefferson counties in Texas on properties that surround the Beaumont Reserve Fleet anchorage, located on the Neches River about 7 miles below Beaumont at the McFadden Bend Cut-off.  The title search shall include information regarding oil, gas and mineral interests applicable to the relevant properties. Deliverable: Certified documentation reflecting results of title search.  The title search shall conform to the standards set out in the U.S. Department of Justice "Title Standards 2001" (March 23, 2001) and specifically conform to Section 9 of Title Standards 2001 "Special Standards for Texas."  In the event of a conflict between the general terms of Title Standards 2001 and the specific terms of the "Special Standards for Texas," the latter shall control. In general, the character and scope of the evidence of title shall: "	consist of a reasonably diligent search of the records, considering the character and value of the property involved and the interests to be acquired;  "	disclose the name of each person in whom title to any interest is vested of record and all additional persons or entities who might have, or who claim to have an interest in the property; and  "	contain a sufficient summary of the material facts for the purpose of determining the validity of title when exceptions or objections to the title are noted.       Acceptable forms of title evidence include any of the following types of evidence prepared in accordance with the requirements of these standards, by approved abstracters, attorneys or title companies3: 1.	abstracts of title;  2.	Certificates of Title and  3.	title insurance commitments (binders, preliminary reports on title, etc.) which anticipate the issuance of a title insurance policy. Also acceptable are:  4.	Owners' duplicate certificates of title issued pursuant to satisfactory state systems of title registration similar to the Torrens system.  5.	Copies of public title records duly authenticated by their official custodian or certified by an approved abstracter, attorney or title company.       Evidence of title acceptable to prudent attorneys and title examiners in the locality in which the land is situated will ordinarily be acceptable.      An opinion of title prepared by a private attorney could be deemed to be sufficient evidence of title if, in the opinion of the reviewing federal agency attorney, it provides full disclosure of all matters affecting the title along with the attorney's comments and recommendations relating thereto.  If such a private attorney's opinion is deemed to be acceptable, then the federal agency attorney would issue his/her own opinion based on the information contained in the private opinion.      Ordinarily, one abstract, certificate, etc. will be obtained for all interests in each contiguous area of land in the same ownership.  Lands will be deemed to be contiguous although portions thereof are separated by roads, railroads or other rights of way, streams, etc.

<DESC>The JFDIO is a system that allows for input and output of flight data.  As flight plans are received by Air Traffic Controllers from the Japanese Airspace System, the plans will be converted by the Automated Protocol Exchanger (APEX) into the format used by the United States.  The flight plans will then be routed to the JFDIO whose function is to print these plans on a specialized flight strip printer.  In addition to this output of flight plans via the printer, controllers will also be able to create local flight plans, make changes to existing flight plans, and create what are referred to as stereo flight plans, or "canned" flight plans.  The JFDIO System is comprised of the software necessary to process flight data, a personal computer with monitor, peripheral input devices, and printer. There is incidental Technical Support and Travel to be included in this procurement.  This is a sole source procurement by the Air Force ESC/853d ELSG with JVN Company of Absecon NJ!  , only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii) (A), wherein substantial as authorized by duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center intends to award a sole-source contract extension to CNI Aviation LLC (CNI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source under Contract NNK06OU36C.	NASA KSC intends to extend the existing contract for a period of one (1) month, from March 01, 2008 through March 31, 2008, to allow the orderly award and transition of the follow-on contract, the Kennedy Institutional Support Services (KISS) acquisition. The current contractor provides administrative support services in functional areas of NASA?s Kennedy Space Center, FL.  These administrative support services include administrative assistance/secretarial activity, personnel program activity, employee development and training, employee benefits and personnel action processing and records management support.  The support services are essential to support the administrative activities at KSC.  CNI has the personnel and management structure in place to continue to provide these services without any interruption for the brief extension period.  Because of the time involved in procuring and phasing-in services from another contractor and because of the short-term nature of the contract extension, CNI is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NASA's needs without a disruption of services. This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a request for proposals.  There is no solicitation document available.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on February 19, 2008.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The products are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), Threat and Consequence Assessment Division (TCAD) has a requirement to enhance the automated syndromic surveillance software called Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) through the development of a water module. The prototype model shall incorporate community health data with water sector parameters to detect and communicate a drinking water contamination. This project aims to incorporate water sector data with public health data. The specificity of integrating these disparate data streams will provide earlier detection of a drinking water contamination incident. Geographic information regarding water utility pressure zones shall be used to cluster the health data. Software shall be developed that fuses available bio-surveillance data with water quality event detection algorithms using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The analysis performed in this project would calculate the probability of a water contamination event given changes in water quality measurements and/or health indicator data.  Both visual and analytical tools specific to water sector data shall be developed. The tasks to be performed under the Performance Work Statement include: (1) Obtain Data Sharing Agreements; (2) Data Collection and Analysis; (3) Prototype Development for the RODS System Water Module; (4) Training and Beta Testing and ; (5) Develop, Apply and Summarize Evaluation Methods.  This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures.  EPA anticipates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The RFP PR-CI-08-10286 shall be solicited under full and open competition with the NAICS code designation for the acquisition being 541614.  The solicitation is expected to be issued in March 2008 on EPA's website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The United States Government intends to award a lease, using other than full and open competition to NOP 8484 Georgia Avenue, LLC for expansion space for an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) located at 8484 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland.

This lease will be for 6,706 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a five-year two-month firm term.  Those occupying the space will have access to a generator and secure communication areas.  The total space occupied by the agency will be approximately 16,000 rentable square feet.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) intends to negotiate an extension under contract N00033-02-C-3201 on a sole source basis with Maersk Lines Limited. The sole source extension is needed for the operation and maintenance of eight (8) Watson class Large, Medium-Speed Roll-On/Roll-Off (LMSR) vessels. It is anticipated that this extension will be needed for a nine month period.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is issuing a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the Conference Exhibit Support Services. The purpose of this DRFP is to solicit industry comments and questions on the proposed requirement prior to issuing the final RFP.  Questions/comments are strongly encouraged from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRFP, including requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach.  Potential offerors are requested to identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements.  The MDA will accept questions/comments on the DRFP up to and including the day of January 28, 2008.  All contractual and/or technical questions shall be submitted in writing (e-mail) to Elizabeth Hoshaw at Elizabeth.Hoshaw@mda.mil.  Telephone questions are not acceptable.  Industry input to the DRFP will be considered in formulating the final RFP.  The Government is not requesting proposals in response to this DRFP, does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the DRFP, or to pay for any information received regarding the DRFP.  The anticipated release date for the final RFP is on or about February 19, 2008 with an anticipated offer closing date of on or about March 19, 2008.  The firm date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the final RFP. 

This requirement is restricted as a Total Small Business Set Aside and will be procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) category for this requirement is 541613, Marketing Consulting Services, with a size standard of $6.5 million.  All responsible sources qualifying as small businesses under the above mentioned NAICS Code may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

This requirement is for domestic and international venues beginning in 2008 with a potential period of performance through 2012 for the Public Affairs (PA) Directorate.  The support consists of producing and maintaining exhibits and providing on-site public relations support to help MDA illustrate and communicate the major milestones and strategic objectives of the Ballistic Missile Defense System and its capabilities. Exhibit support activities include, but are not limited to, exhibit design, graphic design, strategic communications, photo gathering, exhibit fabrication, exhibit repairs, event analysis and selection, procuring exhibit space, transporting exhibit to events (both CONUS and OCONUS), coordinating all customs requirements, installing complete exhibit at events, developing audio and video presentations, storing exhibits both in CONUS and abroad in an insured facility and developing print handouts. 

The current exhibit inventory allows for approximately 12 different layouts and configurations ranging in size from 100 sq ft to 600 sq ft. (A full listing of the Government Furnished Equipment will be provided with the Request for Proposal.)  It incorporates an advanced sound system, video projection, plasma and LCD monitors, and theatrical lighting. The Contractor will be required to maintain and repair this inventory to include mishaps, breaks, and malfunctions and resolve unforeseen circumstances that arise in the field or during transport, and is expected to have an alternate plan of action for emergency situations. In addition, exhibit support shall include on-site management and public relations. The exhibit shall be manned at all hours during an event by person(s) who are knowledgeable concerning MDA programs, recent achievements and future goals and has excellent communication skills in order to answer technical questions from a wide spectrum of audiences, i.e., students, engineers, US Flag Officers from all military branches, and international diplomats and military officers.  The exhibit also requires the availability of technical expertise capable of providing on-site trouble-shooting support to identify and repair operational problems that may arise with exhibit displays and equipment used at the exhibit event.

The current list of scheduled events for 2008 and beyond includes approximately 16 events (both domestic and international), but could increase by two to three additional events each year.

Minimal Qualifications:  

- Four year Bachelors Degree (Key Personnel).
- Knowledge and experience with  Missile Defense systems; 
- Recent and relevant experience within the last three (3) years in the following areas:
- Exhibit planning and public affairs/public relations;
- Developing exhibit strategies;
- On-site event support;
- International and domestic shipping techniques and options, electrical standards and customs requirements. 
- Experience managing and maintaining multiple exhibit configurations.
-SECRET clearance at contract award (interim clearances are not acceptable).

The anticipated contract type is Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Fixed Price, Level of Effort (LOE) with Cost Reimbursable CLINs for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) to include travel, shipping costs, drayage fees, etc.  The base contract period of performance will be eight months with four, twelve month options.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government anticipates using the following evaluation criteria for award:

1.	Technical
2.	Past Performance
3.	Management
4.	Cost/Price

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

The Government may use support contractor personnel to assist in the competitive process and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this requirement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information, and the identity of their companies will be disclosed in the final RFP.

The solicitation and all documents related to this procurement are available on Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeds), website http://www.fedteds.gov, using the solicitation number HQ0006-08-R-0001.

<SUBJECT>B -- Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program FY 2009, Broad Agency Announcement

<RESPDATE>031808
<ARCHDATE>04022008

<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as ?Challenge Proposals? proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that ?challenge? an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equipment, combined equipment, longer missions, better batteries). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level); surveillance, tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training). 4.) Other proposals that support our national strategy.  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under ?Reference Materials? on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2009 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2008. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil. Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 2000 hours EST, 18 February 2008. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21893 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.  Submissions must be received at the office and cited no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on 28 February 2008.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to Linda Nelson at linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.  

DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE INDUSTRY HELD ON 2/12/2008 MAY BE FOUND ON THE NAVAIR WEBSITE AT WWW.NAVAIR.NAVY.MIL UNDER THE SAME SOLICITATION NUMBER. THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE UNTIL 3/14/2008.

<DESC>**Notice was modified to reflect the correct Point of Contact (POC) information.  

This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) intends to negotiate an extension under contract N00033-02-C-3201 on a sole source basis with Maersk Lines Limited. The sole source extension is needed for the operation and maintenance of eight (8) Watson class Large, Medium-Speed Roll-On/Roll-Off (LMSR) vessels. It is anticipated that this extension will be needed for a nine month period. The nine month extension will consist of two option periods: Option period One from April 1, 2008-September 30, 2008 (approximately 6 months) and Option period Two from October 1, 2008-December 31, 2008 (approximately 3 months).

The current contract N00033-02-C-3201 expires on March 31, 2008, therefore a follow-on sole source extension is needed in order to bridge the gap between the existing contract and the commencement performance under the new contract for the re-procurement of the eight (8) LMSR vessels (Solicitation N00033-07-R-3200). 

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to negotiate with Maersk Lines Limited under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) and FAR 6.302-1, Unusual and compelling urgency). Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), the services are deemed to be available only from one source for a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.

<DESC>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine program operates approximately 200 specially equipped aircraft from 20 separate locations to provide homeland air sovereignty by interdicting persons and contraband attempting to enter the United States of America illegally.  The crewmembers of these aircraft require initial and optional recurrent and specialized environmental courses of instruction in surviving an aircraft accident and staying alive until rescue personnel can arrive.  

CBP has a requirement to procure the required classroom training and practical field training instruction for U.S. Government personnel in the concepts of survival techniques. The training shall consist of initial training and recurrent training and specialized environmental training.  Initial training is defined as a thorough, in-depth, detailed, course of instruction on survival techniques to CBP enforcement personnel who are receiving the course from CBP for the first time.  The course of instruction shall consist of classroom lecture and practical exercises in the pool and field training areas.  Recurrent PASS training is defined as an optional course of instruction designed as a review of the Initial PASS training course and may include specialized training for specific operating locations or aircraft types.  Specialized Environmental Training courses are designed to educate CBP A&M aircrew members on survival techniques related to geographically specific areas (i.e. winter, desert, tropical or open water).    

Some types of training anticipated are: aircraft cockpit fire and smoke management, emergency egress training and water survival, land survival, field emergency medical training, first aid and principles of terrorism.

All interested vendors shall use the Interested Vendors List Module.

Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a justification for other than full and open competition: The Office of Acquisition Management (LM/AQM), Department of State, is processing this acquisition at the request of the Systems, integrity Division. This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of SafeNet Luna products on a brand name only basis. 2.                        Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Interoperability of the components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Entrust nor Safenet cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the continued operation of the Departments PKI.4.      An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full  and open competition.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.  5.      A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or  the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or Safenet. If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Maintenance of these products is required to ensure that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet. Installation of a different hardware security module may have the following issues:       1.    Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other warranties associated with the equipment and software.       2.    Interoperability cannot be guaranteed.       3.    Support fro functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future medications cannot be guarantee to be supported.<BR><BR>6.      A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from  as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors. 7.      A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to  the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable. 8.      A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a  statement of the reasons market research was not conducted. Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed...PKI/BLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet.  Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution.  Should a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these products will be considered as potential sources.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Delta Information Systems, Inc., GDP Space Systems Division Horsham, Pennsylvania, for porting the existing Model 225WA and 225WB Polar frame Synchronizer (PFS) software from the currently implemented MS NT Operating System to the QNX Operating system. The final result of the "port" shall be a single release, hosted on QNX that will run on both the 225WA and the 225WB Frame Synchronizers. This requirement covers the porting of the drivers and application software originally developed by GDP Space Systems, the first article testing of both a 225WA and a 225WB at Delta Information Systems, Inc., in Horsham, PA and the final on-site testing at Wallops, Virginia, or Suitland, Maryland. 

The OS port effort shall utilize  most of existing hardware with the exception of the hard drives. The hard drives shall be replaced with new solid state flash drives that shall include the re-hosted application on the QNX Operating System. The existing hard drive shall remain for data recording and storage. The contractor shall provide additional tested flash drives that contain the re-hosted application on the QNX Operating System along with any required licenses to all PFS 225WA and 225WB at NOAA sites.  

The current 225WA and WB application shall be re-hosted on the QNX Operating System. All functions currently performed by the existing frame synchronizers shall be supported by the new application. No interfaces shall be added or removed and interface functionality shall be identical to the existing NT Version. The contractor shall provide one release that works on both the MD225WA and the MD225WB. The PFS 225WA and 225WB shall have the same status message format and length.  For ease of transition into operation, the 225WA and 225WB shall be configurable to provide both current status messages and new status messages.  The 225WA and 225WB will be switched to the new status message format when operations upon completion of the upgrades.  No new functionality shall be proposed for either the MD225WA or MD225WB. 

The difference in the Model 225W and the Model 225WB Frame Synchronizer is that the Model 225WB can be used as a stand-alone Weather Format Synchronizer (WFS). The primary function of both models is ingesting and synchronizing to data from the TIROS-N Weather Satellites.  The units synchronize to the data streams and detect a predefined valid frame synchronizer pattern in the presence of bit-errors based on a flexible programmable synchronization strategy.  Telemetry data is then decommutated and extracted from the data stream and transmitted along with measured data quality information to other system equipment through the Ethernet LAN and analog interfaces.  The unit is capable of sending and receiving the frame synchronized data via the respective input and output Ethernet ports.  The Ethernet input/output message format is defined and agreed to by NOAA.  The unit is housed in a rack mountable chassis and can be controlled locally from the front panel keyboard and menu driven display, or remotely from the host computer over the Command/Quality LAN Unicast channel. The unit also includes a built in simulator function that simulates all of the weather input formats supported by the unit.  This function accommodates both loopback test and simulator output test and acts as a telemetry data recorder of the input signal.  The unit can perform a verification of the simulator data as a self-test feature.

Both GDP Frame Synchronizers support the data formats of both the ATN and the KLM spacecraft.  These formats include HRPT (High Resolution Picture Transmission), LAC (Local Area Coverage), GAC (Global Area Coverage), AIP (AMSU Information Processor), SAIP (Stored AIP), TIP (TIROS Information Processor), TIP Boost  (TIROS Information Processor-Boost), and STIP (Stored TIP) data formats.  Aboard the spacecraft the TIP, HRPT, and/or the AIP data is transmitted in real-time, while the LAC, GAC, SAIP, and/or STIP data are played back from digital tape recorders in reverse direction.  The models will accept all formats and synchronize to them in both the forward and the reverse direction and perform polarity resolution (APC -Automatic Polarity Control) to correct for inverted data.  Specific synchronization strategies can be remotely programmed into the box.  The data will then be individually processed depending on the format.  Each of these supported formats are processed by the format synchronizer and routed to the specified output ports.

No solicitation will be released for this requirement. If an interested offeror believes it can perform this upgrade based on Government requirements, it shall respond within the specified date, to the agency contact point, describing how it can satisfy the Government?s needs without causing unacceptable delays, duplicating costs, or failure to meet technical objectives. Interested sources shall submit a written narrative of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature, demonstrating the ability to provide the required services in sufficient detail to permit an agency analysis to determine a bona-fide capability to meet the Government's requirements, within 45 days of the publication of this notice or by c.o.b. March 31, 2008.  Responses without the required documentation shall be considered non-responsive.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this notice or the Government?s use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. Responses must be submitted in writing (three copies) and must include all information cited herein. Submission shall be mailed to: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NESDIS Acquisition Management Division, SSMC3- Room 10100/OFA64, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attention: E. L. Jones. Telephonic responses shall not be accepted.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOB). Only small businesses are to submit capability packages.  Interested small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business concern in NAICS code 518210 with a size standard of $23 million, are encouraged to submit their capability packages outlining their experience meeting the items in Table 1 Check List .

  This Sources Sought Synopsis is for information and planning purposes to determine if the Billing and Account Receivable services can be procured as a small business set-aside. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A Contract will not be awarded as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  Since this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. The Government intends to issue a combined synopsis/solicitation under FAR 12.603 at a later date.

If at least two responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages, then the requirement will be solicited as a set-aside for small business concerns.  If the Government determines that there are not two small businesses that are capable of performing this requirement based upon evaluation of the capability packages submitted, this requirement will be solicited under full and open procedures.

The General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), the Financial Management System Division (BD) intends to procure a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for Billing and Accounts Receivable solution (BAAR), Managed Hosting Services and Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) support. The proposed period of performance for this acquisition will be for a base period of four (4) years with three two (2) year option periods.
The BAAR solution shall include the functionality of Unfilled Customer Orders, Unbilled Receivables Management, Billing, Billed Receivable Management and Collections, Delinquency Management and Claims.  The proposed solution must support GSA and the agencies GSA is providing accounting services for as a Financial Management Line of Business (FMLOB). 
GSA has implemented Momentum Financials as their financial system of record, which includes a General Ledgar (GL), Accounts Payable, Budget, Automated Disbursements, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) Connector, and other financial components.  The BAAR system proposed should integrate into the GL established by Momentum Financials and not have a separate GL structure.  There shall be only one GL.  
The BAAR system shall include inbound and outbound interfaces, many of which may utilize Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and open source standards.  It shall take into account the work already completed or ongoing efforts in the areas of GSAs Financial Management Enterprise Architecture (FMEA).  

Background
GSA is the Federal Government agency whose two major services, Public Building Service (PBS) and Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), operate the following 7 major business lines:
(1)Global Supply and Services
(2)Personal Property
(3)Travel
(4)Motor Vehicle and Card Services
(5)Integrated Technology Services
(6)Assisted Acquisition Services, and
(7)Real Property Services

The Office of Governmentwide Policy and the Office of Citizen Services and Communications also have requirement for collections.  Through these programs GSA has over 70 sources of income. GSAs major customers are Federal agencies across the Military and Civilian sectors.  In many business lines GSA acts as a broker, placing orders for products and services; sometimes managing that work on behalf of the Federal agency, and then billing the Federal agencies.  Bill calculations and bill dates vary based on business line.  The estimated volume of billing is approximately $16.2 billion in bills, $18.5 billion in collections and about 2.4 million records each year.  The types of billing include:  InterGovernmental Payment and Collection System (Treasury) (IPAC), non-IPAC, Simplified InterGovernmental Billing and Collection System (military only) (SIBAC) for GSA, National Weather Service (NWS) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Interfund/Intrafund and credit cards.  The current system generates 27 different types of bills to support the business lines and billing types.

GSA legacy system for BAAR is a 30 + year old proprietary main frame legacy system.  It is no longer feasible or cost effective to maintain this system as it cannot be easily upgraded to implement new Government rules and guidelines, cannot support new technologies which could reduce/eliminate manual processes, or meet increasing security requirements.  The system includes many redundant processes and does not support GSA FMEA.  

Response to this Notice
Interested small businesses are required to provide an electronic copy in Microsoft Office Suite of their response to the Contracting Officer by 3:00 PM on the due date. Responses must address relevant experience and past performance limited to Federal engagements, and existing offerings.  Responses must also indicate business capability to perform the proposed services identified above.  In addition, the small business shall complete the provided Check List and provide the supporting information that validates a positive (YES) response. A (YES) response requires all necessary supporting information validating the response, references of the Federal Government Clients where the solution was implemented, and the contact information of the clients who can provide verification.  Capability Statements are to be limited to 20 pages (minimum font size 12).  You are not to submit brochures and marketing materials, and any such material will be discarded.

In summary, The Offeror is required to submit a response that includes the following (subject to the page limit):
(1)Relevant Experience Summary
(2)Past Performance Summary including the references and contact information
(3)A list of Existing Offerings
(4)Capability Statement
(5)Check List  
(6)Supporting Information for all YES Responses on the Check List

Summary
Small Business Concerns are invited to identify their interest, technical capability, and respond to this Source Sought Notice within 13 calendar days, by 3:00 PM EST, February 27, 2008.

Send written responses to Ms. Carolyn Turner, Contracting Officer, at the Email address listed below.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.

Request for Information 

(RFI)

for

ARMY PROCESSING CENTERS

Closing Date: 29 February 2008.

The Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Director for the Chief Technical Offices (CTO) in partnership with the Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G6 is conducting market research to identify the strategies and the use of currently available products, technologies and services capable of providing assured IT capabilities (information delivery, information protection, and systems and network availability) across its global user base to support the requirements as stated in the below ?Requirements Statement? paragraph.  These services are currently being considered as part of the Army's Processing Center and server consolidation initiatives.

Responses should address strategies that the Army should consider implementing in order to meet the users? critical mission and internal business requirements and maintain security at reasonable life cycle costs.  The Army IT performance and sensitivity requirements can be compared to commercial finance, commerce and health care systems.

Interested sources are requested to provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies.  The Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their white papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue.

Requirement Statement:

The Army is required to provide IT capabilities to its user base of 1,500,000 distributed across 6 operating regions globally and four security domains.  Each region is not equal to the others based on assigned mission and could have as few as 50,000 users and up to 1,200,000 users.  Each region has many campuses with each campus having a user base of 50 to 40,000.  The population of each campus is composed of users that either always operate in their home campus; road warriors that could operate at any of the global campuses; and expeditionary users that could roam from campus to campus or establish a new austere campus as related to IT or communications infrastructure.
    Each user requires the capability for electronic messaging, collaboration, and storage.  The user base will also need to be able to access computer applications that are:
- Unique to their location or mission 
- Common across a campus, region or community of interest
- Enterprise level or common to the greater user population
   Some of the user base will be required to sign and/or encrypt their messaging using PKI/PKE, and also use mobile wireless devices
-  User devices need to be standard, managed and protected while minimizing user training or experience required to accomplish this effort.  The device configurations must meet and maintain Army, DoD and Federal policies and regulations to protect the data and network they traverse while still maintaining their ability to accomplish their user-specific mission.  The remote applications that the users access are required  be managed and protected to ensure availability and prevent compromise.


RFI Purpose and Limitations:

The Government?s intention is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Government?s interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  Please limit your formal white paper submission to no more than 20 pages to include cover letter and white paper.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Intermodal Security Training Exercise Program (I-STEP) under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Transportation Security Network Management (TSNM).  

BACKGROUND

The mission of the TSNM administration is to protect the Nations transportation systems and its users by collaborating with transportation sectors to identify and mitigate transportation security risks. The mission includes mitigating the risk of all terrorist disruption to transportation systems, including waterway, rail, highways, mass transit and pipelines. The TSNM administration is responsible for the security of passengers, cargo and infrastructure.

The desired outcome of the I-STEP is for the transportation security industry to increase their level of preparedness to prevent, respond to and recover from a terrorist or transportation security incident. A transportation security incident (TSI) can result in loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, and/or economic disruption in a particular area. This can be accomplished by conducting exercises, evaluating and correcting contingency plans, and having transportation security personnel interact with federal, state, and local agencies to learn about one anothers organizations, assets, plans and abilities in order to prevent, respond and recover from a terrorist or security incident.  

Exercises should identify areas for improvements, disconnects and gaps in the security plans and evaluating contingency plans, so they can be used to formulate corrective actions and foster interagency communication. Information about the efforts used to formulate corrective action and to foster interagency communication should be collected and analyzed so that program managers can gain insight to best practices, shortcomings, and improvement opportunities.  Technology should be employed to enhance exercise impact and realism, facilitate record keeping and data/trends analysis, increase the availability of information, and boost stakeholder communication and collaboration.

I-STEPs primary objective is to design, develop, implement, and evaluate security training exercises for use by the intermodal transportation system operators, e.g. Freight Rail, Mass Transit, and Highway modes and area maritime transportation security community, to continuously improve security plans and operations readiness to prevent, respond to, and recover from a TSI. 


OBJECTIVES

The overall objective of this Sources Sought Notice is to improve the understanding of industry capabilities and identify qualified sources to provide services in support of the I-STEP.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans to negotiate on a competitive basis to award an Echocardiography Reading Center (Echo RC) contract as part of the renewal of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The CARDIA renewal involves a Year 25 clinical examination (Year 25 Exam) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed June 2010 through May 2011; and continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort through September 30, 2013. The Echo RCs effort is expected to begin on March 1, 2009 and to end September 30, 2013. The CARDIA Echo RC contractor will be responsible for the various aspects related to the echocardiographic measurements to be collected and assessed in the Year 25 Exam.
	
The CARDIA Study started as a study of the distribution and evolution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease during young adulthood in black and white men and women. The Study began recruitment in 1985 and has completed 7 examinations over 20 years in a cohort of 5,115 men and women aged 18-30 years in four communities. The original cohort had approximately equal representation by blacks and whites, men and women, those aged 18-24 and 25-30 years, and those with no more than and more than a high school education. The baseline examination (Year 0) was conducted over a 14-month period during 1985-86. The examination consisted of questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and psychological factors; an exercise treadmill test; resting electrocardiography; a diet history assessment; anthropometry; pulmonary function testing; resting blood pressure; and fasting blood measurements. Six additional examinations have been completed every 2-5 years, including most recently a Year 20 examination completed in 2006. Retention of the surviving cohort was 90, 86, 81, 79, 74, and 72 percent at each of the respective follow-up examinations. Repeat measurements on several traditional risk factors have used the same methods at each examination to assess age and secular trends in these factors during young adulthood. In selected years, additional measurements have been made, including echocardiography at Year 5 (in nearly the full cohort) and Year 10 (in a subset of the cohort).  
	
At the Year 25 Exam (to be conducted from June 2010 through May 2011), participants will be 43-55 years old, when risk factors and subclinical abnormalities become more prevalent and clinical events begin to emerge. CARDIA offers the opportunity to address aspects of the development and progression of subclinical vascular, ventricular, and pulmonary function abnormalities that cannot be addressed in older cohorts. The renewal of the CARDIA study will address five objectives: 1) Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life; 2) Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation; 3) Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age; 4)Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development; 5) Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas.
	
The technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the CARDIA Echo RC include the following:

1.	Develop the protocol for the acquisition, reading, and information abstraction of the echocardiograms to be performed as part of the CARDIA Year 25 Exam. As much as feasible, the protocol shall aim to be comparable to the echocardiographic examination performed during the Year 5 Exam.

2.	Determine comparability of the proposed echocardiographic protocol for the Year 25 Exam to that for the Year 5 Exam by performing repeat measures of a subset of videotaped echocardiograms and 10% blind duplicated measures of studies from the Year 5 Exam.

3.	Convert the videotaped echocardiograms from the CARDIA Year 5 and Year 10 Exams into digital electronic files and copied onto disks for secure archival storage.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers Honolulu District is conducting a market survey on the capability and interest of firms to perform a civil works flood control construction project at Iao Stream, Island of Maui, State of Hawaii using the roller compact ed concrete method.  Additional information regarding the Iao Stream Flood Control project is as follows: The Iao Stream Flood Control Project is located in the town of Wailuku on the Island of Maui, State of Hawaii.  The project was constructed in October  1981 to protect the town of Wailuku from destructive floods by channelizing the high velocity floodwaters into the Pacific Ocean.  The project has prevented an estimated $24.2 million in damages, to date.  The project was designed for a standard project f lood protection with a peak design discharge of 27,500 cfs.  The completed project consists of a debris basin located 2.5 miles upstream from the stream mouth, channel improvements extending 3,500 feet downstream from the debris basin, levees along the rig ht bank and floodplain management along the left bank for the next 6,950 feet of natural stream, and stream realignment with channel improvements for a reach of 1,730 feet which extends the downstream limit of the project located near the shoreline.  Storm s occurring in March 1990 which approximated the 10-year flood event (6,000 cfs), caused extensive erosion to the levee toe.  Although no major storm events have occurred since the 1990s, the existing structures are being further damaged by continued erosi on.  Under existing damaged conditions, the occurrence of the design discharge will result in failure of the levee system and extensive flooding.  To correct this problem and to eliminate levee failure, protective works are required to prevent damages to a djacent floodplain property and to preserve the integrity of the existing structures.  The stream channel will be lined and the levees will be raised to sustain the high flows, while maintaining a natural stream appearance.  The estimated project construct ion cost is $30 million.  Any interested firms with experience using the roller compacted concrete method are requested to submit information about their firm and experiences, particularly experience similar to the Iao Stream Flood Control Project by March  5, 2008 to Kent Tamai, US Army Engineer District, Honolulu, Attn:  Contracting Division, Bldg 230, Ft Shafter, Hawaii  96858-5440 or to kent.a.tamai@usace.army.mil.

<LOCATION>Bureau of Reclamation

<OFFADD>Bureau of Reclamation - Ephrata Field Office P.O. Box 815 Ephrata  wa 98823
<SUBJECT>R--Sole Source Intent
<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Ephrata Field Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory and assistance services with Ms. Donna Postma. Ms. Postma will assist Reclamation with her knowledge and expertise and as a witness during litigation by submitting court and other documents and affidavits in support of Reclamation's programs including water rights claims and proof of appropriations, in the matter of CV. No. 06-204-RHW brought by Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District, et al., (BSID). Ms. Postma will work with experts from the Washington State Department of Ecology to develop a management program for the use of ground water in the 508-14 management area. Proposed tasks include: Research and prepare documents for the Federal Government's case in the BSID lawsuit, provide testimony and declarations for use by the Federal Government in the BSID lawsuit. Working with the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE), and develop a joint management program for the 508-14 waste, seepage and return flow management area. This work will be performed by the contractor using unique knowledge gained over 3 previous lawsuits filed by the BSID. The contractor also has worked with the programs directly associated with the management of the Quincy Groundwater Management program, including the groundwater licenses and yearly billing of charges. This work will consist of functioning as a witness for Reclamation during the litigation of the BSID lawsuit.  The contractor will work with legal counsel for the Government to develop, prepare and deliver testimony in all forms when required by the Government. The contractor will also assist legal counsel in development and preparation of testimony for other witnesses within the Government's case.  The proposed contractor will be working with personnel from DOE in the development of a joint management program for utilization of the waste, seepage and return flows moving through the 508-14 area. Water in the 508-14 area has been imported by Reclamation during irrigation of the Columbia Basin Project since 1952. Reclamation made claim to the water and the DOE agreed that the water was Reclamation water and should be subject to licensing by Reclamation. The contractor has worked directly with a similar program called the Quincy Groundwater Program for many years as the groundwater specialist and Manager of the Environmental and Contracts workgroup at the EFO.  The timeframe for performing this task will be dictated by the requirements of the court. It is anticipated that the lawsuit will be litigated by the end of fiscal year 2009 but may extend beyond at the behest of the court.  Ms. Postma worked for Reclamation as a Manager of the Environment, Contracts and Water Rights Division at the Columbia Basin Project/Ephrata Field Office for the past 18 years.  Prior to her work for Reclamation, Ms. Postma worked as a Reclamation Reform Act Specialist for the Quincy Columbia Basin Irrigation District.  During her career with Reclamation, Ms. Postma acquired unique knowledge and skills in water rights, repayment contracting and Reclamation law.  Reclamation requires the services of a contractor who has in-depth knowledge of Reclamation's water rights, legislative authorizations, historical precedents and regulations, repayment and water service contracts, court decisions, unique State statutes, Federal contracts and Acts of Congress affecting the water rights in the Columbia Basin Project and throughout north-central Washington, Idaho and Montana.  Reclamation also requires specific knowledge of the inter-relationship between State and Federal water law as it pertains to ground and surface water rights, the contractual relationships and roles of Reclamation and its contracting water entities and individuals.  Because of Reclamation's trust responsibility to Native Americans, contractual obligations to other water users throughout the Project and Field Office area and the complexity of the water rights and contracting processes, it is not possible to find other contractors capable of providing for our immediate needs.  Further, during Ms. Postma's long service to the Columbia Basin Project, she has gained a unique knowledge of Project history, documents and reports and has become extremely familiar with the relationship between State and federal water law, Reclamation's relationship with its contracting irrigation districts, and the existence and location of highly relevant materials which often play a vital role in protecting United States' interests.  Therefore, it is to the Government's interest to acquire the services of Ms. Postma. Ms Postma's unique knowledge of Federal regulations, Washington State law and the requirements of a ground water licensing program make her the only available person to work on Task 3 of this contract. Her years of unique experience associated with the prior BSID lawsuits and her knowledge of what have been done previously again make her the only available person to supply testimony on the operations of the Quincy Groundwater program for the past 18 years. While others have knowledge of aspects of the lawsuit, Ms Postma has knowledge of aspects that no one else has worked with.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Please send any responses to Lynn Wahl, Purchasing Agent, Bureau of Reclamation P.O. Box 815 Ephrata, WA 98823

<SUBJECT>TOCNET HEADSET INDUSTRY DAY
<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of Tactical Operations Center Intercommunication System (TOCNET) headsets, and cables in support of the USMC MRAP Program. An Industry Day will be held on Tuesday 26 February 2008, at the University of South Carolina Small Business Development Center, 5900 Core Drive, Suite 500, North Charleston, SC 29406, from 08:30 am to 12:00 pm.

Each contractor must submit a list of attendees electronically to the Contract Negotiator at joann.lawless@navy.mil NLT COB 22 February 2008.  You must have your name submitted in order to gain access. The following headset problem has been identified; therefore to make the Industry Day as productive as possible, offerors are asked to bring their headset to plug-in into a TOCNET system. Problem: When we plugged the current headset into the TOCNET CAU, the Active Noise Reduction and Push-to-talk (PTT) feature errors.  cancellation of interference. Current solution for current headset: A special cable was designed by the current headset manufacturer to permit The CAU Interface cable, which interfaces with the TOCNET system, has a computer chip internally that controls the signal flow of the noise reduction and the Push-to-Talk (PTT) to the device being used commonly called Active Noise Reduction (ANR).  ANR in the current headset is achieved through the use of this computer chip, which analyzes the waveform of the background aural or nonaural noise, then generates a polarized reversed waveform to cancel out interference. This waveform has identical or directly proportional amplitude to the waveform of the original noise, but its polarity is reversed, thus creating the destructive interference that reduces the amplitude of the perceived noise. The Government anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Firm-Fixed Price, commercial type contract under FAR Part 12 for the procurement of headsets and cables.  The Government reserves the right to solicit as a set-aside for one of the preference programs or on a unrestricted basis. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments.  No paper distribution of these documents will be provided. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334290 and the size standard is 750 employees. Interested parties may submit comments/questions in writing to the contract specialist, Jo Ann Lawless, Code 2.2.3JL, SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston, at e-mail address joann.lawless@navy.mil.

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).  Specific Make and Model request for Mitsui Data Storage Media.  The Configuration Management Division, SMC Montgomery is responsible for the creation, mass reproduction and distribution of software releases for numerous critical defense systems.   This is accomplished by the use of automated high-volume robotic duplication equipment supporting both inkjet and thermal printers. These releases are produced on MicroTech Duplicators running continuously 24/7.  MicroTech Duplicators require the use of these Mitsui products because of thickness and composition.  The majority of CD-Rs and DVD-Rs are produce for desk top computers and aren?t suitable for mass production processes.  Duplicators require high quality input media in order to efficiently produce the required volume and quality of output media necessary to support a DoD wide customer base without jamming, distorting or producing otherwise unusable media. Experience has shown that only these Mitsui products work in this process.  A firm fixed price award is anticipated and the estimated cost is [REDACTED].

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.  

a) MAM-A (Mitsui) Part# 00041018, 700MB (80 Min) Silver CD-R with Color Termal Clearcoat, Media Dye Phthalocyanine, 52X
b) MAM-A (Mitsui) Part# 000163119, DVD-Recordable Discs (DVD-R), 4.7V2, 16X, MAM HUB (S)/BHV, Thermal Silver.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.  The Mitsui CD-Rs and DVD-Rs are the only reliable media for use in mass volume duplicators.  These products are recommended by the duplicator?s manufacturer and past experience with other media resulted in malfunctions, system shut downs and a wasted dollars.  Most CDs and DVDs are designed for desk top use not mass production.  The Mitsui?s thickness and composition produces the durability needed for success software production.

<DESC>**Due date for proposals remains: 20 Feb 2008, 11:00 AM Local Alaska Time**

The following are contractor questions and Coast Guard provided responses:

Question 1) If we manufacture the shafts using ABS grade 2 forgings (ASTM-A-688) can we substitute this same material for the propeller nut and keys? Would 1045 material be acceptable?

Answer 1) If the shaft is manufactured of ABS grade 2 forgings (ASTM-A-688) then the same material shall be used for the propeller nut and keys.  ASTM 1045 is not acceptable.

Question 2) The key and keyway dimensions are not given on the drawing. 

Answer 2) Review of 167WAT-4301-10 shows detail 9-A and Section 8-C provides questioned dimensions.  This should be sufficient to prepare an accurate bid.  Upon award Coast Guard will work in cooperation with the Contractor to establish any additional details (not clear or deficient on drawing) required to complete fabrication.

Question 3) The propeller shaft in the original drawing (167WAT-4301-1) is a 1 piece shaft with a forged flange. Was this detail changed due to availability of material? 

Answer 3) Good observation.  The flange was removed in 1999, due to pitting/damage.  The adjoining stern tube shaft (that will remain in place) has been modified to use the existing straight coupling.  Coast Guard has intentionally decided to continue with a flangeless propeller shaft (as depicted in (167WAT-4301-10).

All other requirements remain unchanged.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625454 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Test Procedure:     1) Infrared and gas chromatographic analysis shall be used to identify fruit fly attractants.     2) Samples shall be well mixed.     Samples which lack in homogeneity shall be rejected.   Cuelure samples shall be placed in thin (short path) optical cell, or equivalent.     A complete curve of optical absorbency shall be performed, as in the attached standard curve.     The infrared spectrum of the sample shall be in close agreement with attached Cuelure spectrum.     3) For quantitative infrared analysis, the standard curve shall be prepared from 10-20 mgs of standard fruit fly attractant per ml of carbon disulfide.     The standard curve shall be compared to the sample.     The APHIS Standard is maintained at NMRAL.     After appropriate mathematical conversions off the difference in concentration, the heights of at least three major peaks shall be compared.     If the difference between the heights of the three peaks on the standard curve, compared to the sample curve, is greater than five percent, the lot represented by the sample shall be rejected.     4) Gas chromatographic analysis shall be performed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector as follow: A) Column: DB-1,30 meter Megabore r, 0.53 mm inside diameter, or equivalent.     B) Carrier gas: Helium at approximately 12ml/minute.     C) Temperature: Column 130 degree centigrade holds 12 minute, then program at 30 degree centigrade/minute to 250 degree centigrade hold one minute.     Injection port 250 degrees centigrade.     Detector block 275 degree centigrade.    D) Sample: Inject 1.0 ul of 1.0 percent solution of Cuelure in carbon disulfide or hexane.     E) Retention time: 9.1 minutes (varies with temperature, flow rate, etc.).     F) Purity: Shall be based on the area under curve exclusive of solvent peak.
SAMPLING OF DELIVERED PRODUCT:     Upon the delivery of the final product the Government shall take random samples from each lot for testing in the manner described in the test procedures.

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).  Specific Make and Model request for Mitsui Data Storage Media.  The Configuration Management Division, SMC Montgomery is responsible for the creation, mass reproduction and distribution of software releases for numerous critical defense systems.   This is accomplished by the use of automated high-volume robotic duplication equipment supporting both inkjet and thermal printers. These releases are produced on MicroTech Duplicators running continuously 24/7.  MicroTech Duplicators require the use of these Mitsui products because of thickness and composition.  The majority of CD-Rs and DVD-Rs are produce for desk top computers and aren?t suitable for mass production processes.  Duplicators require high quality input media in order to efficiently produce the required volume and quality of output media necessary to support a DoD wide customer base without jamming, distorting or producing otherwise unusable media. Experience has shown that only these Mitsui products work in this process.  A firm fixed price award is anticipated and the estimated cost is [REDACTED].

These products are recommended by the duplicator?s manufacturer and past experience with other media resulted in malfunctions, system shut downs and a wasted dollars.  Most CDs and DVDs are designed for desk top use not mass production.  The Mitsui?s thickness and composition produces the durability needed for success software production.
