<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for continued services to support the NASA GRC Educational Program Office (EPO). The EPO at the NASA GRC is chartered to participate in educational programs and activities to enhance the teaching and student learning of science, mathematics, and technology education. This mission is accomplished through the utilization of NASAs inspiring mission, the unique Glenn laboratories, and the diverse and highly specialized workforce of the GRC. Moreover, the office serves a broad-based community over a six-state mid-West region with these programs, as well as other NASA centers as necessary. All activities further expand NASAs ongoing commitment to contribute the national priorities for educational excellence.	 EPO has a requirement for a highly integrated, vastly skilled program support staff to enable a highly facilitated coordination of multiple organizations and activities.  The support staff has the responsibility of assisting individual Program/Project Managers in the administration of the daily activities necessary to accomplish individual program/project objectives smoothly and cost-effectively. Due to delays in the competitive procurement activity for the NASA Glenn Educational Support Services (ES2) contract, the need to award a purchase order exists to provide the time required for the award of ES2. The EPO support will be incorporated into ES2 in an effort to streamline work efforts and increase productivity in the EPO. Awarding an order for a baseline period of one month with the inclusion of the four option months will allow for the continuation of the necessary services to the GRC EPO. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the services from Paragon TEC, Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Paragon TEC, Inc. represents the only responsible source because of its unique combination of qualifications and experience, its understanding of NASA educational goals and objectives, its knowledge of the EPO mission and its office operations and for being the only source with the wealth of essential experience and combined capabilities to complete the multifaceted effort within the required period of performance. This requirement will be awarded via a purchase order with Paragon TEC. The period of performance will not exceed five months and will be extended by a one-month base period with four one-month options, to be exercised if necessary. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 PM local time on October 26, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a full and open competition basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is a market survey for planning purposes for a potential future opportunity only. This is not a request for Quotations or Proposals. The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding or in any subsequent exchange of information. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned. All interested sources are invited to provide responses to the questionnaire. Please submit responses to the questionnaire electronically as one complete document in the questionnaire structure in a format chosen by the responder.
<p>Project Manager Tactical Radios is seeking industry comments and feedback to the draft Statement of Objectives, draft Statement of Work, draft Performance Requirements Document, draft Contract Data Requirements List, and questionnaire for Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Rifleman Radios (RR). The Rifleman Radio is to be a standalone radio to support controlled unclassified and classified real time intra-squad communications to be employed worldwide in both hostile and non-hostile environments and in a variety of terrain and climatic conditions. The radio will allow Soldiers to participate in doctrinal voice networks and transmit position location information via a networking waveform, the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). <br />NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME. It is currently anticipated that Solicitation W15P7T-12-R-0069 regarding this requirement will be released later in 1QFY13. Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the questionnaire below. The Government does not guarantee that questions received will be answered. Interested parties are invited to subscribe to the website to ensure they receive any important information updates connected with this RFI.</p>
<p>Questionnaire:</p>
<p>Section 1: Contact Information</p>
<p>1-1. Please provide the following Point of Contact Information:<br />Company:<br />Address:<br />Point of Contact:<br />Phone Number:<br />Fax Number:<br />Email Address:<br />DUNS:</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Section 2: Products and Services<br />2-1.Interested sources are highly encouraged to submit detailed comments and feedback regarding the RR draft Statement of Objectives (SOO), draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft Performance Requirements Document (PRD) and draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). These comments are critical for the Government to finalize these documents for the RR Full Rate Production (FRP) Solicitation.</p>
<p>The term "CORE" in the documents defines those items which each offeror is required to provide in order to be eligible for contract award. The offeror shall meet requirements in accordance with Section 3 through 11 of the PRD.</p>
<p>CORE items shall meet or exceed all threshold requirements, indicated by "(t)" prior to the requirement text. Objective requirements, indicated by "(o)" prior to the requirement text, are desired characteristics. Objective requirements need not be met for a product to be technically acceptable for contract award.</p>
<p>Offerors are only guaranteed a contract award if they have a technically acceptable product for all CORE items listed below. A contract award does not guarantee subsequent delivery order awards.</p>
<p>A product's ability to achieve objective requirements will be a discriminator in a tradeoff process for contract award and subsequent delivery order competitions for that product where these technical requirements will be more important than price. <br />The following items are considered "CORE" in the Draft PRD. Requirements can be found in the PRD in the sections referenced below.</p>
<p>A. At least one of the following R/T Units:<br />1. Basic RR R/T Unit (Section 3.1 with all threshold requirements met)<br />or<br />2.

This "White Paper" should provide the number of different products and a description of those solutions their company would be able to submit or propose to meet the RR requirements stated in the draft documents. The PM is also specifically interested in vendor feedback on the draft PRD objective requirements since delivery orders requested under a future contract will use one of more of these objective contract requirements as threshold delivery order requirements.</p>
<p>2-3. The Government is interested in additional networking waveforms that support and enhance the capabilities of the system beyond those specified in section 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2 of the Draft RR FRP PRD.

No hardcopys of this request will be mailed to interested parties. Industrial Base Health Metrics Survey, Request for Information (RFI) Over the past few decades, as the number of propulsion systems development programs have declined, there has been an adverse effect on the health of the propulsion industrial base of the United States and its ability to develop new propulsion systems for civil, military and commercial uses.	 While there have been many studies documenting these effects, the U.S. government needs a method to track the overall health of the industrial base over time. The National Institute of Rocket Propulsion Systems (NIRPS) is a multi-sector, multiple agency organization formed to address such issues as stewardship of the propulsion industrial base, coordination of government efforts in propulsion technology development and to analyze and develop recommendations to lower the overall risks to the propulsion industrial base.  The data collected will be used to track the health of the U.S. propulsion industrial base over time and to develop critical indicators that will be used to predict the possible effects of policy decisions made by the Government.  Additionally the data will be used to inform senior leadership within the Government regarding decisions on policy, propulsion technology development and acquisitions.  Access to submitted data will be limited to the U.S. Government and support contractors with the appropriate nondisclosures on file.  All data marked proprietary by the submitter will be handled accordingly. Responses should be mailed in hard copy to:  Rajiv Doreswamy, Ph.D., NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, Mail Code FP20, MSFC, AL 35812. Please contact Rajiv Doreswamy (rajiv.doreswamy@nasa.gov) with any questions regarding this action. Industrial Base (IB) Questions 1.	Please provide a breakdown of number of degreed (broken out by BS, MS and PhD) and number of non-degreed STEM (Science, Technical Engineering and Mathematics) employees for Rocket Propulsion Systems (RPS) versus years of experience, in 5 year increments, as of 1 October 2002, 2007, and 2012.

<CONTACT>Lisa Walker, Contracting Officer, Phone 303-844-7344, Fax 303-844-2183, Email lisa.walker@ssa.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND INDUSTRY COMMENT
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH to locate commercial firms that either sell commercial products or services, or are capable of developing such, that can integrate with SSA's current identity proofing (IdP) solution to verify the identity of SSA's online customers. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>SSA handles approximately 53 million electronic Service (eService) transactions yearly. This number will increase significantly over the next decade. To facilitate electronic business processes, SSA developed an authentication and identity proofing solution that incorporates the risk of fraudulent use of electronic processes, including improper disclosure, and provides appropriate identity proofing and authentication for online access to its public-facing Internet services. In order to sustain this system, SSA seeks continuous growth and industry feedback to ensure that this remains a competitive self-service solution for its customers. Proper security controls and more robust e-authentication routines provide reliable and accurate outcomes for citizens, businesses and other government agencies that rely upon SSA applications. <br />SSA does not seek full integrators. SSA seeks information on service provider solutions that offer identity proofing and credentialing technology software as a service (SaaS) solutions in the areas of Identity Proofing, Risk-Based Identity proofing, and Out-of-wallet questions in support. <br /><br />SSA seeks information on vendors ability to provide authentication technology solutions that are compatible with its current solution providing Identity Proofing, Risk-Based Authentication, and Out-of-Wallet (OOW) Data.</p>
<p>&bull;For OOW data, SSA requests the following detailed information: OOW question categories, minimum and maximum number of questions available in a library, diversity of questions, success rate of OOW questions in US and US territories, and maintenance of OOW questions.</p>
<p>&bull;For Identity Proofing, SSA is seeking information on address verification (domestic and foreign). For domestic address, SSA seeks information on the pass rate by state and US territories as well as pass rate for military postal addresses. For foreign address verification, SSA seeks information on the ability to match foreign addresses and the success rate, if available. Additionally, SSA seeks information on foreign language options in the service provider's solution and the ability to support special characters and spaces for name, city, state, and street addresses, as well as transition support.</p>
<p>&bull;For risk-based authentication, SSA seeks information on software solutions that are capable of identifying fraudulent and/or stolen identities, and how often the information to detect these identities is updated.</p>
<p>SSA is interested in highly reliable, adaptive solutions that will meet all technical and operational requirements specified below and within the draft statement of work (see attached).<br />Any potential vendor solution must support:</p>
<p>&#61607; Seamless Integration within the SSA identity-proofing framework utilizing secure, open standards in order to reduce the impact of solution implementation upon SSA and its customers;</p>
<p>&#61607; Identity Proofing: the e-authentication process by which an assertion of an identity is verified;</p>
<p>&#61607; Risk-Based Authentication: a technique that uses both contextual and historical user information, along with data supplied during an Internet transaction, to assess authenticity of a user interaction; and</p>
<p>&#61607; Out-of-Wallet Data: refers to private data used for authentication activities, e.g., any personal information that cannot be found in a person's wallet. "Out-of-wallet" data may be drawn from public, publicly available and non-public proprietary databases. A typical out-of-wallet question may be based on information taken from a credit report, such as the name of the company that issued your home loan.</p>
<p>&#61607; Transition Plan: refers to a seamless phase-in and phase-out plan to transition into SSA's current architecture by working with the current vendor and/or the incoming vendor to implement the new solution. In addition to the functionality integration during the transition period, SSA seeks information on the timeframes needed to transition (e.g. planning and analysis and development), level of effort, and potential costs.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES</p>
<p>Interested and capable parties are invited to submit information in response to this notice. All responses must include the following information in their responses:</p>
<p>&#61607; A description of how the solution satisfies SSA's technical requirements. This description must include the factors, elements, and process used to generate a risk score in support of the Risk-Based Authentication requirements;</p>
<p>&#61607; A description of how the solution will integrate with SSA systems, while conforming to applicable standards, transports, and protocols described within this solicitation;</p>
<p>&#61607; A description of how the solution's performance, security, and reliability will be monitored, maintained, reported, and potentially improved to satisfy SSA requirements;</p>
<p>&#61607; A general project plan that defines how the general levels of effort required on the vendor's part to implement the solution, the estimated duration to implement the solution, the types of key personnel required to implement and maintain the solution, and a description of the anticipated level of SSA personnel's involvement in implementing and maintaining the solution.</p>
<p>&#61607; Any additional relevant information on quality assurance, warranties, or guarantees of performance of the solution.</p>
<p>&#61607; A comprehensive list of Out-of-Wallet questions the vendor will employ that is sufficient to verify identity during the authentication process.</p>
<p>&#61607; A clear description of how the vendor will provide access to information that supports authentication requirements specified within NIST Special Publication 800-63, such as address and financial information [e.g., credit card numbers, banking account numbers (checking, savings), loan information (home, car, student)]. SSA seeks evidence of a vendor's ability to deliver the broadest range of identity verification data to support the authentication of a highly diverse customer base.</p>
<p>&#61607; A description of how the vendor's solution is commonly sold in the commercial marketplace (e.g., initial price approaches, user license based, transaction based recurring pricing, price policies for solution maintenance, hourly or engagement based services pricing). Vendors should also indicate whether their services/products are available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), and if applicable provide the relevant contract numbers.</p>
<p>&#61607; Examples of relevant corporate and government past performance information that demonstrates the vendor's previous success in delivering solutions of similar size, scope, and complexity in the government or commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>Vendors are invited to submit complete responses to this notice and make advisory comment on the attached draft statement of work document. Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used in SSA's market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. Requests for copies of a solicitation at this time will not be acknowledged.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted in an electronic format (compatible with Microsoft Office 2010) via e-mail to the Contract Specialist. Responses shall not exceed 20 pages. SSA will not review responses that do not comply with its requirements. Faxed information will not be considered. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes.</p>

<p>As a result of Sources Sought, posted on FBO on 21 Mar 2012, besides Perkin Elmer Health Sciences, Inc., only one response was received. The responding firm was an authorized dealer of Perkin Elmer equipments and was not able to perform more than 50% of the requirement without subcontracting to the OEM, Perkin Elmer Health Sciences, Inc.

The Period of Performance (POP) for this requirement will be from 7 December 2012 to 6 December, 2017 to include one basic year and four option years. The anticipated award date will be Dec 06, 2012. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and such time until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for quotes nor a solicitation of offers; however, all proposals received within three days after date of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed by the Government for future considerations. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating a vendor's bona fide capability to provide these required services. Requests must include company name, address, telephone and facsimile number, e-mail address, cage code and business size of the requester. All proposals should be submitted via e-mail to A1C Lei Yang at lei.yang@hill.af.mil, no later than Nov 01, 2012 at 2:00pm Mountain Standard Time.

<DESC>Proposers' Day Announcement for the IARPA Bio-Intelligence Chips (BIC) Program - IARPA-BAA-13-04<br />Solicitation Number: IARPA-BAA-13-04<br />Agency: Office of the Director of National Intelligence<br />Office: Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, Safe and Secure Operations Office
<p><br /><strong>SYNOPSIS:<br /></strong>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Bio-Intelligence Chips (BIC) Program on November 15, 2012 in anticipation of the release of a new program solicitation. The conference will be held from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference is to provide information on the BIC concept, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.<br />This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:<br /></strong>The human adaptive immune system is known to carry a long-term memory of its exposure to antigens, i.e., molecules derived from the chemical constituents of pathogenic organisms and viruses. Human immune memory resides in T and B memory cells (lymphocytes), and also in plasma cells that secrete circulating antibodies into the bloodstream directed against specific antigens. Vaccines, which are designed to provoke lasting responses that can lead to disease resistance, purposefully stimulate the adaptive immune system. Immune memory can be extremely long-lived. Certain forms of persistent response have already been well established through biomedical research, while other forms remain less well characterized at the present.</p>
<p>IARPA is interested in the human physiological changes resulting from chemical, radiological and biological exposures reflected in omni-omic signatures1, i.e., immunological, transcriptional, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, epigenetic and microbiomic characteristics. BIC envisions developing an understanding of how such exposures present within an array of biological functions can be used to build a biological response signature.</p>
<p>The goal of the BIC program is to develop portable Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platforms that provide simultaneous read-out and analysis of omni-omic signatures. The BIC program will be a multiple phase program that will develop revolutionary biotechnology for lab-on-a-chip platforms to determine the exposure status of an individual to a suite of pathogens and toxins of interest. Further, the BIC program will develop integrated LOCs that can determine exposures to industrial chemicals, toxins, and radiological materials. LOCs that can detect and identify proteins, DNA, miRNA, siRNA, and small molecules such as certain pharmaceutical agents, nerve agents and toxic industrial chemicals simultaneously are therefore important to the BIC program. Analyses should be done with high reliability and based on the collection of a small (microliters) blood sample, or secretory sample (saliva or urine specimen). Multiple methods of detection such as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), nano-resonators, molecular beacons, ion mobility, fluorescence, or other ultra-sensitive read-out modalities should be considered for orthogonal identification of analytes.</p>
<p>The BIC program will develop hardware and bioassays and methods to gather bio-intelligence in the field. The BIC program will require aggressive research and advancements in LOC technologies (e.g., digital microfluidics) and omni-omic signature identification and correlation. The LOC platforms should be able to provide end-to-end sample processing from sample in to analyzed output in less than 10 minutes in a handheld device.</p>
<p>At a minimum the LOC platforms will require sample clean-up and pre-processing, automated operation, potential for single molecule detection, orthogonal multi-analyte detection modalities to minimize false alarm rates, and automated analysis/reporting output. Omni-omic signature databases will need to be developed that provide statistical relevance, minimize false positives, and provide confidence factors from correlated data.</p>
<p>The vision of the BIC program is to develop revolutionary technologies for omni-omic detection and analysis that provide answers to the following questions, among others:<br />1) What information can be gathered about human exposure to dangerous chemicals, radiological materials, and/or biological pathogens by examining an individual's omni-omic signature?<br />2) Can we determine the exposure history (temporal) of an individual based on assessment of his or her omni-omic signature?<br />3) Algorithms: Is it possible to differentiate between vaccination and natural exposure to a biological pathogen using an omni-omic approach?<br />4) Bio-Assay Design: What are the absolute or potential show-stoppers (e.g., cross-reactivity of epitopes) for developing a rapid (&lt; 10 min), lab-on-a-chip, multiplex assay that relies on binding interactions between receptor molecules (probes) and their corresponding epitopes/glycotopes exposed on the analyte? What means might be developed to overcome such show-stoppers?<br />5) Bio-Assay Design: What are the key challenges with bioinformatics tools presently available for epitope (conformational and linear) and glycotope predictions? Using the present tools, how long might it take to design reliable probes for newly discovered organisms at the strain level? What technologies/methods might be developed to decrease the design time?<br />6) Automation: What are the challenges associated with developing a reconfigurable digital microfluidic chip that can be programmed to assay for a specific bioagent of interest on the fly?<br />7) Sample pre-processing: Given that protein extraction efficiency is typically 40% on-chip, what are some scalable methods that would enable achieving close to 100% extraction efficiency (similar to macro-scale extraction)?<br />8) Sample pre-processing: What is the best separation resolution that on-chip techniques can accomplish rapidly?<br />9) Detection: How does functionalization chemistry affect detection limit in pre-processed and raw blood, saliva, urine for a model protein? How important is the surface density and orientation of the receptor molecule? From a QA/QC perspective, are these parameters variable enough such that measurements of both (surface density and orientation) for specification-compliance would be necessary?<br />10) Detection: If the input analyte concentration is very low and one needs to ensure that each analyte is released after capture, how would one reverse the binding of an analyte? Can this or has this been done at the level of a single molecule within a single droplet or vesicle?<br />11) Detection: Several types of resonators have enhanced zones versus dead zones in which sensing are not possible. This suggests that patterned or directed functionalization of receptor molecules on resonators would be beneficial. What are some of the promising ways to perform patterned or directed functionalization en masse? Upon functionalization, are resonator qualities degraded?<br />12) To preserve a small biological sample on-chip for later analysis, what preservatives are readily available for preserving proteins in non-refrigerated environments? What is their period of reliability? Do new preservatives need to be developed?</p>
<p>The BIC program aims to provide innovative contributions in the following areas: 1) real human sample clean-up and pre-processing, 2) bioassay development, 3) digital microfluidic controls, 4) rapid detection and readout of at least one bioassay, and 5) information processing and correlation.</p>
<p>Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with capabilities including, but not limited to, lab-on-a-chip design, bioassay development, diagnostic instrumentation/equipment design, bio-technology, and immunology. Team members should complement each other's technical expertise and resources.</p>
<p>IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program.</p>
<p><br /><strong>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br /></strong>Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern November 01, 2012 at http://events.Signup4.com/BICPD_Registration.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO 9) intends to award a sole source contract award to ChemDaq Inc., 300 Business Center Drive, Wauwatosa, Pittsburgh, PA 15205. The Period of Performance for Contract Award will be one (1) twelve (12) month period, with four (4), twelve (12) month option periods.

This requirement is for equipment to be serviced/maintained which includes ChemDaq Steri-Trac System but not limited to: Ethylene Oxide ( EtO) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Monitoring System to include the computer, remote controls, and sensor exchange every 4 months. There are four (4) EtO and two (2) H202 sensors,  EE# 51119, S/N 20080929D026.  Equipment is located in the SPS at VA Medical Center, 1101 Veterans Drive, Lexington, Ky.  Required service shall ensure that the equipment functions in conformance with manufacturer specifications and the latest published editions of NFPA-99 and OSHA. This includes performance standards and specifications used when the ChemDaq system was procured and any upgrades / updates thereafter.   Required services are not available via the contractor's FSS contract and, therefore, will be incorporated as open market items in accordance with FAR 8.402(f).
ChemDaq is the sole manufacturer of the EtO and H2O2 sensors that are used with the Steri-Trac system.  They are unique in the fact that the sensors are calibrated the day before they are shipped and adjustments aren't required once they arrive at the facility.  The sensors are exchanged every four (4) months to eliminate failures and false alarms that can cause lost productivity if SPS has to be evacuated.  The criticality of ensuring the sensors are properly calibrated to the specific gases is the key to having a reliable monitoring / alarm system to warn staff of any gases within the environment.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date and time. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award. Responses are due by October 24, 2012, 10:00 p.m. (EDT). Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to matthew.whisman@va.gov. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>DIRECTOR OF YOUTH MINISTRY<br />For<br />YOUTH OF THE CHAPEL PROGRAM
<p>1. General. The Youth of the Chapel (YOC) Program falls under the Installation Senior Chaplain's Program as defined in the Command Master Religious Program (CMRP). The mission of the Chaplain's program is to provide for religious support needs, to include religiously based youth study and outreach programs, of all assigned Soldiers, civilians, and Family members (see AR 165-1). The YOC program is a basic religious education program. The primary goal of the YOC program is to provide basic religious understanding of life events through fellowship activities, youth meetings and events, Bible studies, retreats, camps and mentoring programs involving youth of assigned installation personnel. The Installation Senior Chaplain is responsible for basic youth religious education to include denominational faith development and faith sustainment requirements. The specific and professional Youth Religious Activities services required by this contract supplement the basic religious education YOC programs conducted by the Chaplain. Persons providing Youth Religious Activities services are professionally trained specialists in youth activities. The individual providing the services of this contract, either as an individual non-personal services contactor, or as an employee of a vendor contracted to provide such services, is not a member of the Installation Senior Chaplain's Office staff nor employee of the Government. The Director of Youth Ministry provides these services under the direction of the Installation Senior Chaplain.</p>
<p>2. Scope of Work. The purpose of the Youth Religious Activities services non-personal services contract is to provide appropriate opportunities for the middle school (grades 6-8) and senior high school (grades 9-12) students to develop a pluralistic, spiritually or religiously based framework for daily living. Youth Religious Activities services are specifically non-denominational in scope, applied within a pluralistic military community environment, and must accommodate the free exercise needs of all participants. The need for specialized Youth Religious Activities is outlined in AR165-1. Agencies (individuals or organizations) providing specialized, professional Youth Religious Activities (herein referred to as the "Contractor") will provide weekly youth meetings for middle and senior high school youth of assigned installation personnel and conduct other youth religious activities to include community projects, retreats and camps, and mentoring programs. The Contractor shall perform promotional endeavors and advertising campaigns, maintain adequate records of functions, attendance, and materials needed, project the timely supply of needed material and classroom supplies for study events and/or youth meetings, conduct volunteer training and youth leader development classes, and answer community inquiries regarding the youth of the chapel activities and outreach programs.<br />***See Performance Work Statement***</p>

<p>a. The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Award will be made on the basis of determining offerors who meet or exceed the salient characteristics listed on a pass/fail basis and those offerors who pass (meeting salient characteristics) will then be evaluated on who offered the lowest evaluated price which meets or exceeds the requirements. If an offeror does not meet the salient characteristics, it will not be considered. The offeror of an "or equal" item must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its products meets or exceeds the salient characteristics in accordance with the provision at FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or equal.<br /><br />In addition, quotes will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (multiple awards). It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating quotes, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs. If multiple awards are used, no one contract will be awarded for less than $3,000.00.</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>WAWF Invoicing Instructions:</p>
<p>The required method for submission of invoices is electronic invoicing with electronic funds transfer (EFT). DFARS Clause 252.232.7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests has been included in the contract which mandates electronic invoicing. If a hard copy invoice is received by Defense Finance and Accounting System (DFAS) it will be rejected back to the vendor for non-compliance with the contract. DFAS requires the use of Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). More information about WAWF is available at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and http://www.dod.mil/dfas/.</p>
<p>Before you can use WAWF, you must self register at : https://wawf.eb.mil/. If your company is new to WAWF, click on "Help with registration" link. To create an invoice in WAWF, you must decide what type of document to create. For this contract the vendor must use the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) with the correct purchase order/contract/delivery order number. If the contract information is available in the system, then WAWF will automatically populate some of the data. If the contract information is not available, WAWF gives a warning message. The warning message allows the vendor to validate that the contract number was entered correctly. If the contract number has been entered correctly and the contract is not found in the system, the vendor should click "OK" and to continue creating the invoice entering the necessary data manually.</p>
<p>Vendors need to have a hard copy of the contract, either form SF 1449 or form DD 1155 before you process your invoice in WAWF. Three DoDAACs must be entered in WAWF. They are the Admin DoDAAC, Ship to DoDAAC (also called the receiving/acceptance point) , and Payment Office DoDAAC. The Issued By DoDAAC and Inspected By DoDAAC fields can be left blank.<br />For your convenience the correct codes are identified below:</p>
<p>Admin DoDAAC = FA7000 (found in Block 9 on the SF1449 or Block 6 on the DD1155)<br />Ship to DoDAAC = FX7000 (found in Block 15 on the SF1449 or Block 14 on the DD1155)<br />Payment DoDAAC = F67100 (Found in Block 18a on the SF1449 or Block 15 on the DD1155)</p>
<p>Besides the DoDAACs, you must also enter the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). This is a four to six digit number such as 0001 or 0001AA. It is important to enter the correct CLIN with the associated dollar amount. Some contracts have more than one CLIN, so each CLIN must be entered.<br /><br />The vendor may use a system called "My Invoice" to see if the invoice payment has been scheduled. The web address is https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil//index.html. Payment information is loaded under the DUNS number.</p>
<p>For more information about WAWF, go to the Web-Based Training Website http://wawftraining.com. Also, the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide may be helpful. If you have questions about WAWF, please contact the Help Desk at (866) 618-5988 or (801) 605-7095 or email: cscassig@csd.disa.mil.</p>

<DESC><strong>AG-3395-S-13-0006</strong> is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations and the documents incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. <br /><br />This procurement is set aside for Small Businesses. The NAICS code is 238910 and the Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 million average annual receipts over three years.
<p><br />The <strong>George Washington and Jefferson National Forests in Virginia (GWJ</strong>) is seeking to form Blanket Purchase Agreements with small businesses to furnish <strong>EQUIPMENT RENTAL WITH OPERATOR, ON AN HOURLY, TIME AND MATERIALS BASIS. RESPONSES WILL BE DUE BY 4:30 p.m., NOVEMBER 20, 2012.</strong> Vendors should submit a by-the-hour pricing list for the equipment listed in the solicitation, and for any unlisted equipment available to the contractor which may be of use to the Government during the performance of heavy and civil engineering work ranging from culvert repair or replacement, fill material placement, slide/debris removal, road repair, and/or similar work to roads, bridges, established recreation areas, or any other reasonable developed location within the Forests' administrative boundaries. Interested vendors are not required to submit pricing for every piece of equipment listed in this solicitation.</p>
<p>&bull; Award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement will be based upon prices submitted, past performance and experience. Three to five BPAs are expected to be awarded for each District (the Government reserves the right to award more or fewer depending upon responses received). <br />&bull; Work may be awarded non-competitively to BPA holders under the micro-purchase threshold of $2,500. Work will be competed as described in the Blanket Purchase Agreement among the BPA holders for each District between $2,500 and $25,000. <br />&bull; Awarded Task Orders will be subject to the Service Contract Act.<br />&bull; Single Task Orders could range from $2,500 to as much as $25,000, depending on the circumstances necessitating the order and the work needing to be accomplished. <br />&bull; Estimated dollar value of work to be ordered is expected to range from approximately $20,000 to $50,000 per District per year. <br />&bull; ACTUAL value of orders placed under an agreement will vary significantly within these numbers, depending on contingencies such as unusually severe weather in one area, available budget, and evolving management priorities. <br />&bull; Effective period of each agreement will be five years or until the total spent under the agreement is $150,000 (whichever is sooner), or until termination of the agreement in writing by either the Government or the Vendor. <br />&bull; Blanket Purchase Agreements are not binding contractual documents, but Task Orders awarded under the Agreements will be binding contracts. <br />&bull; A solicitation for new vendors interested in participating in the competitive BPA competitive for this work will be issued in Fiscal Year 2014, and in each succeeding year, in response to which new agreements may be added to the competitive pool. This will be the only solicitation for vendors interested in holding a BPA advertised during Fiscal Year 2013.</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation. This procurement shall be conducted utilizing a combination of technically acceptable baseline requirements and a tradeoff of past performance, predefined qualitative value characteristics, and cost/price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: -Technical Acceptability -Past Performance -Predefined Qualitative Value Characteristics -Cost/Price 1. Technical Acceptability The baseline shall be evaluated for the complete and adequate response to the SOW. The technical requirements will be rated as either meets requirements or does not meet requirements. 2. Past Performance Past Performance indicates how well an offeror performed on earlier work and can be a significant indicator of how well it can be expected to perform the work at hand. The offerors past performance including recent experience will be evaluated by the buying team. The evaluation will be based on information provided by offerors in their proposals, information obtained by the buying team based on communications with listed references as well as any other information obtained independently by the buying team. Past Performance for the offeror (add and major subcontractors, if applicable) will be evaluated and rated as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor*. If an offeror has no past performance experience, it will be given a neutral rating. 3. Predefined Qualitative Value Characteristics (VC) All offers will be judged against the qualitative characteristics. Only items specifically proposed as Qualitative Value Characteristics will be evaluated as such. The following Predefined Qualitative Value Characteristics are applicable to this procurement and will be evaluated and rated as adding no value, adding minimal value, or adding significant value. A. The event planner's demonstrated history of successful planning and coordination in scientific and basic research conferences. B. The event planner's demonstrated history of receipt, coordination, and distribution of scientific abstracts to conference participants. C. Access to robust software that will accommodate 400 abstracts and allow multiple users to plan, organize and schedule all sessions for abstracts. 4. Tradeoff Process 1. If all offers are of approximately equal merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest most probable cost. 2. The Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. 3. The Government will consider making award to an offeror whose offer has lower merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. 4. Technical requirements and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against the value characteristics listed in paragraph 3, which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements. The value characteristics are performance-based and permit selection of the offer which provides better results for a reasonable increase in price. Cost and technical capability will be considered equal in importance and will not be assigned weights. On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation. Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3 (APR 2012), Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. These may be obtained via the internet at URL: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/52-212-plusadd.pdf    . These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract. NASA Clause 1852.215-84 (NOV 2011), Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this request for quotes.
USHMM shall award a purchase order subject to availability of FY13 funds. <BR> <BR>Inquiries, questions, and all correspondence concerning this solicitation document should be submitted via FedBid, referencing USHMM RFQ-9531-13-R-0075.  No verbal modifications will be considered.  All questions must reference specific parts of the solicitation including page numbers and will only be received until Wednesday, October 24th, 2012, at 11:00 AM ET.  Replies will be made in writing, and distributed to all vendors via FedBid posting. <BR> <BR>Offerors shall propose an itemized payment schedule which ties reasonable, performance-related progress payments to Museum-accepted delivery of goods and services, while withholding a 10% retainage of the total project price pending satisfactory completion of contract performance.  Contractor warrants that the prices for the supplies and services under this Contract are not greater than the prices charged the Contractor's most favorable customer under similar circumstances. <BR> <BR>To be considered for award, all Sellers must be manufacturer federally authorized distributors and/or resellers of the equipment/services they are offering with a demonstrated capability of delivering the entire order within the timeframes specified by the Buyer on the award. Sellers will be required to provide documentation as proof of authorization to be considered for award.  Please send this documentation to FedBid?s client services team (clientservices@fedbid.com) prior to the close of this Buy. <BR> <BR>The equipment sought by USHMM herein is intended to serve as backup/replacement units for existing hardware inventory. Vendors offering alternative product(s) should note that USHMM uses an AMX controller system that is already pre-programmed for this particular unit. Consideration of pricing competitiveness would therefore have to account for the costs of reprogramming/reconfiguring the AMX controller at least twice. Offerors bidding equipment other than that pre-specified by USHMM bear the burden of justifying/narratively demonstrating compliance, cost competitiveness, and best value of their respective good(s). <BR> <BR>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Air Force Research Laboratory<br />Munitions Directorate <br />101 W. Eglin Blvd <br />Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Armament Technology</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Amendment #1 to BAA-RWK-2013-0001, dated 01 Oct 2012</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-RWK-2013-0001</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S): 12.800 Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME: This BAA will remain open through 30 Sep 2013, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. It is recommended that prior to submission of any white papers, each submitter should consult with the technical POC for each respective research area to discuss the topic of interest. White papers may be submitted at any time during the open period to afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil.</p>
<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>This acquisition is unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of this solicitation. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712 (for Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), and the small business size standard is 500 employees (1000 employees for Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their propulsion units, propulsion unit parts, and auxiliary equipment and parts).</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Weapons Program Offices. There are three divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Ordnance Division, the Strategic Planning and Integration Division, and the Weapon Engagement Sciences Division.</p>
<p>ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)</p>
<p>The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV). Recent AF Core Functional Master Plan has led to technology needs in support of high velocity penetrating weapons, air superiority, long range strike and high speed strike platforms, and future capability for functional defeat. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from a fundamental understanding of detonation and reaction processes for the formation of damage mechanisms (i.e., directed fragmentation fields, multi-phase blast) to ordnance system survivability and end-game performance (e.g. sled track verification and/or arena characterization for later lethality estimates). Specific research interests are in the shock response and equation of state for the damage mechanism materials, including inert, reactive, and explosives; relevant target materials and improved constitutive strength descriptions; fracture and fragmentation; penetration mechanics; and improving the suite of diagnostics to best extract the high-rate and violent environments of these ordnance systems. Current specific interests reside in multi-functional materials, such as those possessing structural benefits as well as contributing to the energy-on-target for the most efficient of weapon designs. Also desired are highly agile and end-game responsive adaptation to the weapon-on-target conditions; tailorable output that ensures optimal energy use while limiting collateral damage</p>
<p>STRATEGIC PLANNING AND INTEGRATION DIVISION (RWP)</p>
<p>The Strategic Planning and Integration Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB) and the Capability Integration Branch (RWPI).</p>
<p>WEAPON ENGAGEMENT SCIENCES DIVISION (RWW)</p>
<p>The Weapon Engagement Sciences Division (RWW) directs and conducts basic, exploratory, and advanced development research in weapon terminal seeker science and munitions aerodynamics, guidance navigation and control to include algorithms, processors, control loops, and airframes for affordable air-to-air and air-to surface conventional munitions. Munitions Systems Effects Sciences area conducts research on a broad range of leading edge modeling and simulation activities that allows the evaluation of system level performance and effectiveness of advanced munitions concepts through high-fidelity, ground testing. Much of the technology focus is on autonomous precision-guided air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, with decreased susceptibility to counter measures, improved weather performance, enhanced utility, and decreased cost. The Division is comprised of the following organizational branches to conduct this mission: Computation Mechanics (RWWC), Integrated Guidance Simulations (RWWG), Integrated Sensing and Processing (RWWI), Lethality and Vulnerability (RWWL), Weapon Dynamics and Control Sciences (RWWN), Weapon Seeker Sciences (RWWS), and Munitions Aerodynamics Sciences (RWWV).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the 18 prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p>RESEARCH AREA 1 - WEAPON AIRFRAME SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWWV)</p>
<p>Advances in weapon airframe systems technologies are required to take advantage of emerging developments in weapon guidance systems, networked information systems, and precision effect ordnance systems. The goal of this work is to perform research on technologies for development of agile weapon airframes that are capable of being deployed or dispensed from manned and unmanned platforms (e.g., 5th-6th generation fighters) and that are capable of delivering precision controlled effects against fixed and mobile ground targets and air targets in high uncertainty engagement scenarios. Enabling technologies in the following research areas are of interest: agile weapon airframes for all flight regimes; high agility airframes capable of aggressive but controlled post-stall flight maneuvers; robust, low-cost, compact control and actuation systems (aero and propulsive) for small weapons; composable/fractionable weapon systems; compact power for small weapons; small weapon design, carriage, and dispensing technology; and compressed carriage munitions. Airframe technology research efforts should have a sound basis in credible theories, principles and methodologies of dynamical systems, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, materials, propulsion, and flight mechanics; should exploit advances in other weapon technologies (e.g., advanced sensors and seekers, guidance and control algorithms, networked enabled weapons and information architectures, controlled effects ordnance, etc.); should be amenable to further development through sound principles of systems engineering; and should offer the potential for significantly improving affordable weapon aerial systems capabilities, effectiveness and reliabilities. In the context of this research area, innovative and novel concepts based upon emerging science and technology are encouraged; incremental evolution of existing technologies are of low interest.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL (RWWI)</p>
<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWWI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Weapon Engagement Sciences Division.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 3 - AUTONOMOUS TARGET RECOGNITION (RWWI)</p>
<p>RWWI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 4 - HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES (RWWG)</p>
<p>RWWG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWWG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement and improvements to scene projection/projector technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, millimeter-wave simulators, cryogenic chamber simulator, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 5 - ADVANCED SCENE GENERATION (RWWG)</p>
<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 6 - LADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWWS)</p>
<p>RWWS has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging ladar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices. Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation. Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWWN)</p>
<p>RWWN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 8 - MODELING, SIMULATION, &amp; ANALYSIS (MS&amp;A) OF ADVANCED WEAPON CONCEPTS (RWWL)</p>
<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and novel destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered. Additionally, environmental factors that influence a weapons performance can be considered. This can include but not be limited to urban environments, collaborative simulation environments, A@AD type environments, scenario generation and infrastructure simulation common to environments that weapons may operate in. Existing tools of interest include, but are not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB/Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, and STORM. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be performed on-site (e.g. at the Government facility) and security clearances at the SECRET level will be required.</p>

<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models as well as advanced methodologies to capture the physics of structural response to conventional weapon effects would improve our abilities to assess current and conceptual weapons and ways to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, CUSP, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. In addition, to the existing toolset, new methods for integrating high-fidelity computational physics capability while minimizing CPU and/or clock time would provide enhanced predictive proficiency. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWWC)</p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 11 - DAMAGE MECHANISMS RESEARCH (RWMW)</p>
<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects of conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cyber net neutralization. Specific research interests are in the shock response and equation of state for the damage mechanism materials, including inert, reactive, and explosives; relevant target materials and improved constitutive strength descriptions; fracture and fragmentation; penetration mechanics; and improving the suite of diagnostics to best extract the high-rate and violent environments of these ordnance systems. Current specific interests reside in multi-functional materials, such as those possessing structural benefits as well as contributing to the energy-on-target for the most efficient of weapon designs. Ordnance package integration and optimized system response of shared capabilities is of interest. Also desired are highly agile and end-game responsive adaptation to the weapon-on-target conditions and tailorable output that ensures optimal energy use while limiting collateral damage. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)</p>
<p>RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.</p>
<p>RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related component or material technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead. Materials that mitigate all or some portion of the shock spectrum are also of interest. Unique inertial detection devices or non-inertial detection devices are of interest. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, there is interest in laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks. Additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop miniature, shock hardened transmitter and antenna to burst stored digital data upon command to retrieve post event recorded data from a buried warhead. It would also be useful for the purpose of locating a test item.</p>
<p>RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing (as defined in Mil-Std-1316) for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>- Reliable miniature three port air valve with a temperature operating range of -55 to +<br />75 degree C<br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology</p>
<p>The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Advanced Initiation Science group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in modeling and simulation methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 13 - MUNITIONS ENERGETIC MATERIALS (RWME)</p>
<p>Munitions Energetic Materials is concerned with (1) the formulation, manufacturing, and producibility; (2) the characterization and phenomenology; and (3) the theoretical energetics and design for explosives and energetic materials for munition applications. This topic includes development of explosive formulations to address impact, thermal, and vibration survivability; energetic materials, including nanometric explosives with higher energy density than traditional explosives. Reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives are also included. Use of computational tools to predict formulation properties, including survivability and processing, is of interest. Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well. Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of energetic materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</p>
<p>AFRL/RWME anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetics. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p><br />RESEARCH AREA 15 - MULTI-FUNCTION, MULTI-MODE RADAR RESEARCH (RWWS)</p>
<p>RWWS has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs). There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWWS is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology (conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance Integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. A goal of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and novel - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Novel warhead approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced loss of life and/or different defeat mechanisms.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed.</p>

[Programs that fall mostly within Higher Education and Professional Development]</p>
<p>The overall objectives to assist in developing the framework for proposal are as follows:</p>
<p>* Establish and ensure successful, sustainable, and affordable long-term education outreach programs targeted to K-12 schools as well institutions of higher learning. <br />* Establish and maintain a pipeline of students, particularly women and members of minority groups, who will participate in education and outreach programs. <br />* Increase the number of domestic students (particularly students from under-represented groups) completing STEM degrees through enhancing student interest and attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. <br />* Strengthen peer, family, and school support for such interests. <br />* Ensure long-term inclusiveness of women and minorities in science and technology programs. <br />* Increase the number of students taking college-prep STEM oriented courses. <br />* Demonstrate appropriate curricular connections with the applicable state and national standards of learning for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. <br />* Strengthen the resources and training related to STEM offered to teachers.<br />* Increase the awareness of and exposure to Air Force relevant STEM content, research experience and career options through education and outreach programs.</p>
<p>Education outreach activities supported may include providing financial assistance to organizations supporting STEM activities, providing funding and support for national competitions by arranging for DoD personnel to participate as speakers, mentors, coaches, judges and presenters, providing support for STEM education and outreach conferences and supporting teacher STEM education and training initiatives. Stipends for teachers undertaking professional training in connection with these activities may be supported as well as funding for the acquisition of materials and resources needed to launch, implement, assess, and improve the STEM oriented programs. AFRL encourages the projects and program results to be published in appropriate publications and academic journals at the end of the period of performance. Participants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches that utilize their unique assets, capabilities, locations, and personnel. White papers should identify projects/programs and methods that will be used to foster and develop students in STEM fields that are relevant to the DoD mission.</p>

<p>RESEARCH AREA 18 - WEAPONS AUTONOMY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWWN)</p>
<p>RWWN is interested in novel hardware, software and algorithms to support and enable autonomous weapon concepts and capabilities especially in highly-contested environments. Novel bio-inspired sensing and wide-field of view seeker hardware are desired to create improved situational awareness as well as improved integrated sensing-control algorithms. Test and evaluation hardware and scene generation technology are also desired for distributed aperture and wide-field sensing. Limited communication in contested environments might require decentralized, high-level cognitive functions: technologies that enable context-aware reasoning, multi-agent coordination, graceful performance degradation, and inherently flexible or reconfigurable operation are highly desired. Unified architectures or mathematical languages applicable to the control and coordination of heterogeneous information services and that enable verifiable, trusted autonomy are also sought. Network-aware capabilities, especially technology that cognitively matches machines with human oversight, would enable trusted cooperation and increased capacity for autonomous weapon deployment. Finally, science and technology that allows for fractionated weapon performance (having capability spread across multiple assets that coordinate to deliver a desired effect) and composable functions (where disparate capabilities can be combined synergistically to create multiple desired effects) are also of interest.</p>

<p>c. Factor 3: ROM commensurate with technical approach.</p>
<p>B. Proposal Evaluation Criteria: If white paper is selected for further consideration, the following 4 Factors, listed in descending order of importance (cost/price, although ranked 4th, is a substantial factor), will be used to determine if a contract is to be awarded:</p>
<p>1. Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>a. Factor 1: An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the three AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 18 research areas.</p>
<p>b. Factor 2: The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the formal proposal.</p>
<p>c. Factor 3: The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives presented in the formal proposal.</p>
<p>d. Factor 4: The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).</p>
<p>2. Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk for technical, cost, and schedule will be assessed for formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance. Risk Drivers and Risk Mitigation are not necessarily part of Research Area 16, Revolutionary Research. Risk may be assessed as High; Moderate, or Low; however, high risk, revolutionary ideas that change paradigms are sought.</p>
<p>3. Review and Selection Process: The evaluation described above will generally result in proposals being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p>a. Category I: Demonstrates technical merit. Is important to agency programs. The offeror presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>b. Category II: Demonstrates technical merit; is important to agency programs; and presents relevant experience and access to adequate resources; but requires further development. Risk is acceptable. The cost/price is reasonable and realistic. Category II proposals are recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>c. Category III: Does not demonstrate technical merit; does not meet agency needs; does not present adequate experience or resources; the risk level is unacceptable; or the cost/price is not reasonable or realistic.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>A. Award Notices (White Papers): Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 calendar days after submission.</p>
<p>B. Award Notices (full proposals): Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>D. Reporting: Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.</p>
<p>E. Data Rights Assertions: It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to any contracts awarded under this BAA. Any data delivered or anticipated to be delivered with less than unlimited rights must be reported in a separate, appropriately marked appendix to the final report of any awarded contract resulting from this BAA.</p>
<p>F. Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP): Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP. If required as a part of a resulting contract from this BAA, AFFARS 5352.223-9001 mandates that adequate health and safety requirements be identified in the contract. Contractors can gain more information regarding the OSHA VPP Program at <br />http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/index.html.</p>

<p>C. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer listed above for resolution. <br />AFFARS 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Barbara Gehrs<br />Director of Contracting (AFRL/PK)<br />Phone: (937) 904-4407<br />Email: barbara.gehrs@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</p>
<p>A. Support Contractors: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:<br /><br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.</p>
<p>Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>B. Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>C. Debriefings (Proposals Only): When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p>E. Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation (Jun 2011), which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html. The contract will also include DFARS 252.211-7007, Reporting of Government-Furnished Property (Aug 2012).</p>
<p>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements: If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) and Forward Pricing Rate Recommendations (FPRRs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p>G. Pre-Award Clearance: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p>H. Limitations on Pass-Through Charges: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at FAR 52.215-23, Limitations on Pass-Through Charges (Oct 2009), which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor.</p>
<p>I. Associate Contractor Agreements: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on Government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The Contracting Officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the Contracting Officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p>J. Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation: As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, "Post-Award Small Business Program Re-representation (Apr 2012)," is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.

The clause provides detail on when the re-representation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a re-representation is required.</p>
<p>K. Employment Eligibility Verification: As prescribed by FAR 22.1803, FAR Clause 52.222-54, Employment Eligibility Verification (Jul 2012), is hereby incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Any contract awarded as a result of this BAA that is above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, and contains a period of performance greater than 120 days, shall include this clause. This clause provides the requirement of contractors to enroll as a Federal Contractor in the E-Verify program within 30 days after contract award.</p>
<p>L. Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Sub-contract/Sub-recipient Awards: As prescribed by FAR 4.1403(a), FAR 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (Aug 2012) is hereby incorporated by reference in this solicitation.

<DESC><p>Reference Solicitation 12-01-RQKD posted 10/2012 in FedBizOps.</p>
<p>The objective is to establish a consortium not a manufacturing project. The objective of the NBMC is to accelerate risk assessment and the development of robust mitigation approaches for critical nano-bio materials and fabrication innovations by developing common technology and manufacturing platforms through public-private partnerships between federal laboratories, DoD acquisition centers, academia, US manufacturing enterprises, and commercial industries. To achieve this objective, the institute is envisioned to create a community of large and small companies, academia, federal laboratories, and the states to accelerate innovation by investing in industrially-relevant nano-bio manufacturing technologies. Ultimately, a fully functioning NBMC will have both virtual and physical entities that will enable partners to bridge the gap between basic research and product transition by developing verified and validated open architecture processing-design-performance, forecasting, and risk assessment tools for integration of new nano-bio materials and process technologies. Additionally, it will provide shared assets to help companies' access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment, and create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills. A successful consortium will serve as a technical center of excellence, providing the infrastructure to support manufacturing enterprises at a prototype level that are relevant and scalable; and ensuring that the key capabilities for DoD needs is available.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Applied Best Practices &amp; Coordination Team's Learning &amp; Training Unit (ABC/LTU) aims to build the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve both country program performance as well as their own professional performance.</p>
<p>The Learning and Training Unit (LTU) supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills, and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve both country program performance as well as their own professional development. The LTU does this by: designing and providing innovative learning solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced, global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services, referrals and administrative assistance that permits OTI's primarily USPSC staff to benefit from other USAID and external training opportunities.</p>
<p>The LTU coordinates closely with ABC's two other units that are focused on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E), and on Innovation through the application of technology-including OTI's new knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools-to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance.  The LTU will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. The LTI will coordinate closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>OTI's Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist position provides support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned.  The Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist will be supervised by the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Team Leader of the Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist will support OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players working in rapidly changing environments to have the information and training they need to support and start up new programs, work with beneficiaries, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  This position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.  The Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist will lead the ABC team's Learning and Training Unit (LTU), under OTI's Program, Learning, and Innovation (PLI) division.  The Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist will ensure OTI's learning and training efforts are field-focused, effective, integrated, and accessible and coordinated with other USAID learning and training opportunities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To provide direct support in political transition program implementation under OTI's Program, Learning and Innovation division.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Learning Specialist/Senior Learning Specialist is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	Assist with OTI's training development budget, in close coordination with supervisor, the ABC Team Leader and Transition Specialist and/or Program Manager.

<p>&bull;	Serve on inter- and intra-agency working groups on learning and training on transitional assistance and/or working in complex, crisis and transitional environments if/when required.</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with all parts of OTI.

<p>&bull;	Assist in implementation of a proposed means of monitoring and evaluating the learning and training efforts, including generating feedback that will help shape future learning and training.</p>
<p>&bull;	With the ABC Learning Training Unit Administrative Program Assistant, track all employee required and completed trainings.  Collaborate with OTI/OMD's Human Resources and Administrative Support (HR/A) team during the new or transitioning employee onboarding process to ensure smooth handover.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR<br />LOW METALLIC SIGNATURE MINE DETECTOR
<p><br />The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Combat Support Systems (PM CSS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources and industry capabilities to design, develop, test, manufacture and deliver the next generation handheld explosives hazard detection system, the Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMS MD).</p>
<p>1. Description: The LMS MD will be the material solution to the capability gap that currently exists in the detection of explosive devices. It is a light-weight, man-portable, handheld detection system that is capable of detecting traditional, low-metallic and non-metallic mines and explosive devices. It will enable the mobility of dismounted forces by significantly increasing their ability to locate, mark, avoid, and/or reduce explosive threats. Additionally, it will enhance explosives threat identification and categorization by discriminating between detected mines and improvised explosive devices that contain little to no metallic content, to include unexploded ordnance. As a system to be used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technicians, the discriminating capability of the LMS MD will enable the neutralization and exploitation of explosive devises with little metallic content, to include their initiating systems.</p>
<p>2. Specification: The following performance and functional characteristics represent the minimum threshold and objective level capabilities of the LMS MD.<br />a. Detection. The LMS MD shall be capable of detecting metallic, low metallic and non-metallic symmetric and asymmetric threats in dry and wet environments in loam, sand, clay and river rock test substrates containing indigenous vegetation, and in close proximity to operational vehicles. Note: Loam is defined as a combination of 40% silt, 40% sand and 20% clay. The threshold (T) probability of detection [P(d)] is 85% for baseline targets, while the objective (O) is 95% P(d) for less metallic or deeper buried threats.<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for low metallic explosive hazards (EH) with 0.09 oz. (2.5 grams) of mild steel or aluminum and low metallic asymmetric components at a depth of 4 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for high metallic EHs with 3.5 oz. (100 grams) of mild steel or aluminum at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for buried non-metallic components with a 24 square inch (sq. in.) horizontal surface area (with 3in. cross section) (T) and a 95% P(d) for a buried non-metallic component with a circular surface area equal to or less than 7 sq. in. (3in. diameter). <br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for non-metallic components with a 100 sq. in. horizontal surface area (with a 3 inch cross section) at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />b. Endurance. The LMS MD shall be capable of 8 (T) and 16.5 (O) hours of continuous active sweeping operation in climatic conditions with temperatures from -25&deg;F to +120&deg;F without degradation of system performance and/or power source recharge or replacement. The LMS MD shall use batteries that have been approved by DoD for shipboard storage/use, and aircraft transport (T), or batteries currently available within the DoD supply system (O).<br />Where applicable the LMS MD battery shall be rechargeable using 100-240VAC (50Hz-60Hz) and 11-36VDC power sources. <br />Where applicable, the LMS MD shall operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or a standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s). The LMS MD shall have an auxiliary power source adapter that can operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s).<br />c. False Alarm Rates (FAR). The false alarm rate (FAR) is defined as the percentage of total detections where the detector alerts the operator when no underground object is present. The FAR associated with symmetric and asymmetric targets differ due to their inherit designs. The methodology for measurement is defined as the number of false alarms per 25 square meters.</p>
<p>Symmetric targets are items manufactured and characterized by fixed and known design standards and specification. Accordingly, symmetric targets with these fixed and known characteristics (sizes, shapes, functionalities, metallic signatures, etc.) tend to be more exploitable/detectable then ad hoc asymmetric designed targets. Symmetric targets are typically of an all-inclusive designed device (firing mechanism, detonator, and main explosive charge) common to military ordnance items (mines, grenades, projectiles etc.). The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 5 percent (T) and 3 percent (O) for symmetric targets.<br />Asymmetric threats or improvised explosive devices (IED) have no standard exploitable design characteristics. No design is exactly the same and quite often crudely assembled from separate components (main charge, initiation device, detonator, power supply, and circuitry) into a randomly designed explosive hazard. The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 10 percent (T) and 5 percent (O) for asymmetric targets.</p>
<p>d. The LMS MD shall have an "instant-on" start-up time of less than 90 seconds (T) and 60 seconds (O) from its pack stowed condition, to set-up and be ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation. The start-up time is defined as the time when the LMS MD is powered ON to the time it is ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation.</p>
<p>e. Operational Weight. In its operational configuration, the LMS MD shall weigh less than 9.0 lbs (T) and less than 5.0 lbs (O). When configured for operation, the system will include the wand, search head, external control unit, battery and headset, but not the carrying case, calibration equipment, spare power supplies or optional equipment.</p>
<p>f. Modular Design. The LMS MD shall have a modular design that allows for components to be interchangeable between detectors (T) and does not require recalibration afterward (O). <br />3. The Government is interested in receiving your insight on the aforementioned proposed acquisition. Interested sources that possess the technical capability and resources to fulfill the Government's requirements stated herein are invited to provide a Letter of Interest and a Capability Statement. Responses should include at a minimum:<br />a. Product literature, including a description of the system and validating information in the form of independent or government conducted testing supporting claims that the proposed system meets the system performance specification. If the system cannot meet one or more of the thresholds contained in this synopsis, explain the best capability of the system in that area. Include information of any capabilities or optional capabilities above and beyond the specification contained in this notification.<br />b. Pricing Information<br />c. Production and delivery capability<br />d. Capability to provide parts and repair support<br />e. Past performance information detailing any experience with hand-held mine detection systems in general and ground penetrating radar in particular<br />Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed more than (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Reponses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New.<br />Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector Response to Request for Information".<br />This sources-sought/Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.</p>

Dollar Value</strong>:<br /><br /><strong>Department of the Army<br />Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity - Brand Name<br />Order Under ADMC-2<br />CHESS Multiple Award Schedule<br /></strong><br />1.&nbsp; <strong>Contracting Activity:</strong>&nbsp; U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island, IL&nbsp; 61299-8000.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; <strong>Description of Contract Action:</strong>&nbsp; This action requests approval of a Brand Name Justification for the purchase of quantity 21 Panasonic tablets (12 each H2 tablet and 9 each U1 tablet) to be tested by and fielded to the users at Virginia National Guard and the Ft Lee DOL.&nbsp; The required date is 30 days ARO.&nbsp; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds have been provided to support this action.&nbsp; A firm-fixed-price delivery order is anticipated.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; <strong>Description of Supplies/Services:&nbsp; </strong>The estimated value of the proposed action is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; The panasonic H2 and U1 tablets are required as part of the Lead Site Verification Test at Ft Lee DOL and the Virginia National Guard.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; <strong>Authority Cited:&nbsp; </strong>Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Pub. L. 107-107), DFARs 216-505-70(b) and 8.405-6(b)(1).&nbsp; The supplies or services to be ordered are unique or highly specialized by brand name.&nbsp; However, more than one vendor under the ADMC-2 contract is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required.&nbsp; Thus, competition will be restricted to vendors with an AMDC-2 contract that can quote Panasonic products.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; <strong>Rationale for Limiting Sources:&nbsp;</strong> Hundreds of hours have been dedicated to complete Lead Site Validation Test (LSVT) test cases to support a device that will evaluate the critical Mission Task associated with the GCSS-Army software solution.&nbsp; This requirement is a follow-on action for hardware that was ordered under contract W91QUZ-06-D-0003,DO BA95 by ACC-RI.&nbsp; The requirement was not&nbsp;completely fulfilled to complete the original test case.&nbsp; Therefore, additional tablets are required to support the completion of testing.&nbsp; The purpose of this test case is to investigate whether this configuration of equipment will satisfy the technical requirements or if a configuration consisting of higher capabilities will be required.&nbsp; If this brand-name specific equipment is not procured, the Army Test and Evaluation Command, who performs the independent assessment, would not be able to complete this test case task and consequently, the mission would fail.&nbsp;&nbsp; This specific hardware is currently being tested at 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) at Ft. Irwin and there is not enough data for the test case being produced.&nbsp; Consequently, in accordance with the Department of Army G4 SES, we are being directed to provide additional testing at the Ft. Lee Directorate of Logistics (DOL) and the Virginia Army National Guard.&nbsp; If a different platform other than the Panasonic that was tested in the LSVT was utilized for the additional test case, requiring the developers to configure a new test case. the Government would incur a substantial and unacceptable time delay causing Congress to shut down this program.&nbsp; The Government would also experience a significant cost increase that would exceed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on impact and place the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; program at risk of shut-down with the office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).&nbsp; Utilizing other than these Panasonic tablets would prevent the Government from receiving a successful evaluation report and the Government would not be able to move forward with the fielding of this Acquisition Category I MAIS (ACAT IAM) program as directed by the OSD.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; <strong>Market Research:</strong>&nbsp; Market research will continue to be conducted to determine if changes occur in the marketplace that would enable competition for further actions, but at this time, the Panasonic is the only device that can run the Army Golden Master, will meet the IAVA requirements for the GCSS-Army SAP solution, and perform the IUID and AIT requirements as mandated by the Department of Defense.&nbsp; The Contract Specialist at ACC-RI confirmed that the required equipment is available on both the ADMC-2 CHESS contract and GSA schedules.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; <strong>Actions to Increase Competition:&nbsp;</strong> At this time, the assessment that will be performed on the tablets, once fielded, will determine the future procurements and competition that will be performed.&nbsp; If these specific tablets pass the test case,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />8.&nbsp; <strong>Other Facts:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Contract was originally awarded under W91QUZ-06-D-0003, DO BA95 by ACC-RI, however, the requirements authorized to the units was not fulfilled.&nbsp; This order will complete the requirement for the LSVT and allow Army Test and Evaluation Command performs the independent assessment as required.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; <strong>Technical Certification:<br /><br /></strong>I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this limited source justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br /><br /><br />10.&nbsp;<strong> Requirements Certification:<br /><br /></strong>I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this limited source justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.&nbsp; After reviewing the requirement, and the Office of Management and Budget's July 29, 2009 letter, I hereby certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that there are no alternatives available other than an order limiting competition by brand name to fulfill this requirement.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; <strong>Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination</strong>:&nbsp; I hereby determine that the anticipated cost or price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.<br /><br />Typed Name:&nbsp; Jeffrey S.
