<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to procure  approximately 31,000 native shrubs (e.g., 10 cubic inch native shrub seedlings) for the Hanford Reach National Monument in Richland Washington. This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on providing documentation that the seed source is from the area identified in the scope of work and price. Documentation of seed source is significantly more important than price. Statement of work for these native shrub is as follows: The Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge lies in the Columbia Basin Ecoregion of Eastern Washington State.  This ecoregion is in the "rain shadow" of the Cascade Mountains and is the hottest and driest part of the State.  Rainfall values for the area average 6" annually.  Temperatures often exceed 90o F during the summer, while winter temperatures hover near freezing, and can reach as low as -23o F.  Windy, drying conditions are normal for the region.  Soils are alluvial deposits from ice age lakes, and river channels.  Soils tend to be sandy, with little organic material, and do not generally retain significant moisture.  Due to these conditions, plant materials adapted to the site conditions are essential for restoration purposes.  Plant materials derived from the local ecoregion will have a competitive advantage during establishment and have a higher probability of survival once established, than material that is not from the local ecoregion. Plant Materials: o	Seed source for growing plant material should be Hanford or Columbia Basin Ecoregion derived.  The Columbia Basin Ecoregion is defined as that area of land and associated plant communities that lie in and around the Columbia River basin of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  Seeds that produced plant materials must have their origin in this area.  Unless otherwise cleared through the staff of the Monument. o	Shrubs may be grown as bareroot stock in nursery beds, or as container stock in 10" tublings. o	Plants must be a minimum age of 5 months old. o	Bare root stock should be a minimum of 15 cm height, with a minimum root length of 15 cm, with a maximum root length of 30 cm o	Container stock roots should completely fill the containers o	Plants should be grown in a soil medium that is inoculated with soil mycorrhizal fungi for root colonization. o	Plants should be cold hardened for dormancy prior to delivery. 	The FOB is Benton County, Washington, at the U.S.F.W.S. office 3250 Port of Benton Blvd. Richland, Washington,99354.  The approximate expected Delivery date is between 26 November and 10 December, 2007. 	* Return of any containers/shipping cartons must be specified in bid with cost of return to be born by successful bidder.

<SUBJECT>A -- Pilot Project to Estimate the Incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection Among Young Injection Drug Users (IDUs) Using serial Cross-Sectional Seroprevalence Surveys
<SOLNBR>2007-N-09566

<CONTACT>Catherine Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 4046398887, Fax 4044988095, Email chj5@cdc.gov - Betty Vannoy, Contract Specialist, Phone 4046398293, Fax 4046398095, Email bbv9@cdc.gov
<DESC>Currently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors the national incidence of acute hepatitis C through passive surveillance of acute, symptomatic cases of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C.  (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/resource/surveillance.htm#DisSpecAcuteC).  This case definition requires that case-patients have laboratory markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in addition to evidence of an acute illness with a discrete onset of symptoms or jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes.  However, only a minority of people with acute infection have symptoms at all (<25%) and although the case definition is highly specific, it only captures a small fraction of acutely infected people, i.e., those who have symptoms and receive medical attention and appropriate laboratory testing during the acute phase of the disease.  Injection drug users (IDUs), who are the primary risk group for acute hepatitis C (70% of identified acute cases), have additional barriers to health care access and/or utilization resulting in the potential for a further underestimation of overall incidence.  Thus, it is necessary to consider strategies other than passive surveillance for incidence monitoring.

CDC has a requirement to contract services for a pilot project to estimate the incidence of hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection among young injection drug users (IDUs) using serial cross-sectional Seroprevalence Surveys (SCSSs).  The solicitation will be for multi-award contracts to develop and test different methods to recruit a sample of young IDUs that is representative of the population of young IDUs at risk for HCV infection in a defined geographic area.  These sampling methods will be compared and contrasted to identify a methodology to be used in ongoing SCSSs among young IDUs.  In addition, instruments for collecting behavioral/risk factor data from IDUs will be developed and pilot tested.  

This is a full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract in accordance with FAR 15 is contemplated.  There will be two phases for this contract; Phase I  will be 1 to 8 months and Phase 2 will be 9 to 24 months, total period of performance is 24 months.  

CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number 2007-N-09566 will be available on or about June 8, 2007.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 45 days after posting of the RFP.  All questions/concerns pertaining to the RFP shall be submitted via email chj5@cdc.gov.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at fedbizopps website for downloading.  Telephone requests and facsimile transmissions will be not be honored.

<DESC>The Advanced Technology Institute (ATI), in support of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) for the Seabasing Future Naval Capability (FNC), intends to solicit technology capable of automating the processing and handling necessary to ready both All-Up-Round (AUR) and component based weapons employed from sea-based fixed wing aircraft.  This pre-solicitation notice has been posted to promote industry awareness and to provide a draft solicitation for industry feedback prior to and during the scheduled Industry Day discussed below.  The goal of the draft solicitation release is to generate a reasonable final solicitation with clearly stated performance specifications and design requirements.  

Phase 1 of this effort will be for the Concept Development Phase of the Science and Technology (S&T) development of a core technology or suite of complimentary technologies which, when combined with other mechanical/electronic features, automates weapons assembly processes.  The amount of automation will provide the proper man-to-machine balance necessary to produce the desired ready service weapons output; while taking into consideration the necessary safety, ship integration, system reliability, and cost concerns.  The automation focus is on substantially reducing human requirements, reducing weapons production times, minimizing process footprint, and enhancing safety.  

Multiple proposals may be funded for this Phase I effort.  The funding for Phase I of the project is limited to a maximum of $750,000.00 for each awardee.  The period of performance for Phase I is eight (8) months from award date, which is anticipated to be in October 2007.  The complete project (Phase I and follow-on) inclusive of options is anticipated to be 60 months or less in length.

The Contracting Officer has determined the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this procurement to be 541710.

An Industry Day is scheduled to occur Monday, 11 June 2007 from 1:00 to 5:00 PM at the ATI Offices located at Trident Research Center, 5300 International Blvd, Charleston, SC.   The Industry Day provides an opportunity for ATI to present the draft performance specifications, answer questions, and document relevant feedback for potential incorporation into the final RFP.  Industry teaming is strongly encouraged and time will be provided for teaming discussions.

All interested technology providers/vendors are invited to participate in the Industry Day on a purely voluntary basis.  ATI will not provide reimbursement for any cost associated with Industry Day attendance.  Due to the restrictive nature of weapons assembly information, participation is limited to US-owned companies only.  Interested parties should provide attendee information to Michael Atkinson at atkinson@aticorp.org no later than Thursday, 7 June 2007.

A draft version of the solicitation document is attached.  Attendees are also encouraged to submit written comments in advance to Michael Atkinson at atkinson@aticorp.org to facilitate efficient use of the allotted discussion time.

The final Solicitation document is scheduled to be issued on or about 18 June 2007.

Base support shall be provided by the Government to the Contractor in accordance with this clause. Failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause shall release the Government, without prejudice, from its obligation to provide base support by the date(s) required. If warranted, and if the Contractor has complied with the requirements of this clause, an equitable adjustment shall be made if the Government fails to provide base support by the date(s) required. 
(a) Base support includes Government-controlled working space, material, equipment, services (including automatic data processing), or other support (excluding use of the Defense Switched Network (DSN)) which the Government determines can be made available at, or through, any Air Force installation where this contract shall be performed. All Government property in the possession of the Contractor, provided through the base support clause, shall be used and managed in accordance with the Government Property clauses. 

(b) The Air Force installations providing the support shall be listed in subparagraph (e), and the Government support to be furnished by each installation under this contract shall be listed in subparagraph (f) 

(c) Unless otherwise stipulated in the contract schedule, support shall be provided on a 
no-charge-for-use basis and the value shall be a part of the Government's contract consideration. 

(d) The Contractor agrees to immediately report (with a copy to 
the cognizant CAO) inadequacies, defective Government-Furnished Property (GFP), or nonavailability of support stipulated by the contract schedule, together with a recommended plan for obtaining the required support. The Government agrees to determine (within 10 workdays) the validity and extent of the involved requirement and the method by which it shall be fulfilled (e.g., purchase, rental, lease, GFP, etc.). Facilities shall not be purchased under this clause. Additionally, the Contractor (or authorized representative) shall not purchase, or otherwise furnish any base support requirement provided by the clause (or authorize others to do so), without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer regarding the price, terms, and conditions of the proposed purchase, or approval of other arrangements. 

(e) Following are installations where base support will be provided: Air Force Research Laboratory at Rome Research Site. 

(f) The Government support to be furnished under this contract 
are support services for the photonics processing branch to include research, development, test, evaluation and limited acquisition of techniques, capabilities and systems for surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, reliability, compatibility, command and control, electromagnetics, solid state sciences, and photonics as stated in the Statement of Work. Because of the nature and location(s) of the work performed, the value of such equipment is undeterminable. The Contractor shall not incur any cost resulting from nonsupport prior to Contracting Officer concurrence in accordance with this clause.

(g) When this contract is a cost, cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, or labor hour contract, the Contractor agrees that in the performance of this contract or any major subcontract no direct or indirect costs for property will be incurred if the Government determines that property is available at, or through any Air Force installation where this contract shall be performed. Only the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer can relieve the Contractor from this restriction.
Note that the clause at 252.232-7003 is included in this solicitation.  DoD requires all payment requests (with a few exceptions) to be submitted and processed electronically.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Johns Hopkins University, Core SNP Center, 600 N. Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD  21224.   The contractor will replicate our findings of gene-personality relations, it is of great interest to analyze a set of the top findings in Sardinia for each personality trait in the Baltimore ECA populations study that has been conducted since 1980 by Professor William Easton and colleagues at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health.  NEO-PI-r personality data on 720 individuals who gave consent for blood draws and DNA extraction and genetic analyses will be performed under this sole source contract with the SNP Center Health, JHU.  This procurement will allow for the genotyping of 720 unique samples with two platforms of 1,536 SNPs each.  The first batch will be delivered in October 2007.  The second batch will be delivered in January 2008.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement, 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Johns Hopkins University is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.   The Baltimore DCA sample and associated DNA are a tremendously unique and invaluable data set and source. Only this sample has carefully followed a community sample since 1980 and has collected NEO-PI-R personality information as well as personality disorder, life chart, health, and service use data on a multiracial inner-city sample.  In addition, and most importantly, the Institutional Review Board or IRB requirements (H.33.01.03.26-A2) stipulates and requires the ECA DNA to be reposited at the JHU Core.  Thus the only genotyping facility that is granted access to the DNA and that can perform these genotyping assays is the DNP Core Center.  The period of performance is 12 months.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

The National Customs Service of Chile is a semi-autonomous public agency with overall responsibility for the administration of import procedures and the collection of all revenues related to foreign trade, including value-added taxes and specific taxes. 

As part of the implementation of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (U.S.-Chile FTA), the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is funding Technical Assistance on the implementation of Article 5.10(1)(b) of U.S.-Chile FTA, which requires both parties to issue written advance rulings prior to the importation of a good in response to a request from an importer or exporter regarding the application of customs valuation criteria for a particular case, in accordance with the application of provisions set forth in the Customs Valuation Agreement.  

The Technical Assistance will involve developing a draft regulation on advance rulings; establishing new procedures; developing and delivering training for Chilean Customs officers; providing tools, such as a training manual, to assist the National Customs Service with the implementation of an ongoing training program; and helping design advance rulings and valuation databases, which Customs officers can use to facilitate the processing of advance rulings and the application of customs valuation.

-Review existing legislation and prepare a draft regulation for advance rulings
-Develop procedures for the application of advance rulings on customs valuation
-Design a valuation database and advance rulings database
-Develop and deliver a training program on advance rulings and valuation criteria for the -National Customs Service to be held in Chile and the United States
-Prepare a Final Report

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences proposes to contract on a "Sole Source" basis (pursuant to FAR 6.302-1) with Health Research and Analysis (HRA) for technical support on the on-going "Cancer in the Military" research project. Our study requires the extraction of data from the Military Data Repository, a database composed of both administrative and clinical data.  HRA?s personnel have the appropriate ADP clearance level to access this database, as well the experience accessing data from administrative and clinical databases.  HRA is very familiar with our protocol and the data, has received specialized training in extracting data from the Military Data Repository and has shown the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform the data extraction and descriptive analysis.  The integrity of scientific research hinges on continuity.  As the incumbent HRA is uniquely suited to continue the effort without introducing any variation to established protocols, which would severely compromise our research study as well as delay further extraction and analysis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael Jackson, HQAMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5022, 618-229-0267, Fax 618-256-6668, email:  michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>Status on CFT source selection as of 22 May 2007.  The meeting between OUSD/DPAP and OUSD/AT&L is still anticipated to occur 24 May 2007.  This date is always subject to change and is not cast in concrete.  The source selection team is still involved with working the myriad of documents required to be reviewed and signed by SAF/AQ prior to release of the formal RFP.  As of 22 May 2007, it appears a 4 Jun 2007 release date is unlikely.  No major obstacles have been encountered, just the normal delays in getting things reviewed.  No "best guess" date is available at this time, however, the team does not expect an RFP to be released before 25 June 2007.  Updates will be posted as they become available.

The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces.

<CONTACT>Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Phone 304-285-5880, Fax 304-285-6083, Email rmullenax@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division and the Exposure Assessment Branch  intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Research Triangle Institute (RTI), 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research, NC 27709-2194 for preparing test slides for an ASTM International Inter-Laboratory Study to study the precision of asbestos counting rules in ASTM Standard D7200.  RTI has already taken non asbestos amphibole minerals and subjected them to communition by hydraulic press, sieving, and ball milling to achieve target fiber sizes defined by CDC/NIOSH.  RTI will do the same with five NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) asbestos reference materials. RTI will then combine these materials on filters and prepare test slides for the ILS. The test materials will be characterized by RTI using phase contrast microscopy (PCM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as specified and a report will be provided.

This is necessary in order to protect workers against asbestos and other regulated fibers, measurements are made of airborne fibers. These measurements are used in risk analysis and in setting control requirements. Potentially life-saving or expensive decisions should only be made on the basis of accurate exposure assessments. Continuous improvements to the sampling, analytical, and quality assurance aspects of fiber-counting are necessary.   In mining, asbestos fibers may be present alongside cleavage fragments of non-asbestiform amphiboles.  An ASTM Standard procedure has been developed to separately identify mineral cleavage fragments from other, potentially asbestiform, fibers in air samples. The methodology in the Standard must be checked by a round-robin test to determine the efficiency of the separation method. A supply of known non-asbestiform amphibole cleavage fragments of appropriate dimensions is required to prepare the test material.   The project objective is to improve the analysis of fibers, including asbestos, thereby contributing to more accurate hygienic decisions, and better allocation of resources.   The scope of work includes a base year and one option year. 

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Rebecca Mullenax, Reference 000HCCCD-2007-42984,  DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail rmullenax@cdc.gov  or fax to 304-285-6083.   

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov. 

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide answers/questions and is provided as amendment 0001 to the Synopsis (W9124R-07-R-0013). 1. Are there any restricted or reserved RF frequencies being utilized that would limit the frequency selection of the potential vendor?  A: All wireless communication links must operate in compliance with Federal radio bands.  This requires obtaining a JF-12 number processed on Department of Defense form DD 1494, Application for Spectrum Review. System compliance with Federal radio bands is  the sole responsibility of the contractor, as stated on sections 1.2.2, 1.3.6 and 3.1.4 of this statement of work. 2. What is the size and shape of the typical volumetric impact field? (x, y, z) A: 3.1       The contractor shall meet or exceed the following requirements/tasks: 3.1.1	Performance/Accuracy The system shall operate on the following:    Volumetric impact fields, along line of projectiles' flight, that range from minimum .1km in width X .1km in length X 1.6km in height to maximum 1.6km in width X 6.4km in length X 1.6km in height.   Surface impact fields, along line of projectiles' flight, that range from minimum 0.1km square to maximum 1.6km x 6.4km rectangle.    3.	What environmental issues would place limitations to access for installing system components in or around a typical volumetric impact field by surface transport? (i.e. presence of live ordinance; un-navigable terrain, security requirements, etc.) A: Refer to section 3.1.2 for environmental requirement.  Also, the presence of unaccounted live ordinance on the surface or below the surface of impact fields is real and will restrict the use of 100% mechanized surface transportation in some areas.  3.1.2 	   Environmental Performance. Testing areas are located in desert, (Yuma Test Center YTC at YPG), arctic (Cold Regions Test Center, CRTC, Ft Greely Alaska ) and tropical areas(Tropic Test Center, TTC).   These testing areas have limited roads, no roads nor improvements and include surface conditions of almost any type, sand, snow, shallow water and gravel.   Systems shall be capable of emplacement and transport in these environments.   Systems shall be capable of day and night operation during clear, rain, and snow conditions.   Field units shall be rugged and capable of operating in desert (50C, full sunshine, low and high humidity, and rain), arctic (-40C, rain and snow), tropic (rain & high humidity) conditions.   Electronics shall be sealed against dust, water, rain, and insect/rodent intrusion.   Units must be operational in winds for 1 to 10 m/s and capable of withstanding higher winds without damage. Sensor systems placed on/near impact fields shall withstand the blast wave from nearby explosive events, (41 kpa (7 psi) which is produced by 1 pound of high explosives (HE) at 10 feet, or higher amounts at greater distances). System shall continue to operate normally during lesser nearby explosive events (with the transmitted acoustic signal level at its upper limit). Base units (recording, acquisition, computer display, etc) shall be located in an Instrumentation Shelter.  The instrumentation shelter is provided by the Government.  However, that shelter is exposed to high intensity impulse noise (7kpa, 1psi) from gunfire or explosions.   These units shall be capable of withstanding shock.  Units shall be capable of operating without interruption during these shocks.  4.	What is the operational concept for the use of this system: single installation and continuous use/on-off use; redeploy and energize as needed? A:  Redeploy and energize as in 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.1.4: 3.1.2 	   Environmental Performance.   3.1.3	Operational Power and Time.    All field units shall be capable of 48-hour continuous operation plus a 4-day standby period.   48-hour operational and 2 week standby desired.  Acoustic and other Sensor Units emplaced on/near impact field shall be self -powered.  Batteries preferred.   Batteries used shall be standard commercially available and easily replaced.   Solar power to supplement/charge batteries is acceptable subject to the nearby explosive event survival requirement for those on impact field. Other Field Units (e.g... meteorological, wireless relays) not on impact field can use batteries or low noise generators.   Definition of low noise will depend on the distance from the acoustic sensors to where these units will be emplaced. Base units (located in instrumentation shelter) shall operate on Government supplied Generator power and fixed electrical power (120 Volt, 60 Hz). 3.1.4 	Wireless System Operation.   Wireless communications links shall have a minimum range of 20 Km.  This does not preclude the use of wireless concentrator/relay to meet the 20 km requirement.   Field subsystem shall transmit subsystem status data over the wireless link to the user interface for all devices running on them.   The status data will vary with the subsystem but shall include such things as battery status, wireless link radio frequency (RF) level, and self check items associated with the local devices (acoustic, meteorological, and timing).     5.	Are there preferred structures for mounting acoustic sensors? A: 3.1.7	System Packaging.   System instrumentation located at base control shall mount on standard 19 inch instrumentation rack (computers, hardware and displays).   Acoustic Sensors shall be Portable, either by a maximum two-man carry or wheeled by one-man.   Folding/Collapsing to minimize volume in storage and transit is desired.   Instrumentation and subsystems which are not portable shall have some provision for transport (e.g. trailer).  Also, preferably acoustic sensors shall be off-ground. 6.	What resources are anticipated for installation/redeployment of field sensors? A:  See 3.1.7 above for acoustic sensor portability.  Mechanized transport depends on environment (desert, tropic, artic). Refer to section 3.1.2 for environmental requirement.  Also, the presence of unaccounted live ordinance on the surface or below the surface of impact fields is real and will restrict the use of 100% mechanized surface transportation in some areas.     7.	The system is expected to operate for a minimum of 48 hours nonstop. What is the expectation of the overall battery life ( number of active 48 hour increments plus non-active interim periods)  for battery operated components?  A:  See 3.1.3 and 3.1.5: 3.1.5 Data Acquisition and Recording.  The system shall have anti-aliasing data acquisition hardware/software to digitize and save raw acoustic data for a minimum of 48 hours nonstop sampled at a minimum of 50 KHz for each acoustic sensor module included in the array configuration (appropriate rates and data intervals for other sensors).  During this time, the system shall process data and display results, plots and statistics, on multiple remote monitors while continuing to collect real-time data.  At the end of each acquisition, the system shall store the data in a secure file format to prevent overwrites and to make files available for post acquisition analysis.   A fault tolerant hardware controller RAID array system is preferred for local data archiving. 8.	The system is expected to operate during bright and obscure light conditions. What is the expected duration of obscure light conditions and interim periods of bright light conditions between obscure light conditions? A:  See answers to question 7.  There is obvious day and night light conditions within the 48 hours nonstop period, plus there will be unexpected natural conditions like extreme bright sunshine, heavy clouds and dust during the day.  1.3.2     The system must serve users in numerous geographic locations, during all light conditions, in all environments and all weather conditions.   9.	What GIS data is available for terrain mapping of th e typical volumetric impact fields? A:  The following GIS data is in use at YPG for Government purposes and entities only.

<DESC>There is no relationship between the USAR Command Enterprise Managed Network Services acquisition and the Army Reserve Data Center acquisition.  They are completely separate acquisitions.  There will be required interfaces between the contractor awar ded the Network Managed Services contract and the Data Center contract due to the closely integrated nature of the USAR IT operations.  There are similar devices in the Data Center as well as the network.  Both the Data Center and the network have firewall s and load balancers.  It is anticipated the Data Center contract may manage the devices located within the confines of the Data Center; the Network Managed Services contract may manage those device located on the WAN.

<DESC>Modification 0001 for Synopsis WC133W-07-RQ-0237
Two New 10-Ton Computer Room Air Conditioning Units for Philadelphia WFO, Mt. Holly, New Jersey.
 

The Brand Name Justification is as follows:

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisitions Regulation 6.302-1 (c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by Executive Order (EO 13423) to maintain, monitor, log and control temperature and humidity in our facilities.   Also, as a Government agency, the NWS is under increased scrutiny and initiative to lower electrical costs of operations.   The American Power Conversion (APC), Precision/Packaged Air Conditioning (PAC) Units offers several features which increase reliability, efficiency, lower maintenance, and manageability.  

A Pre-solicitation research conducted by the contract specialist confirms the validity of the customers request for the American Power Conversion (APC), Precision/Packaged Air Conditioning (PAC) Units branded requirement.  In addition, the Contracting Officer concurs with the customers argument that a product other than the one specified would be costly, less efficient and harder to maintain.

<ARCHDATE>05212008
<CONTACT>Debra Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     debra.bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a cost reimbursement-type contract for the effort described below.  Please read this entire notice carefully.  The anticipated period of performance shall be no more than 18 months from the effective date of the contract.  The estimated cost range is between $300,000 and $350,000.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project will address oil and gas leasing policies that affect the pace of leasing, exploration, and production and the size of Federal revenues in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico.  Federal revenue includes lease bonuses, rentals, and royalties collected by the MMS.  The contractor will: (a) examine current leasing policies, define alternative policies, and contrast their effects on the pace of leasing, exploration, and production activities and the size of Federal revenues; (b) determine if any alternative policies are more likely than the status quo to promote the multiple goals of the leasing program as enumerated in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act (43 USC Sec. 1801 and 1802).  Analysis will address concerns raised in public comment on environmental and lease sale documents, including current leasing policies might not raise enough Federal revenue, might detract from coastal State efforts to raise revenue in their leasing programs, and might lead to excessive environmental impacts on coastal States.  Elements of alternative policies include: setting limited sale size by nomination or selection approaches instead of areawide; reducing the acreage offered in each sale; breaking up Central and Western Gulf of Mexico areas; altering the frequency of sales; raising minimum bid; changing initial lease period; raising rental rates; raising royalty rates; changing the auction bidding variable or payment scheme (e.g., net profit share).  The work is anticipated to be divided into four tasks.  Task 1, the purposes for the analysis and the quantitative performance criteria by which alternative policies are to be contrasted will be developed.  Task 2, empirical analysis and modeling will be done to contrast the baseline and alternative scenarios quantitatively in terms of the performance criteria. The contractor will choose the methodology for empirical analysis.  The method may use simulation and forecasting methods; econometric methods may be used as well if statistical results are likely to be meaningful given limitations on data.  Task 3, one or more field tests of alternative policies will be designed; that is, a design for a lease sale(s) implementing one or more non-status quo policies according to an experimental design to test hypotheses about performance of alternative policies.  The task covers only test design; actually conducting any field testing is not included.  Task 4 is to prepare a report.  The work will require meeting with MMS staff in Herndon, VA, and New Orleans, LA.  SOURCES SOUGHT:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: (a) your past performance, including ability to complete projects with high quality on time and control costs; and (b) the scientific and technical persons you will have working on the project, explaining the parts of the project they will work on and their areas of expertise.  Offerors shall provide specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel is currently performing or has completed within the last three (3) years.  Capabilities of any subcontractors or partners will also be considered.  EVALUATION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENT: Your capabilities statement will be evaluated on the basis of these criteria:  (A) Past Performance -- ability to complete products of high quality and adhere to schedules and budgets; whether past projects worked on are comparable to this contract project, including complexity and size; and how well your organization and the key personnel who will work on this project cooperated with past clients.  (B) Scientific and Technical Personnel --  Relating to Task 1, knowledge of the Federal offshore leasing program and expertise useful in formulating specific policies and quantitative performance criteria are relevant.  For Task 2, particularly relevant is expertise in: collecting and managing data for statistical analysis; simulation modeling, econometrics, and forecasting; and analysis of fiscal systems for leasing.  For Task 3, particularly relevant is expertise in experimental economics using field testing.  RESPONSE DUE DATE AND SUBMISSION:  One original and four (4) copies of the capability statement shall be sent to the Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS 2101, Herndon, VA  20170-4817, Attn: Debra Bridge, by Close of Business Wednesday, June 20, 2007.  Any questions regarding this procurement shall be e-mailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov no later than May 31, 2007.  Please include with your questions your full name, RFP Number 13306, & Title "Policies to Affect the Pace of Leasing and Revenues in the Gulf of Mexico."  Also include your organization's name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.  Any submissions received after the time and date specified will not be considered.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>BWXT Pantex (Pantex), a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Amarillo, TX, for the Department of Energy?s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is preparing a solicitation to provide construction services to upgrade Pantex?s electrical distribution system.    
The Pantex Plant electrical distribution system is an electrical network that supplies electricity throughout the plant and in outlying areas of the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas.  Electricity is a required utility as the Pantex Plant relies on electrical power to perform the essential functions of the Plant.  The objective of the EDSU project is to replace approximately 19 miles of overhead power lines (includes the removal of 704 existing poles and installation of 549 new poles) and 1 mile of underground conductors; replace 9 generators and 4 UPS with 4 new generators and 2 UPS; and to replace 12 panel boards and 2 air conditioning units.
This project shall provide turnkey Contractor services for Pantex. These services shall be for the equipment / material procurements, construction, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing ?mark-ups?) for the EDSU project.
The scope of this project consists of two major tasks:  (1.) Generator /UPS /Panel board /HVAC Replacement (GUPHR), and (2.) Overhead-Electrical-Power-Line-Replacement (OEPLR).  The OEPLR task shall upgrade most of the Plant?s aging overhead electrical power poles. In addition to the power poles, lighting poles will also be replaced in several locations.   The scope of both tasks includes disconnecting operating facilities and reconnecting power.
The successful contractor will be required to submit a cutover strategy plan that identifies how electrical power will be provided to facilities during construction activities and how electrical power will be cut over from the existing system to the new.  The new lines shall be installed such that both systems (new & existing) can remain operational independently &/or connected together. The maximum duration for facility outage to perform the actual cutover is limited and will complicate the execution.

EXPECTED RFP DATE IS JUNE 18, 2007
EXPECTED AWARD AND START DATE IS SEPTEMBER 30, 2007

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice issued for market research purposes only.     THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. 

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Information Technology Center (ITC) is responsible for handling and processing the reporting requirements of operators and contractors of the mining community.  Data reported by operators of mining establishments concerning work injuries are summarized by work location, accident classification, part of body injured, nature of injury, occupation, and coal or metal/nonmetal, etc.  Related information on employment, work time, and operating activity is also handled by this office.  Information collected is used to evaluate and develop mine safety and health standards and programs that benefit the industry. MSHA is looking for sources to assist the Agency in planning for and implementing an Electronic Data Capture System (EDCS).
The overall goal of the project is to complete the final phases of the EDCS, ultimately allowing MSHA to realize a maximum return on their initial investment, by building upon the existing EDCS and workflow processes put in place in the initial phases.  Specifically, the goal is to continue to provide further integration with MSHA?s MSIS system by streamlining data capture and workflow processes.  This project will allow MSHA to fully-implement a data capture solution that meets their specific and long-term needs.  As MSHA desires internal and external access to 7000-1 and 7000-2 document information (including amendments and supportive documentation), the ability to analyze, disseminate and report on form information in a timely manner is critical.  This SOW is divided into five iterations, also known as phases.
Specifically, MSHA is seeking sources that possess technical expertise with the following     applications and technologies:
?	Cardiff Teleform v10.1.  5-year minimum experience implementing enterprise-wide, mid to high-volume, mission critical Teleform systems.
?	OpenText eDOCS ECM DM 5.x (formerly Hummingbird DM 5.x).  5-year minimum experience implementing enterprise-wide, mission critical Hummingbird DM systems.  This includes designing, developing, implementing, supporting and documenting Hummingbird DM integration with other mission-critical line-of-business systems.
?	Oracle Databases and extensive SQL Scripting using PL/SQL scripts ? 5-year minimum experience.
?	Visual Studio.NET ? 5-year minimum experience designing, developing, testing, implementing, supporting and documenting mission-critical Web and client-based applications written in VB and/or C#.
?	Extensive expertise in data capture, document imaging, workflow and document conversion projects.  Document backfile experience is necessary.  
The vendor will also be  responsible for supporting, modifying, enhancing and further developing the following custom MSHA applications.  
?	Custom Hummingbird DM Release Script (written in Teleform BasicScript?).
?	MSHA Custom Scan Application ? written in Visual Basic.NET using the Kofak ImageControls Toolkit?.  Experience programmatically operating a document imprinter is necessary.
?	As this project is a subsequent phase of an on-going project, it is imperative that the contractor have a working knowledge of the existing EDCS.  
?	Finally, MSHA requires a vendor with a current presence in the Denver, CO 
The vendor will be required to provide project management services for this project.  Services must include issue tracking; resource allocation; study of work; redesign/modification of system as required; liaison between MSHA & vendors as the first tier of support (mitigates MSHA hours spent with third-party vendors to resolve software, hardware, etc., issues) and full system documentation (including SOP, system architectures, administrator guides and end-user quick start guides and training manuals).
Contractor is required to train MSHA personnel on the use and maintenance of the applications.  Training services must include curriculum development, classroom, hands-on, administrator and follow-up training.
All interested parties are requested to respond to this notice by 3:00PM EDT,. Wednesday May 30.     Responses shall include company information as well as details including information concerning operations of a similar size, scope and complexity and should be sent to the contracting officer at beaty.robert@dol.gov no later than 3:00 PM Wednesday, May 30, 2007.  Please forward any questions concerning this announcement to the Contracting Officer by email only. No telephonic questions will be accepted.     

This is a sources sought notice for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposals.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THESE SERVICES EXISTS AND NO CONTRACT FOR THESE SERVICES.  Any subsequent solicitation for this requirement will be limited to those vendors who respond to this sources sought notice.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals.     This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

SUMMARY
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting Market Research to ascertain if there are any commercial sources that can provide alternative means by which printed notices can be provided to the public.  SSA currently generates the vast majority of its printed notices in IBM's Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) in 12 point font, and a very small portion in Microsoft Word format.

SSA is looking to have AFP & Microsoft Word formatted notices converted to one or more of the following formats: 1) audio CD that will play on a standard CD player; 2) Data CD which contains an MP3 file, 3) audio cassette, 4) Braille, 5) large print (18-20 point font), 6) Data CD which contains an accessible PDF.   

SSA is seeking capability statements, a sample of the finished product for each format the vendor is capable of providing and estimated pricing from commercial sources for these services. Attached to this announcement are sample AFP files used to create twenty SSA notices, along with mailing instructions.
Please provide this information no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, June 29, 2007 to Jacqueline Lessig via email at jacqueline.lessig@ssa.gov. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.
Any information provided, including estimated pricing, will not be considered to be confidential procurement information unless clearly marked as such.

DETAILS
1) Average yearly volume of 50,000 to 1 million notices per year. Each notice has an average of 5 pages; with a range of one page to over fifty pages or more.
2) Approximately 90-95% of notice files will be sent to the vendor on a daily basis in IBM's Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) Format. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Function_Presentation The remaining 5-10% will be sent to the vendor in the form of Microsoft Word files or raw text files; 
3)  Although notices may appear to have structural similarities, every notice is custom-designed through complex internal formatting routines. Therefore, vendors should assume that the structure of each individual notice cannot be readily defined against a "template" or "specification document."  Vendors should treat each notice as a unique document; 
4) SSA anticipates that the vendor will desire to use an automated conversion utility to batch convert the AFP files into a file format of their choice, which can then be more easily converted to an alternative format. SSA has identified several vendors that provide conversion utilities which convert AFP files to the Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF); utilities that convert PDF files into MP3 files, audio cd files, and text files; and utilities that convert text files into Braille and large print files.  These utilities can be identified through a Google search.
5) SSA must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d) which requires all federal agencies to ensure that communications disseminated in an electronic format are fully accessible to people with disabilities.   Approximately 60% of SSA's notices contain tables.  In accordance with 36 C.F.R. 1194.22(g), "row and column headers shall be identified for data tables."  In AFP-formatted notices that contain tables, Row and column headers are not identified for individual data table cells.  Conversion and dissemination of these files in an alternative format will require row and column headers to be identified for each table cell to increase readability for the blind or visually impaired.  This applies to the following alternative formats:  1) audio CD that will play on a standard CD player; 2) Data CD which contains an MP3 file, 3) audio cassette, and 4) Data CD which contains an accessible PDF.   In addition, conversion and dissemination of AFP-formatted notices in large print will also require tables (as well as all other text) to be re-formatted to ensure that all information fits on a page(s).  Conversion and dissemination of AFP-formatted notices in Braille will require information presented in tables to be translated into text prior to conversion to Braille;
6)  Similarly, SSA anticipates that the vendor will use an automated batch conversion utility to convert Word Documents to the file format of their choice - where appropriate.  Section 508 concerns mentioned in #5 also apply here; 
7) SSA anticipates that the vendor will package and mail the documents in alternative formats to the mailing address supplied by SSA for each individual document.  The mailing address information will be included with the AFP files provided to the vendor.  
8) SSA requires the alternative formats to be developed, packaged, and mailed within 5 business days of receipt from SSA. 

REQUESTED RESPONSE
SSA is seeking capability statements, a sample of the finished product for each format the vendor is capable of providing and estimated pricing from commercial sources for these services. 
1) SSA is seeking pricing on a per page basis (at different volume levels) to convert to any of the accessible formats referenced above; 
2) SSA is seeking pricing for packaging and mailing on a per page basis (at different volume levels) for each of the accessible formats requested; 
3) SSA is seeking a high level description of the process that will be used to evaluate,  remediate for accessibility, convert to alternative formats, perform quality control, package and mail documents in accessible formats; 
4) SSA is seeking a sample of the finished product for each format that a vendor is capable of providing; and 
5) SSA is seeking guidance from vendors on whether they can meet the requested turnaround time (5 days) for each accessible format, and at what daily output capability. 

EXAMPLES
SSA has included an example of 20 redacted notices for purposes of determining the feasibility and costs of converting large volumes of AFP-formatted SSA notices into formats accessible to those with visual impairments.  The example includes: 
AFP FILES: 
a) TESTAFP.M10CHAUD.R07TEST is the AFP print file that contains the sample notices; 
b) TESTBNR.M10CHAUD.R07TEST is the Banner file containing inserter instructions; and 
c) TESTMRD.M10CHAUD.R07TEST is the Mail Run Data file that the inserter equipment uses to determine the mailing packages and the enclosures required. 

RESOURCE FILES: 
1) the form and page definition source (AFPPD2.txt ); 
2) the page definition object (P1AFP02 and P1AFP01); 
3) the overlays called by the page definition(O1BBOXLF, O1BBOXRT, O18125CI and O1 L8125); 
d) the page segments (S1SGAC10 and S1SGCOMT); and  modified by SSA only Fonts (SSCR10, CSN500, CSN7B0, CSN5H0, CSN7H0, CSN5D0, CSN5B0, CSN580, CSN560 and CSU5B0) 

Certain IBM licensed fonts have not been included but are used in the printing are CR10, 1AOA, PNET, 394P18, 393P36.  The vendor must obtain their own licenses to these fonts to process these files.

The formdef  F1AFPCS goes with pagedef  P1AFP01 (Type D) and the formdef  F1AFPRR goes with pagedef  P1AFP02 (Type C).  The Type D is for 2 up duplex printing. The Type C is for cut sheet printing.

Both files TESTAFP.M10CHAUD.R07TEST and TESTBNR.M10CHAUD.R07TEST can be printed with either combination of the formdef and pagedef listed above, depending on the type of printer used.  The printed samples used F1AFPCS and P1AFP01 to print TESTAFP.M10CHAUD.R07TEST.

The TESTMRD.M10CHAUD.R07TEST file is for the intelligent insert equipment only.  It is used by the inserter equipment to determine the number of sheets of paper to insert and what enclosures to pull from the enclosure bins, or if manual handling is required.  

AFP files can be printed using a mainframe running the Z/OS ver 1.7 operating system and IBM's PSF (Print Services Facility) ver 3.4.0.  SSA uses IBM''s Utility Program, IEBGENER to send the print file to the printer for internal printing.    A fully printed version can be requested by contacting Jacqueline Lessig via email at jacqueline.lessig@ssa.gov.

<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Vaisala, Inc., 10 D Gill St., Woburn, MA  01901-1721 for Five Hundred Fifty (550) probes/DTT1 transmitter assemblies over a five year period.   The Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) automatically collects weather data and provides accurate, 24-hour accumulated weather reports to local weather observers; weather forecasters airport personnel, including pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC's); and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Weather Service (NWS) personnel.  The current ASOS Dewpoint reporting sensor is the Vaisala DTS1 Dewpoint Temperature Sensor.  The DTS1 Probe/Transmitter Assembly (S100-2MT4-3A1A1) is the primary assembly of nine field replaceable assemblies in the DTS1 electronics enclosure.  DTS1 Probe/Transmitter is a proprietary Vaisala assembly that measures relative humidity (RH) and temperature and calculates dewpoint temperature.  The DTS1 Probe/Transmitter performs extensive self-diagnostics and measures its own internal temperature to control the internal heating of the electronics enclosure.  The Transmitter itself monitors a unique HUMICAP transducer that is a capacitive thin-film polymer with hygroscopic properties and a temperature sensor.  The transmitter interprets changes in capacitance of the transducer, however as the polymer becomes saturated with water molecules, capacitance measurements become increasingly difficult.  To compensate for this difficulty, for measurements above 93%RH, the thin-film polymer is heated and the heat enthalpy with respect to water, saturation pressure and other variables are used to calculate the dewpoint using standard and Vaisala proprietary equations.  The COTS Vaisala DTS1 Probe/Transmitter power monitoring and control function was specifically modified to be compatible with the ASOS software communications.
Because the Vaisala DTS1 Dewpoint Temperature Sensor has been subject to multiple seasons of testing to ensure the reporting precision and accuracy required for aviation and climatology per the ASOS Specification, and is a unique vendor proprietary system that was specifically modified for ASOS, Vaisala is the only known source of supply.  To acquire any other manufacturers? transmitter will require extensive software re-development and hardware integration, as well as an extensive integration and testing efforts at considerable costs that cannot be recovered by the Government through open competition.  If the DTS1 probe/Transmitter Assembly (S100-2MT4-3A1A1) is not available as a logistics spare to sustain operational requirements, the ability to report aviation weather forecasts for aviation safety and operations as well as the climatologic record.  

The probes are to be purchased for the National Weather Service, National Logistics Support Center (NLSC).  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not intended to be a competitive proposal.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by submitting a required qualifications statement.  In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed product data concerning their capability to provide the supplies that will satisfy the Governments needs.  All proposals received within fifteen (15) days after the date of  publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  

Central Region Acquisition Division, requires that all Contractors doing business with this officer be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.  For additional information to register in CCR, please access the following web site:  http://www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Retractable Markers to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of Retractable Markers to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of retractable markers by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following products to the P/L:

Retractable Markers
7520-00-NIB-1653 ? Highlighter, Yellow, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 1 DZ Blister Carded
7520-00-NIB-1654 ? Highlighter, Yellow, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 4/PG Blister Carded
7520-00-NIB-1663 ? Marker, Permanent, Chisel Tip, Retractable, Black, 4/pk
7520-00-NIB-1665 ? Marker, Permanent, Fine Tip, Retractable, 4/pk assorted colors (Black, Blue, Red, Green)
7520-00-NIB-1666 - Marker, Permanent, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 4/pk assorted colors (Black, Blue, Red, Green)
7520-00-NIB-1773 ? Highlighter, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 10-color set (3 yellow, 2 pink, 1 orange, 2 green, 2 blue)
7520-00-NIB-1788 ? Highlighter, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 5-color set (yellow, blue, pink, green, orange)
7520-00-NIB-1789 ? Market, Permanent, Fine Tip, Retractable, Black, 4/pack 
7520-00-519-5769 ? Market, Dry Erase, Chisel Tip, Retractable, 4 assorted colors (black, Blue, Red, Green)

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Retractable Markers to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

AVE-59403			AVE-59498		AVE-49498			SAN-32728
AVE-49489			AVE-59402		SAN-28175			AVE-49910
AVE-69489

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing retractable markers to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 20, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and proposals are requested.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16, effective 22 March 2007.  North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541618 (other mgmt consulting services) applies to this procurement.  The United States Special Operations Command has a requirement for training on Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) culture and CIA counterterrorism (CT) targeting methods and practices.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for five training courses developed by the contractor and administered within 12 months of award.  Training shall occur at USSOCOM HQ, MacDill AFB FL, 33621. A conference room and projector will be provided.  All other labor, materials and equipment shall be provided by the contractor.  Contractor team individual(s) supporting this task will need to be cleared at the TS/SCI level at the start of the task.  At the discretion of the government, selected individuals supporting this task may require access to Special Access Program (SAP)/Focal Point (FP) information.  Access to SAP/FP information requires the requisite security clearance based on a security investigation with a date less than 5 years old and requires employees to undergo additional personnel security screening meeting the DoD SAP/FP-accessing directives and policies. Contractors may require access to SCI, SAP, and Focal Point Information in performance of this effort.  Training is required for a maximum of 40 students per class with a total of 5 classes required.  The government anticipates that the performance work statement (PWS) resulting from the following statement of objectives (SOO) will result in a training class lasting approximately five days each, with eight hours of training per day.  The required results of this training are outlined in the following SOO for each of the two performance objectives.  The first objective is to increase SOCOM knowledge of CIA culture.  The second objective is to increase SOCOMs effectiveness when working with CIA targeteers on counterterrorism (CT) intelligence support and mission planning.  SOO:  OBJECTIVE ONE: CIA Culture; required results, at a minimum, include increased academic knowledge on the following:  1. Cultural differences between the CIA and Special Operations Forces (SOF) 2.  Strategies for increasing cooperation between the CIA and SOF both in theatre and at HQ SOCOM and recent examples where cooperation succeeded and failed at both levels.  3.  Exercises, at both levels, which will allow students to demonstrate an ability to work effectively with CIA on CT analysis and mission planning. 4.  Demonstration of successful completion of this course means a student will be able to understand the cultural differences between the CIA and SOCOM, operate within the CIA environment, request information from the CIA and support a CIA-lead operation.  OBJECTIVE TWO: Required results for CIA CT targeting, at a minimum, include increased academic knowledge and demonstrated capability on the following:  1. Targeting methods and practices overview 2.  Targeting as analytical support to operations  3.  Targeting as adding structure and process to operations, including the basics of human assets and the human source acquisition cycle  4.  CIA targeting concepts and methodologies  5.  An applicable targeting exercise bringing together all instructional areas  6.  Demonstration of successful completion of this course means a student will understand DoD and CIA targeting, roles of targeteers, philosophies of targeting and the differences between DoD and CIA in each of these areas.  All proposals are due by 5 June 2007 at 4:00 pm EST to Jeff W. Burhart via email.  Facsimiles will be accepted but you must contact Jeff W. Burhart prior to faxing.

The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to provide AFFTC with efficient and effective performance-based supply services by a highly-qualified, fully trained, professional, and dedicated workforce.  To this end, the contractor shall execute established procedures outlined in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, Volume 1 through 9 (USAF Supply Manual), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 23-201 (Fuels Management), and Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI) 23-201 (LMCA Operation Instruction), in a manner that ensures best use of resources in support of assigned missions.  The contractor must continuously keep abreast of, and implement, all technical changes and upgrades to standard systems in order to ensure mission readiness.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Afghanistan/Pakistan Police Program Officer (US Personal Services Contract)
US Department of State
Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs
Washington, DC

I.	STATEMENT OF DUTIES
BACKGROUND: This position is located in the Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan (INL/AP), Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Department of State.  INL/AP administers a $400 million program to reform, train, mentor, and professionalize the Afghan National Police (ANP) force for the Government of Afghanistan (GOA), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).  The program has grown in size substantially since its inception in late 2002 ? the budget has increased more than tenfold and the lone foreign affairs officer managing the various components of the program has become seriously over-extended.  Additionally, the focus of the international community on the need for a more professional police force including the critical need for a greater focus on anti-corruption efforts with the Afghan Ministry of Interior as well as more professionalization and specialized training requirements for the police force as a whole necessitate the expansion of the management team in INL/AP.  As the program begins to shift into this more intensive phase of specialized training and support, the need for in-house law enforcement expertise to augment existing program management expertise has become equally critical.  The contractor will serve as one of INL/AP?s principal program officers and the law enforcement expert in charge of overseeing police reform, training and mentoring policy implementation, as well as overseeing program implementation by the INL contractor(s) in Afghanistan.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:  The contractor works under the supervision of the Director of INL/AP, however, the individual exercises wide latitude for independent action, designing programs and implementing approved new programs under general supervision.  Completed work is reviewed for timeliness and effectiveness. 	

II.	STATEMENT OF WORK

Serves as one of INL?s principal program officers and law enforcement expert in charge of overseeing the INL police reform, training, and mentoring program in Afghanistan.

Specific program management responsibilities include:

Management of the INL police training/mentoring budget, including preparation of the annual INL program budgets and program development and support (PD&S) budgets; monitoring project implementation and financial reports to remain within budget; providing periodic financial reports to INL; and identifying and taking steps to reprogram excess funds.

Through regular travel to Afghanistan, conducting end-use monitoring to ensure that personnel, training, equipment and other commodities provided to the host government are appropriate for the goals and objectives of the program.

Collect and reports information relevant to the Afghan police program and overall Afghanistan law enforcement development.

Provides policy papers utilizing a strong law enforcement background on critical fast-breaking issues, to apprise senior officials, or for presentation by senior Department officials before members of Congress and their staffs, the media, and the public, as appropriate.

Interview, screen and hire prospective candidates for the INL Afghan police mentoring program, and prepare appropriate briefings and training for accepted candidates, as necessary.

III.	LEVEL OF EFFORT

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a six (6) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N68836-03-D-0021 for husbanding services with Puerto Rico in order to develop and compete a regional Continental United States (CONUS) husbanding service provider contract in 2007/2008.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in the Canada, Caribbean, Central America, Mexico and South American (3CMS) solicitation being competed as of the date of this synopsis. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received. Question: Do you have any specific/general guidance on external and internal door requirements?  Non-Breachable or breachable?  If breachable: mechanical, explosive or ballistic breaching? Minimum number? Answer: Ft. Carson would prefer the following door configuration: 1 exterior entry door and 1 interior door for each of the 4 rooms.  No specific requirement has been identified for breachable or non-breachable doors.   Question: Minimum Projectile Encapsulation: 1,000-1,500 5.56mm, 62 grain, Full Metal Jacket rounds - upon/within what surface area (in square feet or inches)? Answer: Square Feet Question: Respondents assume that the government will prepare the shoot house site (less concrete pad), provide all environmental or other required permits, and provide any/all utilities to the area? Answer: A concrete pad for the shoot house is not desired, an adequate building surface will be provided.  Ft. Carson will provide all environmental and other required permits.  There will be no utilities at the site. Question: Offerors must provide complete specifications for CLIN 0001 Modular Live Shoot House with Observation Catwalk - but do not have to provide complete specifications on expandable capabilities of shoot house? I understood the term modular to mean expandable. Answer: Ft. Carson desires a shoot house that may be expanded by the addition of interlocking modules, the ability to expand the shoot house by 2 or 3 stories, and the ability to add interior and/or exterior stair clearing towers.  At this time, there are no addit ional specifications or requirements for the expansion.  A shoot house that will meet current and future training needs is desired. Clarification regarding CLIN 0002 - Ballistic Flooring. Though the Solicitation states, Ballistic Flooring - Vulcanized ballistic rubber flooring to be delivered and installed inside proposed Shoot House.  Flooring shall meet the ballistic rubber properties of the shoot house walls described above, one could in fer the Government is seeking Vulcanized Ballistic Rubber Flooring -- as opposed to the totality of ballistic protection afforded by the Modular Shoot house Walls. Question: Can Offerors assume that the Government means the ballistics integrity/safety of the floor shall be equal to that afforded by the wall (design)? Answer: The Government desires vulcanized ballistic rubber flooring that meets the same minimum ballistic rubber physical properties described in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  Minimum ballistic rubber physical properties to include:  Minimum density: 69.5 l bs per cubic foot; Minimum compression/deflection: 9,500 psi to reduce the product by 20% of its original size, more than 36,000 psi to reduce the product 50% of its original size; Low (cold) temperature before cracking: -50 degrees Celsius; Minimum projec tile encapsulation: 1,000-1,500 5.56mm, 62 grain, Full Metal Jacket rounds and up; Minimum hardness: 48-69 points on the shore A Durometer Scale (equal to medium hardness) Question: Is there any reseeding or erosion control (reclamation) work to be done on this project?   Answer No
