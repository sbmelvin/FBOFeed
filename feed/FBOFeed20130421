<p>Interested parties shall take reasonable steps to ascertain the nature and location of the project area and the work to be completed, as well as the general and local site conditions which can affect the work and cost of performance. Failure to take the actions described in this paragraph will not relieve the Contractor from the responsibility of properly estimating the difficulty and cost to successfully perform the work, or from successful completion of the work without additional expense to the Government.<br /><br />The solicitation will be available on approximately 6 May 2013 and can be downloaded from this website at that time.</p>
