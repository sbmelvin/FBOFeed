<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an electron beam lithography system for the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML) Nanofab.  The e-beam lithography system is to be used for both direct write lithography and mask writing. 

The Contractor is responsible for supplying the lithography system as well as any vibration, acoustic, and electromagnetic isolation required to meet the technical specifications.  

The NIST AML Nanofab will be operated as a shared access user facility.  This means that the staff of NIST and its partners, subject to provisions, training, and user fees, will be permitted to independently operate much of the equipment.  

The e-beam lithography tool being procured will likely have only two certified operators.  The tools will be operated in a manner such that a wide variety of materials can be processed.  The facility will be directed by NIST’s Semiconductor Electronics Division. Unlike other Nanofabs, the NIST AML Nanofab is unique in that it is located next to the most advanced metrology tools in the world, and its focus will be on fabricating nanoscale structures necessary for metrology and standards in support of the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and homeland security.  

This requirement is being procured using Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0673.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 7, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS SHALL BE JULY 28, 2005.
