<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice of the Government's intent to issue a multiple award, firm-fixed-price (FFP),  IDIQ solicitation for internal security services to be provided at various locations within the Iraqi theater.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12--the solicitation will be for the acquisition of a commercial item.
The Government intends to execute an unrestricted procurement action in order to award a multiple award, firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle for internal security services at various locations within the Iraqi theater.  Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARs) 252.225-7040:  CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL AUTHORIZED TO ACCOMPANY U.S. ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (JUN 2006) will apply. See http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252225.htm#252.225-7040

Each Task Order will contain a pre-established contract line item number (CLIN) structure for mobilization, security operations, and de-mobilization.  Task Order 0001 will accompany the solicitation.  Each offeror will be required to propose prices on Task Order 0001 when submitting offers. 
Basis of Award:  It is anticipated that the evaluation factors for award will be: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Price, and (3) Past Performance.  For the initial multiple IDIQ award, it is the Government's intent that Technical capability will be rated as acceptable or unacceptable, and past performance will be considered more important than price. Furthermore, it is the Government's intent that follow-on task orders will be competed based on price. Offerors are advised that the Government will seek proposals which demonstrate the best value at a reasonable, realistic, and affordable price based on the evaluation factors listed above. Offers found technically unacceptable will be removed from consideration. 
Using Price-Performance Trade-Off methodologies, the goal of the multiple award IDIQ procurement action will be to award to 3 or more responsive, technically acceptable offerors who represent the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or to other than the highest past performance rating if the Contracting Officer determines that doing so would result in the best value to the Government.
The resultant awards are anticipated to have a base period with option periods.  
Future task orders for internal security services in the Iraqi theater will be competed exclusively amongst the IDIQ awardees.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The United States Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) intends to award a sole-source purchase order to General Dynamics C4 Systems for SelectFocus Ima ge for the Common Ground Station PPSS program (CGS).  The acquisition is under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The non-competitive proposed contract will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and will be accomplished  using commercial acquisition procedures in accordance with (IAW) FAR part 12.  SelectFocus Image is a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product produced and exclusively available from General Dynamics C4 Systems.  This product was included in the CGS Common  Software Baseline 4.0 because it is the only available product that provides for multiple operator selectable areas of interest (AOI) to preserve image detail, while highly compressing background/contextual portions of the image in order to transfer an im age over limited bandwidth channels.  The image file size is completely adjustable by the source side user prior to sending the image.  The user on the receive side system may save the image in a number of industry standard formats such as NITF 2.1.  This product supports the important CGS requirement to share imagery with other, remotely located CGS systems via SIPRnet.  In order to be considered, any interested respondents must have a valid CAGE code, must be registered in the CCR, and must submit clear and convincing documentation to their capability within the time specified.  The closing date for this synopsis will be  the Close of Business (COB) 22 September 2006.  The Government Point of Contact (POC) for this acquisition is Vicki Kormann, Contracting Officer, 732-427-1477,  e-mail: Vicki.kormann@us.army.mil. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Government's ultimate approach nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs.  The US ARMY C-E LCM C has established the IBOP website as part of the Army's Single Face to Industry (ASFI), to allow electronic posting of solicitations for Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), and Invitation for Bids (IF B) from C-E LCMC to industry.  All parties interested in doing business with the C-E LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

Definitions are as follows: ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offerors technical proposal must de monstrate it can meet all requirements in the Statement of Work. UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements of the Statement of work will be determined unacceptable. Past Performance will be evaluated as high risk, medium risk and low risk with definitions as follows: Unsatisfactory / High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on the solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance re cords under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation. Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chroni cally failed to meet contract terms. -Satisfactory / Moderate Risk - Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation. Verification of past per formance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Good / Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's preponderance of good, if not excellent past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation. Verification of past perform ance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. - Offeror without technical or insufficient technical info rmation to show that their offer meets the performance work statement shall not be evaluated for award.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to a Previous Notice is to change the Set-Aside Option, update items (iv) and (xv). The Set-Aside option is changed from:  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned to:  N/A.  (iv) This solicitation is being advertised to concerns who can meet Qualification Requirements.  (xv) Federal Business Opportunity Numbered Note 23 applies.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2. The solicitat ion identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation      52.209-1  Qualification Requirements.  As prescribed in 9.206-2, insert the following clause:  QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (FEB 1995)  (a) Definition. Qualification requirement, as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.  (b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component o f an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not th e name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.  (Name) ___________________________________________  (Address) _________________________________________  (c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.  Offerors Name _____________________________________  Manufacturers Name______ __________________________  Sources Name _____________________________________  Item Name ________________________________________  Service Identification ________________________________  Test Number _______________________________________ (to the extent known)  (d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Governments best interests.  (e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Governments interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.  (f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or per formed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.  (End of clause)
