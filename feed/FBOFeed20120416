<DESC>Pre-solicitation Synopsis to Potential Offerors 16 Apr 2012 Solicitation Number: FA8770-12-R-0003 Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) Subject Matter Experts (SME) NAICS Code: 541519; Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M in annual average gross revenue for the last three fiscal years, as defined by FAR Part 19 Set Aside: None Classification Code: D, Information Technology Services, Including Telecommunications Services; 399, Other Automated Data Processing and Telecommunications Services Estimated Release of the Request for Proposal: 4 May 2012 This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that the Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Enterprise Logistics Systems (ELS), Contracting Division (ESC/HGGK) anticipates the release of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) under solicitation number FA8770-12-R-0003 for functional and technical Subject Matter Expert (SME) services for the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) under full and open competition procedures. The formal announcement will provide all final RFP documents for this requirement. Information regarding this requirement was previously posted under Announcements R2962, REMIS Subject Matter Experts (SME) Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information. No further information will be posted under the announcement number/title. Proposed Contract Line Items CLIN 0001 Labor (FFP) CLIN 0002 Data (NSP) CLIN 0003 Other Direct Costs (ODC) (CR) CLIN 0004 Travel (CR) Background REMIS is a large, complex, legacy unclassified information system featuring a centralized database containing Air Force-wide inventory/status/utilization data, maintenance data and configuration data. The data is reported from base level units, Air Logistics Centers (ALC) and operating locations all over the world. REMIS was designed to enhance the front-end design of new weapon systems and to increase the readiness and sustainability of existing United States Air Force weapon systems by improving the availability, accuracy and flow of essential equipment information. REMIS provides the capability to collect, edit, validate, process, store and report reliability and maintainability data on Aerospace Vehicles, Missiles, Trainers, Automated Test Equipment (ATE), selected Support Equipment (SE), Communications-Electronics (C-E) equipment and the newly acquired Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles in the following functional areas: Equipment Maintenance, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), Time Change Inspection (TCI), Configuration, Debriefing, Inventory, Status and Utilization. REMIS functionality is split across its subsystems, which include: &bull; Equipment Inventory, Multiple Status and Utilization Reporting Subsystem (EIMSURS) provides worldwide inventory tracking for AFI 21-103 and AFI 16-402 reportable equipment. It provides an automated correlation process by end-item serial number for all inventory gain, loss and termination transactions. It provides equipment status statistics for mission capable rates to assess equipment effectiveness and combat readiness worldwide. It provides equipment utilization statistics for flying hours, sorties, etc., for aircraft, trainers and ATE. &bull; Product Performance Subsystem (PPS) collects and provides On-Equipment and Off-Equipment Maintenance Data Collection type data and Support General Data. Analysts can use this type of data to spot negative trends on a particular equipment component or to analyze manpower utilization per sortie or flying hour. &bull; Generic Configuration Status Accounting Subsystem (GCSAS) enables control of and access to approved configuration of equipment, serialized controlled items and Computer Program Identification Numbers (CPINs). It also holds contractor loaded configuration data until validation by the appropriate authority: Program Management Office (PMO), Item Managers (IMs), Program Managers (PMs), etc. It also allows loading of TCTO data directly into REMIS by the appropriate OPR. &bull; Multi-Service Interface Agent (MSIA) supports the transfer and translation of CV-22 reliability and maintainability data between the Air Force and Navy maintenance systems. REMIS is the primary Air Force maintenance system, and the Optimized Organizational Maintenance Activity (OOMA) is the primary Navy maintenance system. The MSIA subsystem also has interfaces to facilitate the transfer of data between REMIS and the Navy&rsquo;s Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized (CAMEO) system and between REMIS and the contractor technology repair center&rsquo;s Osprey Support Network (OSN). REMIS is designated a critical financial feeder system for Aerospace Vehicles as defined by AFI 16-402, recording and tracking asset valuation, depreciation, and moving average cost activities for Military Equipment and Operating Materials and Supplies. Eventually, REMIS capabilities and functionality will be absorbed into an Air Force enterprise level product under the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) program. Scope of Services The Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) Program Management Office (PMO) requires functional and technical Subject Matter Expert (SME) services. The SMEs must also be familiar with Program Management processes and procedures in accordance with Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, DoD Instruction 5000.02 and Government tracking tools. SMEs are individuals with a specific level of expertise in certain key system areas or disciplines, knowledgeable about the domain being represented, and provide unique and in-depth functional and technical knowledge on the application and system operations required to support the using community. REMIS SMEs are required to demonstrate their expert knowledge of REMIS; the REMIS system environment; and the Air Force users and processes that support, manage, and perform maintenance of weapons systems and other reportable equipment for the Air Force enterprise. SMEs shall have expert knowledge of the Air Force directives that document those Air Force maintenance processes (AFI 16-402, AFI 21-103, AFI 21-101, and the 00-20 series Technical Orders). REMIS SMEs shall have in depth understanding of REMIS functionality and the importance of that functionality to formation of policy and weapon system decision making. Scope of Requirements The general scope of the SMEs responsibilities include: &bull; Gather requirement information from users, determining whether applicable to REMIS and valid under Air Force processes and regulations.

All potential offerors are required to have an adequate accounting system for determining costs applicable to the contract. Draft requirement documents may be made available on the REMIS SME posting at the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s discretion, prior to RFP release. Once made available, all questions and comments applicable to these documents are encouraged in order to gain industry feedback for RFP finalization. Any correspondence should specify whether a firm is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business, as well as whether it is a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Due to security access limitations on the expected places of contract performance, foreign prime contract offerors will be excluded from this procurement. Information Assurance The solicitation will include DFARS clause 252.239-7001, &ldquo;Information Assurance Contractor Training and Certification.&rdquo; Potential offerors will be responsible for assuring that certain employees comply with the DoD Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, per DoD 8570.01-M, dated 15 May 2008, as required.

Early involvement with our industry partners is a key element of the ESC OCI process, and it is critical for the Government to be able to identify any potential OCI issues as early as possible for an acquisition. This would allow ample time to address and evaluate any potential OCI issues, if required, prior to contract award with minimal impact to critical acquisition schedules. Interested vendors are requested to evaluate your potential OCI issues with regard to this requirement for SME services for REMIS, and the Contractor is encouraged to identify any OCI issues, as stated in FAR 9.5 to the Contracting Officer (CO). This will assist the CO in determining if the contractor will need to submit an OCI Mitigation Plan for any solicitation that might result from this notice. Ombudsman The ESC Ombudsman, located at Hanscom AFB, MA, serves as the Ombudsman for all of ESC, including its Geographically Separated Units. The Ombudsman hears concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, communicates those concerns to ESC/CC, ESC&rsquo;s Deputy for Acquisition (DC(A)) or ESC&rsquo;s Deputy for Support (DC(S)) from industry or Government personnel, and assists in the resolution of those concerns. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry. Contact information for the ESC Ombudsman is as follows: ESC/CS Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 Telephone #: 781-377-5106 FAX: 781-377-4659 E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil Conclusion This Pre-Solicitation Synopsis does not constitute a RFP and is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB). It does not restrict the Government to the ultimate procurement approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Furthermore, potential offerors are reminded and cautioned that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to obligate the Government. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the offeror for costs, if any, associated with this Pre-Solicitation Synopsis.

<SUBJECT>Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator (C-SCAN)
<SOLNBR>DARPA-BAA-12-44
<RESPDATE>071012
<ARCHDATE>01102013
<CONTACT>Dr. Andrei Shkel, Program Manager, Email DARPA-BAA-12-44@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of co-integration of inertial sensors with dissimilar physics of operation in a single  micro-scale Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In this context, the program seeks to address  challenges associated with the long-term drift, dynamic range, and start-up time of chip-scale components for positioning, targeting, navigation, and guidance tasks. Specific interest is in the development of a Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator (C-SCAN) that combines inertial sensors with dissimilar, but complementary, physics of operation into a single microsystem. The main objectives of the C-SCAN program are to (1) explore the miniaturization and co-fabrication of atomic sensors with high-performance solidstate inertial sensors, and (2) develop combinatorial algorithms and architectures that seamlessly co-integrate components with dissimilar physics in a single ensemble. The deliverable of this program is a miniature IMU that co-integrates atomic and solid-state inertial sensors in a single microsystem with a volume of no more than 20 cubic centimeters (20 cc) and power consumption of no more than 1 Watt (1 W). The performance of C-SCAN is expected to be above and beyond what is currently available, combining a high resolution of motion detection (10-4 deg/hour for rotation and 10-6 g for linear acceleration), exceptional long-term bias and scale-factor stability (1 ppm with respect to the full-scale of operation), and start-up time performance orders of magnitude better than available today (less than 10 seconds from a cold start).

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for a seven-year program, the NHLBI Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network). The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-HR-14-01. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
<p>The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials to prevent, treat, and/or improve the outcome of patients with or at risk for Acute Lung Injury (ALI). More than one trial will be conducted simultaneously and it is expected that multiple, complex trials will be completed during the course of the contract. The emphasis is expected to be on prevention and early treatments. The Network will consist of approximately eleven Clinical Centers (CCs), each with at least one other recruiting site, and a CCC. Each CC will have two principal investigators from one institution that represent (1) an intensive care unit clinician and (2) another clinical investigator, such as an emergency department clinician, with early access to patients at risk for lung injury. The CCs shall also include at least one other institution that will participate in enrollment and study conduct but not network leadership. Each CC will be expected to enroll a total of 220 subjects over 5 &frac12; years of a seven-year project.</p>
<p>The CCC will coordinate all aspects of the research and communication within the Network, including development of protocols, management and analysis of data, assurance of data quality, and statistical and clinical leadership. The CCC will be responsible for collecting and archiving biospecimens during the contract, and depositing the specimens in the NHLBI biorepository at the end of studies. The CCC will be expected to provide the technical leadership to advise the steering committee on the potential and proper techniques for biospecimen collection from critically ill patients that will be useful in developing longitudinal molecular phenotypes. This may be achieved by a subcontract to a commercial or academic entity.</p>
<p>Research conducted by this Network should utilize the most modern and flexible electronic data collection, transfer, decision support, and monitoring. Members of the Network will be encouraged to participate in a collaborative Institutional Review Board program to reduce the time and redundancy of protocol approvals and monitoring. As this is developed, the CCC will be responsible for communication with the Network of CCs.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS.  For the past 35 years, the EPA has purchased approximately 90% of the research animals utilized by the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) under an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract from Charles River Laboratories.  The animals are required for the conduct of a long-range series of short- and long-term research studies on health effects of a wide range of pollutants under varying conditions.  This effort will be procured on a sole-source basis from Charles River Laboratories.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.02-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?  Approximately 80% of these studies are of a continuing or comparative nature, and will require additional animals of the same genetic background in order to produce data that are reliable, reproducible, and viable over time and place.  The NHEER L research data have been published in peer-reviewed journals and used to set EPA regulatory standards.  It is critical that future research be conducted with rodent models whose genetic constitutions are well defined, stable, and as unvarying as possible to avoid a negative impact to historical-data reliability.  All commercial suppliers of research animals maintain specific strains or substrains of laboratory rodents as separate, closed breeding colonies.  Primarily through spontaneous mutations or genetic drift, these strains or substrains develop a unique genetic composition that will differ from the same strain or substrain from a different supplier.  Differences in genetic composition can introduce study variability that can negatively impact study results, conflict with previous results, and challenge interpretations of a large body of published data.  The Agency has concluded (and numerous studies have demonstrated) that where inter-comparability of data is required  from one study to another, it is necessary to use a common source of supply to eliminate extraneous variables.  Use of animals from a supplier other than Charles River would introduce such genetic, microbiological, and virological variables which would invalidate the research data base and make comparability of data scientifically impossible.  For these reasons, the Agency has decided to solicit Charles River Laboratories on a non-competitive basis for the majority of its laboratory animal requirements.  Approximately twenty types of research animals of various strains, sexes, ages, weights, etc., may be purchased, including but not limited to: Long Evans Rats; CD IGS Rats; Wistar Rats; F344 (CDF) Rats; Sprague-Dawley (CD) Rats; SHHF Rats; WKY Rats; SHR Rats; Brown Norway Rats; Stroke Prone SHR/SP Rats; F-344/N SASCO Rats; Lewis Rats; CD-1 Mice; BALB/C Mice; C57 BL/6 Mice; C3H Mice; B6C3F1 Mice; New Zealand White Rabbits; LVG Golden Syrian Hamsters; and, Hartley Guinea Pigs.   The primary basis for limiting competition is the Agency?s conclusion that there is substantial evidence that animals that are not identical genetically, virologically, and bacteriologically to animals previously used in our research introduce unquantifiable variables into the research protocol and that such variables cast unavoidable doubt on the significance of variations on research results.  That element of doubt is of such concern to EPA that it would require a definitive and conclusive demonstration of the error of the conclusion before opening this solicitation for competition.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract.  The contract will have a base period of 12 months with four 12-month options.  Anyone wishing to request reconsideration of the Justification for a non-competitive procurement must provide such a demonstration to the Agency within 15 days of this Notice.  Any such inform ation submitted will be evaluated according to its conclusiveness.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The new local governance project will assist with coordination of USG implementers in communes targeted for LOKAL Plus services to ensure USG programs are accountable to local institutions, to align efforts, and to seek synergies.&nbsp; LOKAL Plus will build the capacity of local institutions to respond to their constituencies and to promote their own development agenda.&nbsp; Most importantly, the efforts of LOKAL Plus will consolidate the gains made in other USG program areas such as health, rule of law, and urban planning by increasing the ability of targeted municipalities to leverage these services as a strategy for sustainability and economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Finally, the project will support and complement the Haitian government&rsquo;s own recently launched decentralization program.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">LOKAL Plus will help to improve public services in targeted communes through the following five project results: </span></p>

<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Leveraging greater access to central government funding and services;<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The Government of Haiti is highly centralized economically as well as politically.&nbsp; The Port-au-Prince metropolitan area accounts for more than 65% of the country&rsquo;s economic activity and 85% of tax revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most public services are concentrated in the capital.&nbsp; The government&rsquo;s weak institutional capacity to deliver basic public services is particularly acute at the local level, especially municipalities and secondary cities located at a distance from the metropolitan area, including virtually all rural areas.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">LOKAL Plus will help to improve public services (in targeted communes) through five intermediate sub-results.&nbsp; For contracting purposes these five will be termed &ldquo;preferred outcomes&rdquo; as follows: </span></p>

<DESC><p>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the Local Governance Project (LPG) in Tajikistan utilizing full and open competition. <br /><br />The objective of the program is to strengthen the enabling environment for decentralization at the national level and improve sub-national government capacity and performance. At the national level, the project will support the Government of Tajikistan's ongoing process of implementing the 2009 Law on Local Self-Government in Towns and Townships, with particular focus on fiscal decentralization and housing and communal services reform. At the sub-national level, the project will work with jamoat administrations to adapt to the new functions and budgetary authorities devolved through these legislative reforms, while strengthening communal service provision. This project will also strengthen local constituencies for self-governance and foster regular communication and participatory decision-making between local government, citizens, NGOs and private enterprises. Finally, the project will make strategic investments in clean drinking water systems in order to catalyze the effective decentralization of services and to address critical health and food security needs in rural communities.<br /><br />The Local Governance Project will consist of three main results:<br /><br />1. Strengthened legal enabling environment to support sub-national governance<br />2. Sub-national government entities are more effective in meeting citizens' needs<br />3. Increased participation of constituents in sub-national government decision-making and service provision.<br /><br />The proposed activities are anticipated for a period of 60 months, with an estimated start date of October 1, 2012.<br /><br />Issuance of this notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirements in FAR 5.201. <br /><br />All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, that will be posted no less than 15 days after this notice. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor www.fbo.gov for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquires will not be accepted.</p>

The anticipated award date will be on or about June 2012.<br><br>This announcement is for the construction of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Campus East (NCE) - Third Floor Build Out at the Tech Center located in Springfield, VA.<br><br>PROPOSAL PERIOD:  The proposed solicitation is scheduled for release on or about 2 May 2012.  <br><br>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing a best value source selection procedure as described in FAR 15.3 with a 30 day response time after issuance.<br><br>In using this approach, the Government seeks to award a contract to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements.  Estimated magnitude range of this acquisition is between $25,000,000.00 to $100,000,000.00.  <br><br>All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database to be eligible to receive award http://www.ccr.gov  and have completed the On-line Representations and Certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <br><br>The entire solicitation will be posted at this website https://www.fbo.gov .  Telephone requests will not be honored. <br><br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<br>1.0	OBJECTIVE:  The Issued-For-Construction (IFC) package for the NGA Third Floor Build Out of the Technology Center contains completed drawings and specifications for fitting out 29,500 SF room that currently has a bare concrete floor depressed 3' from grade, CMU walls and concrete ceiling with pendant industrial lights. The work will transform this space into a state of the art Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability and concurrent maintainability with a power density of 150 watts/SF designed around a hot aisle/cold aisle cooling concept. This project will upgrade critical IT infrastructure for NGA, doubling the size of the data center in Springfield, VA.  <br>2.0	SCOPE OF WORK:  Provide and install a fully functional Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability on the third floor of the NCE Technology Center.  A Tier 2 Data Center guarantees 99.741% availability provided by redundant capacity components and single non-redundant distribution paths serving the site's equipment. The Data Center will have UPS and engine generators with a capacity design of Need plus One (N+1), with a single power path.<br>While this is not a complete listing of the scope requirements, following are some specific features of the Data Center further described within the IFC package:<br>2.1	Installation of a raised access floor with stringers grounded to form an equipotential reference plane for the IT racks (provided as GFE equipment) that the contractor will secure to and ground to this floor.<br><br>2.2	Architectural work includes acoustic ceiling, furred gypsum drywall on existing CMU walls, demountable partitions with integral doors, painting, signage and a thorough cleaning after construction is complete to meet data center standards as specified by the International Organization for Standardization Class 8 in accordance with ISO 1466-1.<br><br>2.3	Mechanical work consists of installation of 50+ Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units, chilled water distribution piping, pre-action sprinkler system, chilled water pumps, ductwork, fans and a hydrogen detection system (for UPS battery rooms) as well as a new cooling tower and chiller in the Central Utility Plant.<br><br>2.4	Electrical work includes Power Distribution Units and Remote Power Panel installation in the new data center and all under floor receptacles to power the computer equipment.  Due to the criticality of this facility each piece of computer equipment is fed from 2 different sources to provide redundancy in case of failure of one source.  The electrical system must be installed with redundancy so that failure on any one component will not cause a failure of the IT equipment.  Additionally, the electrical system involves installation of 2 large Uninterruptable Power System arrays of batteries, new rotary uninterruptable systems, new switchgear, new multi-ended unit substations and bus ducts, lighting and options for up to 3 backup diesel generators located outside the Central Utility Plant.    <br><br>2.5	Controls systems work includes expansion of the existing photoelectric fire alarm system. There is an option to replace this with an aspirating laser scanner fire alarm system.  Additionally, an expansion and tie in to the existing building automation system and power monitoring system are in the scope of this project.  It is critical that this be done seamlessly to avoid losing any control and monitoring capability to the existing 24x7, 365 day/year data center.  <br><br>2.6	Telecom work includes installation of a multi level cable tray system and installation of telecom cabling from the existing operational computer room to the new data center.  Access to the existing data center will be severely limited due to operations and all work must be done under security escort. <br><br>2.7	Contractor will need to work in this space under a joint use arrangement with other follow on contractors specifically for IT and security installations.<br><br>3.0	SCHEDULE:  Upon award, the Contractor shall develop a proposed schedule for the completion of all work as described in Section 2.0 above and as further described in the IFC documents.  The schedule shall be developed in accordance with all contract requirements and submitted for review and approval no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).<br>3.1	NGA desired BoD is April 2013. The performance duration will not exceed 14 months (426 calendar days) beyond NTP.<br><br>4.0	SECURITY: <br>4.1	The existing data center is a secure facility located on the 4th floor of the Technology Center and must remain operational 24x7 hours/day, 365 days/year throughout the construction of this project.  Routine outages impacting other areas of the Technology Center or elsewhere on the NGA Campus will NOT BE PERMITTED.  Any outages that must occur will have to be coordinated through an agency outage control board.  This process takes 1 month and is subject to last minute changes due to mission impacts.<br>4.2	This project occurs in an operational Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) so all activities in the project scope will be performed under the supervision of government provided escorts.  Work hours, access to the NGA site, access to the work area will all be restricted and must be coordinated.  These restrictions may include: US workers only, no cellular phones, no cameras, no recording devices, subject to search at any time, inspection of all materials/tools/equipment, pre-coordinated access and approval of any personnel. Utilization of the 'E-Verify' System will likely be required for all personnel & workers accessing the site.<br>5.0	OTHER: The contractor shall conform to the installation policy regarding vehicle and personnel access and any special tenant security requirements.  The contractor shall comply with all requirements for preparation of the Health and Safety plan, in particular, any confined space entry as required as part of this SOW will be conducted per the Health and Safety Plan and applicable Federal, State and Local requirements. <br>All data, reports, submissions, and other materials under this delivery order are property of the US Government and shall not be released by the Contractor or his/her affiliates without written approval by the Contracting Officer.  Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall provide copies of all documentation and unused project information to the Government for use or disposal as appropriate.<br>6.0	OPTIONS:<br>6.1	Aspirating Laser Scanner Fire Alarm System.<br>7.0	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 14 months (426 calendar days) from award date.<br>PLEASE NOTE THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT LISTED BELOW:<br><br> 	The contractor shall participate in monthly Schedule Management Integrated Project Team (SM IPT) and Risk and Opportunity Management (ROM) IPT meetings and actively support meeting activities to promote schedule analysis and integration and risk and opportunity identification and management efforts. <br> 	The contractor shall provide monthly schedule updates to the DCE Program Schedule Manager in coordination with the USACE Project Manager.  Updates shall be posted as complete schedules per cycle established by the SM IPT.<br> 	The contractor shall provide monthly risk and opportunity updates to the DCE Program Risk and Opportunity Manager in coordination with the USACE Project Manager.  Updates will be to mitigation and exploitation plans associated with identified assigned Risks and Opportunities per cycle established by the ROM IPT.<br> 	Occasionally, the contractor shall be requested to add milestones to their schedule (with appropriate schedule logic) to facilitate schedule and risk assessments by the SM IPT and ROM IPT respectively.  These requests will come from the DCE Schedule Manager and/or Risk and Opportunity Manager and be coordinated through the USACE Project Manager. <br> 	Occasionally, the contractor shall be requested to add schedule coding fields to their schedule to facilitate integration and analysis activities by the SM IPT and DCE Schedule Manager.

The collection schedule ensures timely laboratory analysis in keeping with the Detect-to-Treat mission assigned to the Pentagon Force Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Equipment Maintenance: The contractor shall provide equipment and instrument service maintenance agreements and/or calibration services to ensure that all laboratory instruments, equipment, and devices utilized in the testing procedures are covered by a service contract which meets ISO 17025 Standards.  Service contracts on instruments must align with the manufacturer's guidelines so as to ensure quality and/or warranty requirements.</p>
<p>Supplies: The contractor shall provide CBRNE Laboratory with the supplies, reagents and consumable materials (hereafter referred to as supplies) necessary for the laboratory to perform its daily operations.

Toxic liquid and solid materials are removed from the air via a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) grade filter media and gas phase toxins are removed downstream by a bed of ASZM-TEDA activated carbon.  The combination of these two filter mechanisms effectively filters out all known Chemical Biological (CB) warfare agents, toxins and radioactive fallout particles.  The C2A1 canister is used on many mask systems including the M40A1, M42A2, M45, M48, MCU-2A/P, JSAM MPU-5, and JSAM MPU-6 Masks.<br><br><br>

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR&nbsp;QUOTES&nbsp;AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense Dependents Schools - Europe (DoDDS-E) is considering establishing a BPA (on a competitive basis) for various laboratory chemicals (see Attachment A - Chemical Requirement List) to support the Science curriculum at DoDDS-E Middle and High Schools throughout Europe (see Attachment B - DoDDS-E Locations). The orders would most likely be placed by Government Purchase Card holders located at the schools. There have been many issues in the past of getting the chemicals through Customs in the various countries. Therefore, DoDDS-E is seeking interested vendors that have had experience shipping chemicals overseas (specifically to the countries identified in Attachment B).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the DoD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) or GSA E-Buy website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p>Scope: This Sources Sought is for nursing services (RN or LPN) for School Year (SY) 2012-2013 at West Point Elementary School. General dates are mid-August through 31 October 2012 with a break from 1 November 2012 to 31 March 2013.

The disease has progressed thus far to a point where the student can no longer be in an upright position for more than a short duration of 20 minutes. She comes to school in a reclined specially-designed wheelchair.<br />Continuity of care is of the utmost importance. Communication with the school and the home nursing staff must be coordinated prior to start of services.<br />Requested Information:<br />1. Interested vendors<br />2.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Office of Inspector General (OIG) is seeking information to assist with establishing the scope, time frame, cost range, and measurements to be used in a potential, initial review of the EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The OIG is also attempting to identify qualified vendors who would be interested in conducting a review of this program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See the background section for information on the Voting System Testing and Certification program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span>&bull;2.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The EAC was created in 2003 by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>HAVA directed EAC to develop a new set of voting system guidelines or standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EAC has developed the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx">Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> (VVSG) in response to that directive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>HAVA also charged the EAC as first Federal agency responsible for administering a testing and certification program to assess voting equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program followed a program run by a private consortium of election officials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) conducted that testing and certification program until approximately July 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EAC's program was adopted and implemented in January 2007.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The EAC's program has two essential parts:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a laboratory accreditation program and a testing and certification program. Through the laboratory accreditation program, the EAC with the help of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) accredits laboratories that are authorized to test voting systems under the EAC's voting system testing and certification program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The accreditation review includes a technical review by NIST and a conflicts of interest review by the EAC.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The EAC's voting system testing and certification program includes multiple steps. Voting system manufacturers register with EAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those manufacturers then enter into a third-party arrangement with one of EAC's accredited laboratories to conduct testing under the EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Testing is conducted to determine conformance with one of two established sets of voting system standards:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx">2002 Voting System Standards</a> or the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx">2005 Voluntary Voting System Standards. </a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The EAC reviews and approves test plans submitted by the accredited laboratory for each voting system tested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EAC also reviews test reports submitted by the laboratory prior to making a certification decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More detailed information about the EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program is available in the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/manuals_forms_and_notice_of_clarifications.aspx">EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program Manual.</a></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The EAC has certified some voting systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/certified_voting_systems.aspx">Information</a> concerning the certification of these systems is available on EAC's website, <a href="http://www.eac.gov">www.eac.gov</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are <a href="http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/default.aspx">several other systems</a> that are currently undergoing testing and certification review, but which have not received a certification decision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The proposed review would be an initial examination of the EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of the review would be to assess the overall health of the program in terms of its establishment and implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The OIG would ask the vendor to identify the program metrics that have been established by the EAC to collect data points relevant to making a conformance and certification decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The vendor would be asked to analyze those metrics to determine their sufficiency in terms of the EAC's ability to make a sound determination as to whether a voting system conforms to the applicable standards and should or should not be certified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the vendor would be asked to analyze the data collected by the EAC according to its established metrics along with the presence and quality of documentation for those data points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Last, the vendor would be asked to assess whether the review of collected data by EAC through its testing and certification program supports the EAC's certification decisions (both final certification and interim decisions such as test plan approval).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The proposed review would be conducted in accordance with the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quality Standards for Inspections</em> as set forth by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The proposed review would be limited to the Voting System Testing and Certification Program and will not include a review of the Laboratory Accreditation Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted an initial review of this program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GAO issued a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08770.pdf">report</a> concerning that program in September 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed review would also be limited to systems that have been certified or are currently undergoing certification testing and review under the EAC program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This review would be limited to a review of the policies, procedures and practices in place at the EAC for testing and certifying voting systems as well as the documents used to support certification decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those documents would include but are not limited to test plans, test reports, correspondence, notices of clarification, interpretations, notes, and electronic mail that are in the possession of or used by the EAC, its technical reviewers or EAC's accredited laboratories that have performed or will perform tests on subject voting systems.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The proposed review would not involve retesting voting systems that have been processed through the EAC's Voting System Testing and Certification Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vendors would not be asked to conduct field tests of voting equipment that has been issued EAC certification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The review would not include assessments of the capabilities of specific voting systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the vendor would not be asked to visit any of EAC's accredited testing laboratories.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The OIG has limited resources to assign to this task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there will be a preference for cost-effective approaches.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for HIOS 12-8 VHA Anesthesia Record Keeper/Clinical Information System/Intensive Care Unit (ARK, CIS/ICU) Analytics

I.	Introduction:
This sources sought notice is for market research purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. This sources sought notice is a Request for Information (RFI) before the release of any resultant solicitation. This is not a request for a proposal and does not guarantee the release of any solicitation.

II.	Background:

Anesthesia Record Keeper/Clinical Information System/Intensive Care Unit (ARK, CIS/ICU) Analytics is a national initiative of the Deputy Under Secretary for Operations and Maintenance (DUSHOM) for all VISNs (Veterans Integrated Service Networks) to acquire, implement, and sustain CIS and ARKs for all the ICUs and Operating Rooms (ORs) of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). CIS/ARK Analytics is planned for more than 120 ICUs and 140 ORs. The DUSHOM constituted the CIS Support Team (CST) to be responsible for VHA-wide direction and oversight of CIS/ARK Analytics systems, in particular to meet clinical and technical standards of VHA and VA (Department of Veterans Affairs). The CST provides direction in project management and technical guidance to the VISNs;  performs coordination with other organizations in VHA, VA, and outside  vendors;  coordinates review and oversight of implementation, operation, and use. The VISNs implement, test, operate, and use CIS/ARK Analytics systems in their facilities following national direction provided by the CST.

Under direction from the DUSHOM, VISNs acquire CISs and ARKs from commercial vendors. The CISs and ARKs are mandated to meet national VHA standards for data and terminology standards and to use standards interfaces for transmitting data. The VISNs are also mandated to acquire a standard interface for transfer of data with VistA and a standard Medical Analytics system for analysis and reporting of data. The CST coordinates compliance with standards by the vendors that provide system components. For CIS and ARK system, as of December 2011, this involves 6 CIS and ARK vendors, and one vendor each for the data interface and for Medical Analytics. In addition, the CST coordinates national standards for terminology and data within VHA, and coordinates implementation with policies and procedures of VA/OIT (Office of Information Technology). The CST leads VISN participation in maintaining compliance of vendors with standards, in terminology and data standards, and in policies and procedures of OIT.

The CST also coordinates and oversees compliance of the VISNs in acquiring and implementing CIS/ARK Analytics systems. The CST coordinates compliance through standardized processes for acquisition, implementation, test, and approval; and supports compliance through active communications with the VISNs.

In April 2011, the first facility completed implementation and entered production use of a complete, standards-compliant CIS/ARK Analytics system. As of December 2011, 13 facilities in 4 VISNs are in production; and 19 of 21 VISNs, which operate more than 90% of the facilities in VHA, are actively acquiring or implementing a CIS/ARK Analytics system. As of December 2011, 3 standard terminology sets have been released, and 3 additional sets are planned for release in calendar year 2012. Also as of December 2011, systems from one CIS and ARK vendor are in production; and systems from 3 additional vendors are planned to be in production in calendar year 2012.

With CIS/ARK Analytics in production at 13 facilities in 4 VISNs, the ICU/ARK Analytics program has established and put into use program management activities and has overseen actual performance of technical implementation. The CST is now adjusting its activities in carrying its responsibilities forward, through implementation extensions and through functional extensions of its established activities.

The implementation extensions apply the activities that were established with the initial VISNs and facilities to most of 19 VISNs and a majority of facilities of VHA. This includes processes for standardized terminology, and for release and VISN implementation of the ICU/ARK Analytics system. The extensions increase the number of activities that are performed to support the terminology sets, vendors and VISNs/facilities; and to track and oversee all aspects of the program. In addition, the CST has initiated functional extensions to its established activities. These account for VISN and facilities that are actually in production, and include: improvements to systematic tracking, reporting and review of implementations at facilities by VISNs; Analytics integrated with testing and reporting; use of Analytics for reporting at all organizational levels; and coordination and interoperation of ICU/ARK Analytics with other programs.

To support the CST in its responsibilities for coordination and oversight, OHI (Office of Health Information) is the primary provider of technical and administrative support. OHI provides these services through the OHI CIS/ARK Organizational Coordination Group, and additionally through the CIS/ARK Implementation Group.

The primary responsibility of the OHI CIS/ARK Organizational Coordination Group is to assure that CIS/ARK Analytics systems are properly embedded within VHA and VA systems and organizations. This group develops program management and technical topics within the context of VHA strategy and organization; solves problems outside the purview of CIS/ARK Analytics, and oversees and reviews plans and status of ICU/ARK Analytics.

The primary responsibility of the OHI CIS/ARK Implementation Group is direct support to the CST in program management, technical management and communications. This group is to provide properly dedicated attention and resources, as necessary for the detailed, day-to-day activities of management of standardized terminology and data, of coordination among vendors, and of implementation planning and performance of implementation, test and approval; for these and for all aspects of timely, safe, stable and standards-compliant implementation and use of ICU/ARK Analytics at the VISNs. To carry out the primary responsibility to the CST for CIS/ARK Analytics, the CIS/ARK Analytics Implementation Group is complementary to the focus of the OHI CIS/ARK Organizational Coordination Group.

Medium - 26 to 50 attendees (26-50)
Large - 51 to 75 attendees (51-75)

Conference - A prearranged meeting for consultation or exchange of information or discussion (especially one with a formal agenda). 

Retreat - A town hall type meeting for government employees to review progress and challenges in implementing government/departmental policies, engaging their staff in discussing various aspects of said government or departmental activities.  Retreats are often held off site or away from the normal duty station or office.  Such a facility usually offers participants the opportunity to socialize to a greater extent than they otherwise would in the office, and to personalize relationships and gain greater appreciation of each other.

Routine meeting - A formal or informal arranged gathering for a predetermined purpose; in a meeting, two or more people come together for the purpose of discussing a (usually) predetermined topic such as business or community event planning.

Seminar - A lecture or presentation delivered to an audience on a particular topic or set of topics that are educational in nature.  It is usually held for groups of 10-50 individuals.  A seminar is frequently held at a hotel meeting space or within an office conference room. It is also known as a conference.

Symposium - A meeting of a number of experts in a particular field at which papers are presented by specialists on particular subjects and discussed with a view to making recommendations concerning the problems under discussion.

Training - An activity leading to skilled behavior.  Training also refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and information that relate to specific useful competencies.

Workshop - A series of educational and work sessions.  Small groups of people meet together over a short period of time to concentrate on a defined area of concern.  Purposes for workshops may vary; examples include Informing, Problem solving, and Training.  Typically a workshop has two components:  technical in which one presents theory in lectures and readings, and in which one would do a project, produce a product, or write a paper.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Study to Establish Timing of the reversal of coagulopathy following hemorrhagic shock using small volume 7.5% NaCl with Adenocaine Mg2+
<SOLNBR>N3239812DOBSON
<ARCHDATE>05022012
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Hibernation Therapeutics Pty Ltd; Queensland, Australia 4811, for the collaborative study with Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), to establish the timing of the correction of coagulopathy using small volume 7.5% NaCl with Adenocaine Mg2+ following severe blood loss in the robust preclinical rat model of hemorrhagic shock.  

A mechanistic study using the ROTEM and multiplate Platelet functional analysis will be performed in a rat model of severe hemorrhagic shock which may have important battlefield and clinical applications. Studies will include plasma aPTT and PT clotting times, and whole blood ROTEM clotting and platelet functions.
  These studies will be conducted concurrently to test different, potentially effective small volume resuscitation strategies to not only raise mean arterial pressure into the permissive range but to correct the hypocoagulopathy that occurs accompanying shock and blood loss.  A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of acute coagulopathy along with small volume resuscitation has far reaching practical battlefield applications and may fill an urgent military capability gap.  Additionally, evaluation and characterization of the clotting mechanisms in the robust rat model of hemorrhagic shock will provide essential baseline data for translation into larger battlefield relevant models and human safety trials.
   The estimated value of the contract is $200,000.00.  

HT demonstrates a unique and innovative concept and a unique capability of the source to provide the particular research services proposed, as no other vendors are capable of performing this work due to the patent and proprietary nature of the medication used in the study.  Based on these unique capabilities and the previous research accomplished, HT is the only institution capable of meeting the Governments requirements. 

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability.
  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

All capability statements received by 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 1 MAY 2012 will be considered by the Government.   Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG) intends to negotiate and award on a non-competitive basis a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR subpart 13.5 to Microsoft for professional services identified herein.
<p>Background: FHFA OIG was recently established by law to provide independent and objective reporting to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). FHFA OIG's mission is to promote the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of FHFA's programs; to assist FHFA in the performance of its mission; to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in FHFA's programs; and to seek sanctions and prosecutions against those who are responsible for such fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>
<p>As part of this, it is vitally important that they run independent of the main FHFA infrastructure as quickly as possible. FHFA OIG has completed Phase I, finalizing Phase II of Microsoft Office 365 Cloud solution based upon the latest versions of Microsoft Technologies (Exchange 2010, SharePoint 2010 and Lync). Phase III requires additional architecture and engineering services in support of the final construction and deployment of its new cloud information technology network infrastructure and systems. This cloud technology is so new and advanced that only Microsoft is capable to perform Phase III support services. These services are contingent for FHFA OIG to run independently from FHFA.</p>
<p>Phase III must begin immediately and the cloud knowledge and skill sets that the Microsoft engineers have by working in the FHFA OIG infrastructure will enable the implementation to proceed without delay.</p>
<p>No solicitation document is available. BPD will consider all affirmative responses received no later than April 23, 2012. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to make a sole-source award to Microsoft. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Electronic submission, in response to this notice, shall reference SS-FHG-12-074 in the subject field and emailed to the attention of psb1@bpd.treas.gov. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00pm ET, April 23, 2012.</p>
<p>Late responses will not be accepted or evaluated.<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS: No solicitation document is available.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source contract to SAP PUBLIC SERVICES, INC., located at 1300 PENNSYLVANIA AVE STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20004-3012.
<p>The CDC has procured a world class Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in support of the public sector vaccine management activities with a system called Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) in order to replace aging legacy systems. SAP is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) integrated application utilizing commercial industry best practices to create efficiencies and to bring more visibility and transparency to vaccine management. CDC maintains security policies across the CDC infrastructure requiring that only cleared and approved staff is granted access to CDC systems for the provision of COTS software maintenance and support services. In order to support such special security requirements in its customer base, SAP Government Support Services (GSS) was formed by SAP to provide a Secure Maintenance program that bridges gaps between SAP's standard support and public sector customers' specific security requirements. SAP GSS provides this support from a controlled facility where the secure connection terminates and will enable CDC to fully leverage SAP experience and expertise while maintaining a secure interface to the SAP global support and development environments. Additionally, SAP GSS staff and facilities are cleared at a secret level and above. Cleared US citizen support is unavailable through SAP's standard maintenance support, and therefore the CDC security requirements can only be met through SAP Secure Enterprise Support, and SAP GSS is the sole provider of these services.</p>
<p>The contract will provide annual maintenance renewal, in support of VTrckS from SAP GSS. The acquisition will combine four current contracts for Enterprise Secure Support, SAP software subscriptions and licenses: 200-2012-42414, 200-2012-409955, M-41745 and 200-2012-40452. All of these current contracts are expiring on August 2012. <br /><br />SAP GSS is the sole provider of SAP Secure Enterprise Support renewals, and has not authorized any reseller or channel partner to sell the SAP Secure Enterprise Support renewals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Potential offerors that can provide the above service shall give written notification to the Contracting Officer not later than April 30, 2012, 2:00 p.m. Responses may be sent via email to tdc0@cdc.gov or to the address shown above. No solicitation will be issued. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Title of Procurement: Re- Racking and Decommissioning Plan Modification to existing Contract HSBP1010C00056
<p>Type of Notice: Special Notice-Notice of Intent to Sole Source</p>
<p>Procurement Office: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Tactical Communications (TACCOM) Branch, Wireless Systems Program Office (WSPO)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Wireless System Program Office (WSPO) Tactical Communications (TACCOM) Branch intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Motorola for Decommissioning Plans and Re-racking services. It has been determined through market research that Motorola is the only firm capable of satisfying the Government's requirement with respect to ensuring the current implementation of the project schedule and maintaining the current warranty on LMR equipment.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Decommissioning Plans for 3 sites - In order to proceed with planned site development activities at Coburn Mtn, Norway Bluff, and West Kennebago, CBP must remove existing infrastructure in order to secure a lease for the site. In some cases their may be existing LMR communications equipment that must be moved to temporary structures to continue existing service. The Decommissioning Plans are needed to identify the scope of the efforts to remove infrastructure while maintaining continuing service until cutover of the modernized equipment and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Re-racking services for 28 sites - Per CBP direction, Motorola installed LMR equipment in open racks during the staging phase which took place in summer of 2011. Due to the need to meet physical security requirements at sites which allow non-CBP personnel, it is necessary to remove the LMR equipment that was installed in open racks for 28 of the 62 sites during LMR staging process and re-install the equipment in 55 secure cabinets which is already being furnished as CLIN 1400 of the contract.</p>

<SUBJECT>58--Sole source - Radio fish transmitters
<SOLNBR>F12PS00335
<CONTACT>Amanda Jordan

<a href="mailto:amanda_jordan@fws.gov">amanda_jordan@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Lotek Wireless, Inc.  The Service has a continued requirement for telemetry study of fish in the Kuparuk River.
One hundred and ten radio transmitters are required to conduct a research project investigating Arctic Grayling movement in the Kuparuk River, and ten will be implanted on a small headwater lake on the Oksrukuyik Creek, a nearby stream that is a tributary to the larger Sagavanirktok River.  Arctic grayling is a small fish species approximately 30 to 50 cm in length, and transmitters must be surgically implanted to achieve our objective.  Transmitters must, therefore, be very small, no more than 1cm I diameter and 2.5 cm in length.
Radio transmitters are routinely procured as sole source in part because if new receivers had to be purchased every time we conducted a new telemetry project (at $4000 to $8000 per receiver) they would be prohibitively expensive to conduct, and in part because they different telemetry producers specialize in different applications.  The transmitters requested here will be compatible with the existing network of remote receiving stations and they meet the size, operational life, and electronic programming criterion described.
Work description:Provide 110 microprocessor coded radio fish     This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.

THE TECHNOLOGY: Actuators and transducers are deployed to harvest mechanical energy in the environment aselectrical energy and to convert stored electrical energy into mechanical energy. Bydevelopinga transducer based on advanced electroactive materials, NASA has produced a design thatcan harvest orders of magnitude more energy in a given application than traditionalsolutions, yielding more power to drive devices and store in batteries. In acomplementary effort, a hybrid actuator system (HYBAS) with both an electroactive polymer(EAP) and an electroactiveceramic (EAC) achieves enhanced displacement performance from a single power supply,greatly reducing electrical consumption while simultaneously improving mechanicaldisplacement compared to current state-of-the-art actuators.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed an enhanced crimp tool that provides real-timeverification of wire-crimp integrity while the crimp is being formed. The toolnondestructively tests crimp connection quality in aircraft and other critical wiringsystems. Modern commercial aircraft rely on thousands of crimped wire terminations forcritical communication, navigation, control, and electrical power distribution systems.Wiring crimp failures can be a threat to aircraft safety and may lead to a loss ofcritical functions or an onboard fire. In addition to the safety concerns, diagnosing andrepairing poor crimp connections is costly. By enabling an efficient way to directly testall crimps as they are made, the new tool improves quality control and reduces the risksof failure.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative NAVAIR Workshop<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative (DeVenCI) will conduct a workshop in the China Lake, CA area in July / August, 2012 to help discover emerging technologies relevant to the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The workshop will provide selected innovative companies who do not normally conduct business with the DoD with an opportunity to make short presentations to government representatives about their technologies and products. <br /><br />NAVAIR is looking for emerging technology products in the areas listed below to help improve their operational capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp; - Advanced Materials<br />&nbsp; - Energy <br />&nbsp; - Sensors<br />&nbsp; - Imagery<br />&nbsp; - Data<br />&nbsp; - Advanced Communications Infrastructure<br /><br />Specific needs are contained in the attached file: NAVAIR Needs Statement.pdf.<br /><br />DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity whose dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI uses workshops to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It provides timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses. Instead, it focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed adoption of emerging technology solutions to meet DoD user needs.<br /><br />Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. <strong>All applications must be received on or before April 30th, 2012.</strong> Selected companies will be responsible for their travel and all other expenses associated with participation in this workshop which will be held in July / August 2012 in China Lake, CA.</p>

<ARCHDATE>04232012
<CONTACT>Lisa Wells, 301-619-2086

<a href="mailto:lisa.lynn.wells@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price award modification on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1).  Modification will be issued to the existing contract with the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), P.O. Box 10008, Rockville, MD  20849.  Modification is for continued professional support services to the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM), U.S. Army Garrison-Forest Glen, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  The proposed modification will add 5 months to an initial 3 months of support services to NMHM.  The total contract duration for ARP services will become 8 months ending in May 2012.  The modification will bridge the existing contract to a planned competitive award for a base plus option years.  ARP, by virtue of being the incumbent contractor, is the only responsible source for the bridge modification to extend the current contract. The execution of the bridge modification will prevent any potential adverse impact to the mission of the NMHM, which would occur in the event of interruption or disruption of the work presently being performed. <br><br>The modification requirement is for non-personal services to be extended on ARP's contract W81XWH-11-C-0495.  The initial contract was issued to bridge professional and administrative support to NMHM on a sole source basis through December 31, 2011.  The additional support to be provided via award modification is required to continue adequate professional and administrative museum-unique staffing to support the NMHM at an acceptable operational level.  As transition operations continue from the mandated Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) project, ARP staff and expertise is required to continue from, or complete, projects that are underway.   The modification value is $786,633.39 with an award value of $1,327,007.17 over the entire 8 month period.  <br><br>The incumbent ARP provides highly trained museum support staff to NMHM.  To attempt to do a stop-gap short-term competitive contract to cover the requirements pending the award of follow-on contract is not feasible because the three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span 5 months would potentially disrupt the acceptable operational level of support required to carry out the mission of the NMHM.  The statement of work under the bridge modification is to remain substantially the same as under the current ARP contract. <br><br>This is a notice of intent to award a bridge modification under the current contract and is not a request for quotes or proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than December 28, 2011 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time to Ms. Tonya Kreps, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at tonya.kreps@amedd.army.mil.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder mission objectives of the NMHM Program Management Office.<br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any bridge modifications to the existing contract. Any questions or concerns with regard to the Government's intent to sole source this bridge modification shall sent by email to tonya.kreps@amedd.army.mil, no later than December 28, 2011 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.  <br><br>This document sets forth the justification and approval for an exception to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and FAR 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Execution of the bridge modification will prevent any adverse impact to the mission of the NMHM, which would occur with the interruption/disruption of the work presently performed.  <br><br>The support services provided under this modification and the initial award have been performed by ARP for the past 15 years, primarily through cost reimbursement type contracts under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) and 10 U.S.C. 176(b)(1)(C), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  The authority expired in September 2011 due to the disestablishment of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Law 2005 directed the relocation of NMHM from Walter Reed to Forest Glen Annex, Silver Spring, MD.  Therefore, the requirement for ARP to provide its expertise and support services to the Army remains, only in a reduced capacity until a long term competitive award is issued.  A new award is planned for late spring/early summer 2012.<br>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate an extension of services to a firm-fixed-price award on a sole source basis.  A modification to extend support services to the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM), U.S. Army Garrison-Forest Glen, Silver Spring, MD, performed under contract # W81XWH-11-C-0495,  will be processed using the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  <br><br>The referenced contract is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2012 and an extension is required to temporarily bridge services until a competitive contract is awarded in summer 2012.  Services are being performed by the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), P.O. Box 10008, Rockville, MD.  The proposed modification will increase the performance period by 2 months, and include and an option for an additional month of service.  The total contract duration for ARP services under the contract will be up to 10 months, ending July 31, 2012, excluding the option.  ARP, as the performing contractor, is the only responsible source for the bridge modification to prevent potential adverse impact to the mission of the NMHM.  <br><br>The modification requirement is for non-personal services to be extended on ARP's contract W81XWH-11-C-0495. The initial contract was issued to bridge professional and administrative support to NMHM on a sole source basis through May 31, 2012. The additional support to be provided via award modification is required to continue adequate professional and administrative museum-unique staffing to support the NMHM at an acceptable operational level. As transition operations continue from the mandated Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) project, ARP staff and expertise is required to continue from, or complete, projects that are underway. The modification value is $336,600.00 with an award value of $1,663,607.17 over the entire 10 month period. <br><br>The incumbent ARP provides highly trained museum support staff to NMHM. To attempt a short-term competitive contract to cover required services, pending a replacement award is not feasible.  The three-tiered transition (from incumbent to short-term contractor to follow-on contractor) within a span 2-3 months would potentially disrupt the acceptable operational level of support required to carry out the mission of the NMHM. The statement of work under the bridge modification is to remain substantially the same as under the current ARP contract. <br><br>This is a notice of intent to award a bridge modification under the current contract and is not a request for proposal, no solicitation is forthcoming.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the Government to award a bridge modification to the existing contract.  <br><br>Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than May 4, 2012 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time to Mr. Scot Plank, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at scot.b.plank@amedd.army.mil. Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder mission objectives of the NMHM Program Management Office.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.<br>

The Charleston VA Medical Centers current interventional radiology procedures requires a broad stock of expendable supplies that are very costly to maintain, require labor intensive inventory and maintenance procedures and have in the past expired before use. Establishment of a consignment agreement with Cook Medical Inc., the current provider of these supplies, can provide the supplies without financial risk to RHJVAMC due to expiration and provide the flexibility to expand or collapse the program as demand dictates.

<p><br />2010 Mexican Spotted Owl Territory Monitoring<br />Magdalena Ranger District<br />Cibola National Forest</p>
<p>SECTION C-DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>C.1 OBJECTIVE OF MONITORING CONTRACT</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, supplies, transportation, equipment and materials (except for Government furnished property) needed to conduct formal monitoring of sixteen known Mexican spotted owl (MSO) Protected Activity Centers (PACs) in the San Mateo and Magdalena Mountains of central New Mexico. All monitoring will be done according to established protocol to determine presence/absence and reproductive success.</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit completed forms, maps, digital images and a final report of all findings.</p>
<p>LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF MSO TERRITORIES</p>
<p><br />MAGDALENA MSO Protected Activity Centers (PACs)</p>
<p><br />PAC 030301 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Access is DIFFICULT with total hike distance of 8.1 miles, covering 2,600 ft elevation change.</p>
<p>PAC 030302 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Access is DIFFICULT with total hike distance for this PAC 6.25 miles covering 3600 ft elevation change.</p>
<p>PAC 030303 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Access is MODERATE with hike of 7.75 miles covering 2800 ft elevation change.</p>
<p>PAC 030304 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Access is DIFFICULT with hike totaling 8 miles round trip from the trailhead covering 4000 ft elevation change. The total time for this hike is estimated 8-10 hours. This hike should be considered DIFFICULT.</p>
<p>PAC 030307 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Hike covering 1800 ft elevation change and takes a minimum of 4 hours. This hike should be considered MODERATE and could be completed in conjunction with PAC (030303) and PAC(030302).</p>
<p>PAC 030308 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Total round-trip distance for this hike is an estimated 7 miles, including hiking within the length of the PAC and will take an estimated 4 hours. This hike should be considered EASY.</p>
<p>*PAC 030312 (West Magdalena Mtns) Access is easy, estimated 4.5 miles.<br />*PAC 030313 (East Magdalena Mtns.) Access is difficult.</p>
<p>PAC 030314 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Access is estimated at 4.4 miles to PAC. The drive to the Trailhead is about 2.5 hours. This hike could be completed in conjunction with PAC (030304). Total distance for the survey of these two PACs is 9 miles, covering 5200 ft elevation change and will take an estimated 8-10 hours. This hike should be considered DIFFICULT. Access is difficult.</p>
<p>PAC 030316 (North San Mateo Mtns.) Total hike distance within this PAC is estimated 3.8 miles and covers 3600 ft. elevation change. This hike should be considered MODERATE due to high elevation and the extensive elevation change experienced from the top of the PAC to the bottom.</p>
<p>*PAC 030317 (Central Magdalena Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road to trail XX, estimated 0.4 miles to PAC. Access is moderate.</p>
<p>*PAC 030318 (Central Magdalena Mtns.) Road Access from Forest Road to Trail XX to PAC. Access is easy.</p>
<p>PAC 030321 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road to Trail XX estimated 0.7 miles to PAC. The last leg of the drive follows FR XXX for approximately 20 miles and the road may be in deteriorated condition from the 10-mile mark to Trail XX. There may be several places where washouts make traversing steep-sloped drainages difficult. The total drive time from Magdalena is approximately 4.5 hours. Access for this PAC is DIFFICULT. From Trail XX trailhead, hike northeast approximately 0.75 mile to the canyon bottom and the PAC boundary. Total round trip travel for this PAC is 4 miles with a total elevation change of 1200 ft. The hike takes estimated 3 hours and should be considered EASY with regards to hiking difficulty.</p>
<p>PAC 030322 (South San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road XX, to Trail XX, east approximately 3.0 miles to PAC. The survey of this PAC will cover 7 miles over 2000 ft elevation change and take an estimated 4-5 hours. This survey should be considered MODERATE to difficulty with vehicle access issues being the most problematic of all PACs surveyed.</p>
<p>PAC 030324 (North San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road XX to PAC. Accessing the PAC from Trail XX and FR XX is a one-mile hike to the bottom of the PAC that covers a 1300 ft elevation drop. Accessing the PAC from Trail XX is about 0.9 miles with a 1000ft elevation drop. Either route takes an estimated 2 hours. Access for this PAC should be considered EASY but the elevation of the routes can complicate this survey for less experienced surveyors.</p>
<p>PAC 030325 (North San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road XX, to Trail XX, estimated 2.0 miles to PAC. This PAC can be accessed from east or west. From the east, follow the above directions to Trail XX then follow Trail XX approximately 2.5 miles, climbing 600 ft in elevation to the PAC boundary. Follow Trail XX along Canyon bottom to the junction of Trail XX and Trail XX and continue on Trail XX for approximately 1 mile (from the junction). The southern end of the PAC sits at about 8000' in elevation for a total of 1200 ft elevation gain from the start of the hike. This hike is approximately 7 miles in length with 2400 ft elevation change and will take estimated 4.5 hours to complete. This hike should be considered MODERATE in difficulty. From the west side, follow the instructions for PAC (030308) and continue past the east boundary to the Trail XX junction. Take Trail XX north 1.5 miles over the adjacent pass into Canyon climbing and descending a total of 800 ft from the Trail XX junction. Although this route is somewhat shorter than the east entrance route, the elevation change along this route is much greater with a total change of 4000 ft. This route will take an estimated 5 hours to complete and should be considered DIFFICULT due to elevation change and elevation at start of route but is could be preferred because of the drive time to get to the eastern route start point.</p>
<p>PAC 030326 (North San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Forest Road XX approximately 1.3 miles to PAC. From the center of the PAC, each side-drainage is easily accessed for daytime pre-calling surveys. This daytime calling route is estimated 3.3 miles round trip and covers 2400 ft elevation change through dense vegetation and closed canopy mixed conifer forest. This route was used for daytime pre-calling and nighttime surveys and considering the terrain and undergrowth, should be considered MODERATE during pre-calling daytime surveys and DIFFICULT for nighttime hiking.</p>
<p>*New PACs for this contract (not previously contracted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.3 WORK DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended, but not necessary. Conditions of track roads can be poor when wet. Some of the access roads can be rough. Some of the survey routes are in designated Wilderness. Motorized or wheeled vehicle are not allowed in Wilderness so surveys would be conducted on foot or by horseback.</p>
<p>The 2012 weather is forecast for warm temperatures and continued dry conditions. The entire Cibola National Forest has been under Fire Restrictions in the past and fire restrictions are expected this year. When in fire restriction, campfires, charcoal grills and stove fires are prohibited on national forest lands except in developed camp and picnic grounds where grills were provided. Smoking was allowed within an enclosed vehicle or building; a developed recreation site; or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter and free of all flammable material. If dry conditions continue, the District may be under a total closure again during the 2012 MSO monitoring season. In that case, the contractor may be given specific written permission to continue survey work during the closure.</p>
<p>Mexican spotted owl Monitoring</p>
<p>MSO monitoring may be performed beginning as soon as the contract is awarded and will be completed by August 31, 2012. Upon completion of the field survey, the Contractor shall have 31 calendar days to deliver the Final Report to the COR.</p>
<p>Informal monitoring and/or pre-calling daytime visits will be conducted at known nest sites within MSO PACs during dates established in the MSO survey protocol included in this package. If MSO are located during informal and/or pre-calling visits, no further visits or reproductive success visits would need to be done thereafter, although nest status should be documented if a nest is located.</p>
<p>If MSO are not located during daytime visits, formal MSO monitoring shall be performed according to the MSO survey protocol attached to this contract package, or until an individual or MSO pair responds (up to four complete surveys including an optional daytime visit). Only the actual PAC areas need formal monitoring.</p>
<p>Any location marking method, such as flagging or Brite Eyes, may be used to mark calling routes or routes to nest/roost locations. All markers placed during this contract must be removed at the conclusion of the contract. GPS locations will be taken for each route and placed on the standard topographic maps described above.</p>
<p>If a MSO flies or appears to be located on private land, no attempts will be made to cross ownership boundaries. Contractor will show direction of flight on a map included in the final report, or estimate the location of the area a MSO appears to be located in.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to assure all persons conducting the monitoring work meet training and certification requirements. Proof of training and required Region 3 certification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer's Representative prior to award, for crew leaders and preferably all crewmembers. (Crewmembers certified after award of contract must show certification prior to initiation of fieldwork).</p>
<p>Monitoring information shall be documented on the MSO survey forms (attached).</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine local conditions affecting road access to each site. Notify the COR within 2 working days if weather caused road inaccessibility (on an open road) is delaying work.</p>
<p><br />C.4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>All required forms (inventory, optional daytime follow-up, etc) shall be completed in accordance with the protocol/guideline requirements and shall be submitted in accordance with the specifications in C and as part of the Deliverables, as specified in C.</p>

The prices provided for each of the CLINS above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center's (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with the Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The Contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the format using the following web address: https://cmra.army.mil. The required information includes: (1) Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; (2) Contract number, including task and delivery order number; (3) Beginning and ending dates covered by reporting period; (4) Contractor name, address, phone number, e-mail address, identity of Contractor employee entering data; (5) Estimated direct labor hours (including sub-Contractors); (6) Estimated direct labor dollars paid this reporting period (including sub-Contractors); (7) Total payments (including sub-Contractors); (8) Predominant Federal Service Code (FSC) reflecting services provided by Contractor (and separate predominant FSC for each sub-Contractor if different); (9) Estimated data collection costs; (10) Organizational title associated with the Unit Identification Code (UIC) for the Army Requiring Activity (the Army Requiring Activity is responsible for providing the Contractor with its UIC for the purposes of reporting this information); (11) Locations where Contractor and sub-Contractors perform the work (specified by zip code in the United States and nearest city, country, when in an overseas location, using standardized nomenclature provided on website); (12) Presence of deployment or contingency contract language; and (13) Number of contractor and sub-contractor employees deployed in theater this reporting period (by country). As part of its submission, the Contractor will also provide the estimated total cost (if any) incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.  Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 September of each government fiscal year and must be reported by 31 October of each calendar year.   Contractors may use a direct XML data transfer to the database server or fill in the fields on the website. The XML direct transfer is a format for transferring files from a contractor's systems to the secure website without the need for separate data entries for each required data element at the website. The specific formats for the XML direct transfer may be downloaded from the website. The CMRA web site maintains a "Frequently Asked Questions and Answers" https://cmra.army.mil/ that is updated periodically.  Any technical or implementation questions not addressed on this site can be discussed and coordinated through the CMR Help Desk at 703-377-6199, or https://cmra.army.mil. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first.

<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334515 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) High-speed Realtime Oscilloscope and Differential Probe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, and equipment to fabricate and deliver a High-speed Realtime Oscilloscope and Differential Probe.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Ongoing research in single-photon detectors requires a high-speed real-time oscilloscope and differential probe for the development of advanced systems. Our application requires a real-time oscilloscope with at least a 20-GHz bandwidth. In addition, there is a critical requirement for a low noise floor, as this allows detection of small and fast signals; the noise floor on a 50-mV/div scale must be less than 2-mV RMS over the entire 20-GHz bandwidth (or, as often alternatively specified, the %-full-scale noise (%FS) must be less than 0.5% at 50 mV/div). An additional requirement is the ability to upgrade the oscilloscope to a higher bandwidth (30 GHz) while maintaining the noise floor below 2.5-mV RMS (&lt; 0.625 %FS) over the entire 30 GHz range.</p>
<p>The signals involved in this research vary significantly in amplitude, with the smallest signals occurring among significantly larger ones. For this reason we require an oscilloscope with at least +/- 5 Volts input voltage range at all full-scale (FS) settings (particularly below 100 mV/div.). To identify small signals among larger ones it is necessary that the oscilloscope have versatile triggering capabilities: it must be possible to define trigger conditions based on measurements or graphically-defined regions.</p>
<p>Finally, we require an active differential probe with bandwidth at least 6 GHz that is compatible with the oscilloscope.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) High-speed Realtime Oscilloscope, which shall meet or exceed the specifications identified below.</p>
<p>1.) Bandwidth: 20 GHz, upgradable up to &gt;30 GHz.</p>
<p>2.) Sample rate: 80 gigaSamples per second on 2 channels, 40 gigaSamples per second on four channels</p>
<p>3.) Maximum input voltage: +/- 5 Volts at all vertical-scale settings.<br /><br />4.) Noise floor: &lt;2 mV RMS at 50 mV/div. over the entire 20-GHz bandwidth, or alternatively, &lt;0.5% FS at 50mV/div, over the entire 20-GHz bandwidth.</p>
<p>5.) Jitter measurement floor: &lt;200 fs RMS</p>
<p>6.) Waveform memory: 40 Mpts/ch for two channels, 20 Mpts/ch for four channels, upgradeable to 1 Gpts/ch.</p>
<p>7.) Measurement-defined triggering, or alternatively, "zone-qualify triggering," "Measurement trigger," or equivalent triggering functionality.</p>
<p>8.) Active differential probe compatible with the oscilloscope: bandwidth 6 GHz or greater.</p>
<p>Express Warranty</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide a standard commercial warranty.</p>
<p>Delivery</p>
<p>FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place in accordance with Contractor's commercial schedule. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>

The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above.

<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award.

<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Justin Haynes<br />TEL: 01638-52-2344 or EM: justin.haynes@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

Response: 1) No. Please read the attchmnt. Once the BPA is established, the gvnmnt can place an order(s), as needed. The items listed here are provided as a "sampling" of supplies ordered as a basis for price & technical acceptability purposes only. It is not possible at this time to provide a complete list of other items due to that being unknown until a supply rqmnt is identified. Thus, the reason chosen for the "sampling." Please price as a qty of 1, with the knowledge that this base price is the determinant for evaluation/basis for award, and ultimately, for future qty orders. 2) No. This is not possible in this circumstance. A PO will be issued, with a level of funding, to enable quick orders to be placed, rcvd, accepted, an invc submitted, and pymnt rendered against the funding doc. 3) All companies shall indicate TAA-compliance. As this is a law that the gvnmnt can only purchase U.S.-made or designated country end products, companies are considered TAA-compliant if they follow TAA guidelines. That said, contractors shall indicate TAA-compliancy in their response in order to be considered under this solicitation.<BR><BR>Q#1: SOW states send quotes via email, but FedBid Terms state to send quote on their site. Ans#1: Ensure FedBid Terms are met by posting quote on its site. Email to CO as well, along with any other info req'd. Q#2: If items on BOM are not TAA Compliant, possible that Govt would still purchase? Ans#2: As applicable, if BOM include item(s) that fall under TAA-Compliancy guidelines, then the purchase is allowable. As previously stated, TAA Compliance is a law that stipulates that the govmnt can only purchase U.S.-made or designated country end products. If the item comes from a country other than who is under the TAA law, the govmnt can not purchase it.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The following additional requirements are being added to the technical specifications for the Controller and Hand Held Remote:<br /><br />The controller enclosure should have two easily accessible switches (i.e. mounted on the front panel) that allow the user to individually disable one of the axes. NIST would like this implemented using two switches (one for each axis). When the switches are in the ON position, the axis can be moved using the hand held remote or computer control. When the switch is in the OFF position, it is not possible to move the specific axis using the hand held remote or computer control. These switches will allow NIST to "lock out" or disable an axis to prevent accidentally moving it after it has been aligned into a specific position.

<p><br />SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Facilities Management Office, in the Office of the Administration, oversees the maintenance and space allocations within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) buildings, and also serves as a liaison with the General Services Administration (GSA) and other supporting entities on and around the White House complex. In order to conduct its mission, EOP's Facilities Management Office procures parking management services at the New Executive Office Building (NEOB) in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />The Contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment, supplies and supervision necessary and shall plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective and economical completion of all services described herein. The Contractor shall provide parking management services in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation at the New Executive Office Building (NEOB) in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TASKS<br />The Contractor shall ensure only authorized individuals park in the NEOB facility. The Contractor shall also ensure that the vehicles display an appropriate EOP parking permit and current validation sticker. The Government issues new validation stickers each month to approved parking permit holders.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all materials (except parking permits), supplies and equipment, as well as properly trained labor and supervision to furnish parking management and operations services. The Government will determine parking eligibility and furnish the physical parking permits.</p>
<p>The presence of at least one attendant is required during garage operating hours (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays).</p>
<p>Attendant/s will check vehicles in and out of the facility, and control unauthorized use of the facility.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop written procedures for the resolution of claims for injury or damage, and distribute those procedures to all the individuals using the parking facilities, the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain the parking facility, including, but not limited to, picking up and removing all materials, paper, trash and discarded materials. In addition, the Contractor shall maintain the parking facility in a safe and clean manner.</p>
<p>Some of the parking spaces in the NEOB are narrow and multiple vehicles deep. The Contractor shall provide parking assistance and space optimization services to effectively utilize all parking spaces. The Contractor shall initially park and/or relocate vehicles to accomplish this task. Government employees authorized to park at the NEOB will notify the Contractor if they expect to leave before their normal departure time and will request direction to a space with free access.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that vehicles are not subject to vandalism. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that vehicles are not subject to movement, and/or removal, except by authorized persons.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall minimize any movement or disruption of the personal settings, internal and external for each vehicle (to include seat and mirror settings). If the need arises, the Contractor must ensure that the settings are returned to the original location.</p>
<p>In an emergency, the operator of an obstructed vehicle will ascertain the permit number of the blocking vehicle and notify the attendant. The attendant will contact the COR and/or the owner of the blocking vehicle, and request movement within 15 minutes</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT AND GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Government will provide distinctive parking permits monthly to identify the parking areas, month of issuance and contractor's name. Each month will have a different color coding from the preceding month and will have the employee's name and Division. The permits will be numbered to coincide with the numbering system on the list of approved individuals to park.</p>
<p>The Government issues new validation stickers each month to approximately 186 approved parking permit holders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #1f497d">Background information:</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #1f497d">There are 2 RHEEM AC units mounted directly to a concrete pad outside of building #66. There is a lean-to roof built over the top of the units to prevent snow, water and ice from falling on top of the units. The problem seems to be in the fall, when water is collected around the bottom of the units and then freezes solid damaging the bottom ring of coils inside the AC units. These units were purchased and installed in 2004 when R22 coolant was readily available. Now R22 has been replaced with a more friendly coolant but the existing units are not compatible with the new coolant. Estimates I have are around 8 to 10 k to replace the entire system. You know as well as me what the answer was when I shared the problems with our Research Leader. We use this lab year around so we must have a reliable cooling and heating source. The solution is to replace the damaged coil and then raise both units to avoid the water collection problem. I believe the units can be raised by using lifts between the units frame and the concrete pad, allowing water to pass under the units.</span></p>

<DESC>Response is provided to the following questions received in regard to Roads Construction Project FAIR 1(3):

QUESTION 1:  On sheet 22 of 57 of the drawings, note 4 states the following: Apply penetrating water repellant treatment to all exposed surfaces of the barrier railing.  See finishing concrete note on bridge notes and design data sheet.  There is also reference in the specifications to a type 6 (color) finish; however, no color or specific product guidelines are provided.  Please advise.
RESPONSE:  Contractors should be familiar with different types of water repellants and concrete sealants.  There are many brands to choose from.  The color will be selected after submittal of a color pallet.  This also is something that an experienced Contractor will know how and where to obtain this product. 


QUESTION 2:  On sheet 23 of 57 of the drawings, note 2 states that:  The color of the vinyl coating shall be as specified by the C.O.  Is it possible to provide a baseline reference for this color for bidding purposes?
RESPONSE:  The Government will select the color after a color pallet has been submitted for approval.  The Contractor needs to bid on what his supplier quotes him for all different colors.  Color preference is for brown or redwood.


QUESTION 3:  Could you please clarify how many layers of A-Jacks are required for the subject matter project? Sheet 27b of the documents does not give that information.
RESPONSE:  The A-jacks are one layer at 24 inches units.


QUESTION 4:  Under I.76, 52.236-01 Performance of Work by the Contractor states "The contractor shall perform on the site and with its own organization fifteen (15%) percent of the total amount of work to be performed under the contract."  Question:  Is the government going to enforce this regulation for this contract?
RESPONSE:  FAR Clause 52.236-01 is provided in its entirety as follows:  "Performance of Work by the Contractor (Apr 1984).  The Contractor shall perform on the site, and with its own organization, work equivalent to at least  Fifteen (15%)   percent of the total amount of work to be performed under the contract. This percentage may be reduced by a supplemental agreement to this contract if, during performing the work, the Contractor requests a reduction and the Contracting Officer determines that the reduction would be to the advantage of the Government."
Yes  -  the Government shall enforce the FAR 52.236-01.  The Prime will reflect in their Subcontracting Plan how they intend to perform 15% of the work.
Amendment No. 2 will be issued and posted on fbo.gov this date to add FAR Clause 52.219-9 Small Business Subcontracting Plan to Solicitation document No. A12PS00522  -  which is the base clause for the ALT 1 Clause which currently is in the solicitation document.

<DESC>This is modification #3 to the synopsis entitled Engineering Fabrication Services(EFS), NNJ12414076L, which was posted on November 8, 2011.NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizationalconflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Engineering Fabrication Services (EFS)procurement.The nature of the work anticipated under EFS may create a situation where there could bethe potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each potential offerorshould review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and considercarefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete forEFS. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under EFS will include the following typesof tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive. 	Assessment of designs from the EFS contractors own organization for design formanufacturability.	Acceptance of final product when the inspector and the receiving organization arethe same.

The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.

The current design backload contains multiple small and medium size projects that vary widely in nature. It is not the intent of this contract to design major Military Construction Program projects.<br /><br />EVALUATION: The Governments selection of the best value contractor is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s). Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. <br />FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services) evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team. Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team. The key positions should include: Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors. Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES. <br />FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s). Particularly work on National Guard projects and Army or Air Force projects.<br />FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years) evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules. <br />FACTOR 4 -Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time) evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods. <br />FACTOR 5- Firm Location &amp; Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to Hartford, CT and knowledge of this locality) evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from Hartford, CT and the extent of the firms knowledge of Connecticut and knowledge/experience concerning state, and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract. <br />FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months) in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement. <br />FACTOR 7- Small Business Participation evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner. <br />FACTORS 1 &amp; 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, more important than FACTOR 3, 4 &amp; 5 which are each weighted equal. FACTORS 1 &amp; 2 are also significantly more important than FACTORS 6 &amp; 7 which are weighted equal and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal. Relative to FACTOR 5 Location &amp; Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for teams with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a project team(s) is not co-located.<br /><br />SUBMISSION FORMAT: Three (3) complete and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission. Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for a seven-year program, the NHLBI Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network). The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-HR-14-01. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
<p>The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials to prevent, treat, and/or improve the outcome of patients with or at risk for Acute Lung Injury (ALI). More than one trial will be conducted simultaneously and it is expected that multiple, complex trials will be completed during the course of the contract. The emphasis is expected to be on prevention and early treatments. The Network will consist of approximately eleven Clinical Centers (CCs), each with at least one other recruiting site, and a CCC.&nbsp; Each CC will have two investigators from one institution. The principal investigator will be a qualified intensive care clinician scientist (does not have to be Pulmonary) and the other clinical investigator will be from another specialty, such as an emergency department clinician, with early access to patients at risk for lung injury. The CCs shall also include at least one other institution that will participate in enrollment and study conduct, but not network leadership. Each CC will be expected to enroll a total of 220 subjects over 5 &frac12; years of a seven-year project.</p>
<p>The CCC will coordinate all aspects of the research and communication within the Network, including development of protocols, management and analysis of data, assurance of data quality, and statistical and clinical leadership.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) at China Lake is seeking information from potential sources regarding Radio Frequency (RF) Electronic Warfare Systems Integration Test Environment (SITE) system, upgrade to an existing system currently at China Lake, and maintenance for all EW SITE and EW SITE Lite Systems for the Advanced Weapons Laboratory (AWL) located at China Lake, CA and Pt Mugu, CA. The results of this sources sought will be utilized to determine if other sources exist (all set-aside categories will be considered) and determine if commercial items are suitable for off the shelf use or if commercial items could be modified to meet the agencys needs.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.
PROGRAM BACKGROUND
The F/A-18 Advanced Weapons Laboratory (AWL) currently utilizes an Electronic Warfare Systems Integration Test Environment (EW SITE) to support the ability to validate performance and integration of the systems and capabilities of all variants of the F/A-18.
  The EW SITE is used to test the full complement of F/A-18 subsystems using the RF spectrum.  This provides digitally controlled frequency, phase, amplitude, and time based modulation.  Adding additional test assets to the AWL serves to provide a more robust threat environment in the form of a high pulse density in a dynamic, simulated, flight environment.  Simulated tests in a lab environment versus a flight environment allows the AWL to generate more scenarios that approximate real threats the F/A-18 will face in hostile circumstances.  Having a lab test environment that emulates the pulse density and characteristics of EW Flight Test Threat Ranges allows testing of systems for extended periods of time with the benefit of visibility into system performance, that lab test instrumentation provides, which is not available on an aircraft.
  
The existing Government RF EW Site system was procured under contract N68936-09-C-0971 and N68936-09-C-0138. These contracts were awarded to Applied Geo Technologies, Inc. as the prime contractor and AAI Corporation as the subcontractor. These were both Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts.  Information regarding the prior contracts can be requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process. The FOIA information concerning the current contract is available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/counsel/textonly/foia-txt.htm.
NAWCWD intends to award a sole source follow on contract to AAI Corporation based on the authority under Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
 
REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

The Government's EW Site System consists of three major elements to include SSIs, stimulus cabinet, and maintenance alignment cabinet. AAI Corporation is the developer and manufacturer of the SITE and is the only known source of equipment and software compatible with the existing electronic warfare test equipment.  Compatibility with the existing system is required to enable sharing of hardware components between threat simulators and leveraging of existing government-developed threat scenario software.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this Sources Sought to provide a detailed technical description of the Governments requirements.
ELIGIBILITY
The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 334515.
 
The Product Service Code (PSC) is 5985.
SUBMISSION DETAILS
Interested businesses shall submit a statement of capability and include:
Description of relevant contract experience (Government and Commercial).  Address your experience with Electronic Warfare Threat Simulation Systems and demonstrated capability of your company's resources to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work to include compatibility with the Government's existing EW SITE simulators without modification to either the hardware or software components.  Describe your systems ability to share hardware components between threat simulators and transportability of Threat Simulation files created on your equipment (machine to machine) to existing government owned simulator systems without modification of the threat simulation.
Any interested party that feels they can meet this requirement must identify in writing their interest, experience, and capability statement of past work no later than April 20, 2012 via email to the Contract Specialist, Terri Hand, via a Microsoft Word .doc or Acrobat Adobe .pdf file.
  File must not exceed 10 pages with a minimum font size of 12 point.  As a general rule, no information is better than bad information. Classified material shall not be submitted.  All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size, and Points-of-Contact (POC) including name, phone number, fax number, and email address. No phone or email solicitations with regards to the status of the RFP will be accepted prior to its release.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCES MODIFICATION
<SOLNBR>DE-AC52-09NA28609A005
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>04272012
<CONTACT>Ray Cruz, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-845-4772, Email Raymond.Cruz@nnsa.doe.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCES MODIFICATION.<br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Contracts and Procurement Division (CPD) intends to issue a modification to contract DE-AC52-09NA28609 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1), to WesDyne International LLC, I-70 Exit 74 Gate D, Madison, PA 15663 to continue commercial down-blending services for an additional 5 metric tons (MT) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU), and to store the LEU for a LEU Inventory Reserve. The NNSA's Office of Fissile Materials Disposition (OFMD) and Y-12 Site Office will oversee the down-blending and storage of the material. DOE is evaluating its inventory of excess HEU, and decisions relating to the timely and availability of HEU have not been made to release a sufficient amount of HEU to warrant a new acquisition at this time, and further delay would likely result in disruption or shutdown of the only remaining U.S. HEU down-blending process. This material will provide additional LEU that will allow the OFMD to meet non-proliferation objectives and will be added to a larger domestic inventory of LEU that has been set-aside to support the surplus plutonium disposition program (MOX Backup LEU Inventory). Under the existing contract, WesDyne International LLC has subcontracted with the B&amp;W Nuclear Fuel Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and with this partnership is the only company capable of down-blending and storing the additional HEU material to satisfy the NNSA requirements to increase the MOX Backup LEU Inventory and maintain the industrial base. The applicable NAICS code is 325188 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a modification under the current contract and is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capabilities to fulfill this requirement no later than April 27, 2012, 4:00 pm MST. NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred in response to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any modification to the existing contact. Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be e-mailed to Raymond.cruz@nnsa.doe.gov .</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell lock in Massena, New York. Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is in service from late March until late December each year. Typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room&nbsp;for transiting vessels. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The project includes installation of seven (7) steel pipes approximately 50 feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of 12 square feet with cross sections varying from rectangular to round. These pipes shall be embedded in the upstream concrete miter gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gate valves having openings 5 feet - 7 inches wide and 2 feet - 3 inches high with one (1) valve being electrically operated and the other manually operated. The work will require removal of approximately 1,800 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery through the miter gate sill at the lock. The work will also include connecting the knife gate actuators to an existing power source, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work&nbsp;to be performed inside&nbsp;the lock will need to be completed during the 2013 winter shutdown period beginning in January 2013 during an approximate ten (10) week period when the lock is dewatered. Work in the gallery through the miter gate sill that will not interfere with navigation shall be accomplished during the 2013 Navigation Season which begins in late March 3013. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Cost range for this project&nbsp;will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The anticipated release date for the IFB is on or about May 4, 2012 with a bid opening date of June 19, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An anticipated firm, fixed price contract will be awarded on or about June 25, 2012. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The specifications and drawings shall be provided on&nbsp;CD at a non-refundable cost of $25.00 US Funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Payment may be made by check payable to the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, 180 Andrews Street, Massena, NY 13662 or electronically using a debit or credit card at <a href="http://www.pay.gov">www.pay.gov</a>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Applicable NAICS code - 237990, Size Standard - $33.5M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an unrestricted procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

Offerors will be required to provide a product sample as part of the proposal. The sample vehicle is not required to be fully production representative, however it must demonstrate that it is a mature design and with minor engineering effort, capable of meeting the production requirement. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement&nbsp;is 336112,&nbsp;with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

However, there are Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds planned for this effort in FY12 and FY13, followed by procurement funds planned beginning in FY14.</p>

FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  
       Office of Acquisition Operations
       Technology Acquisition Center-Austin
       1701 Director's Blvd., Suite 600
Austin, TX 78744

2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) required to satisfy immediate storage requests of the Corporate Data Center Operations (CDCO) sites located at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC), Hines Information Technology Center (HITC) and Philadelphia Information Technology Center (PITC). The proposed contractual action will provide Hitachi brand hardware, the Hitachi Software Management Suite including the Aptare chargeback tool, Cisco hardware, cables, project management, installation, configuration, testing and acceptance, warranty, and training support at the CDCO facilities.      The contractor shall deliver the hardware, install and configure the equipment, perform testing and acceptance tasks, provide training (optional line item) and arrange with each manufacturer for all warranty support at each CDCO site.  Finally warranty shall be provided for a period of five years beginning on the date of acceptance.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Currently, CDCO is experiencing storage shortages and therefore requires a second Virtual Storage Head in order to meet the storage demands and accommodate for growing storage demands.  Hitachi is the only known manufacturer of a Virtual Storage Head that is compatible with the existing CDCO virtual storage solution.  The Hitachi Software Management Suite and the Aptare Storage Reporting Software are also required in order to administer the Hitachi hardware Virtual Storage Head.  In addition, CDCO also requires additional Cisco network ports to facilitate network connectivity to the storage environment.  Currently, CDCO is aware that only Cisco brand name products will meet the network requirements for the additional storage based on compatibility with the existing network connectivity system.  Midrange Storage Arrays are also required; however, since the Hitachi Virtual Storage Head is compatible with several Midrange Storage Array brands, a brand name is not required.  The optional line item for training will only be exercised in the event a new Midrange Storage Array system is quoted.  Finally, cables, project management, configuration, installation, acceptance testing, warranty, and training are also required in support of the storage system.  
4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 253J(b) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."   

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available for these brand name items and services.  Due to the need for additional storage to support future mission requirements, CDCO requires the acquisition of an additional Hitachi Virtual Storage Head at the AITC site.  Only a Hitachi brand Virtual Storage Head is compatible with the existing Hitachi Virtual Storage Head because direct access storage requests from internal and external applications and servers cannot be routed to separate storage systems.  All storage requests from applications and servers must be routed central to a Virtual Storage Head, therefore the same brand is required in order to ensure the storage demand is met and no technical infrastructure issues occur.  In addition, the Hitachi Storage Management Software Suite is the only software that can manage the Hitachi brand Virtual Storage Head because of manufacturer restrictions within the hardware device.  In addition, Hitachi will provide warranty support only on equipment that is delivered and installed by an authorized reseller.

Regarding the Aptare Storage Reporting software, the existing direct access storage devices installed at each CDCO site use Aptare Storage Reporting software.  Aptare Storage Reporting software is licensed by the amount of storage used.  In order to continue the original functionality obtained from CDCO's investment of four petabytes an additional two petabytes of Aptare Storage Reporting software are required because CDCO is increasing the amount of storage as a result of this procurement.  Procurement of the same brand storage reporting software is required to ensure a consistent reporting tool is used to monitor the entire enterprise storage environment.  As discussed below, market research reveals that no other software operates seamlessly with the existing Aptare Storage Reporting software.  

Regarding the requirement for Cisco equipment, the existing CDCO Virtual Storage Solution is currently architected and configured to use the Cisco Storage Area Network (SAN) platform of equipment, protocols and functionality.  VA requires a solution compatible with existing SAN infrastructure protocols and functionality to continue to provide data storage/protection, and Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations services for the CDCO and its customers through electronic replication of data between sites using a single SAN management tool. Only Cisco brand name equipment will work in the existing Cisco SAN equipment and be fully interoperable and compatible with the existing VA SAN infrastructure and support system.  The Cisco SAN Model also allows the CDCO to leverage the Cisco National Maintenance contract, which goes into effect in the second year of service, lowering the overall VA network maintenance costs.  In addition, Cisco will provide warranty support only on equipment that is delivered and installed by an authorized reseller.

The virtual storage solution required by VA is made of up several brand name items and functional parts that interoperate with each other in order for VA Information Technology systems to store data and be accessible to VA users and system administrators.  In order to obtain a fully operable, integrated, virtual storage solution, VA requires a single source for delivery, installation, configuration, acceptance testing, and warranty.  If multiple vendors were selected for each individual element or brand name, not only would it be more likely that the solution would experience malfunctions due to interoperability concerns, but VA would experience considerable difficulty identifying the applicable contractor(s) and holding the contractor(s) accountable for system malfunctions.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.    Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying brand name items, there are multiple authorized resellers of the brand name items on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  Limited competition among these vendors is anticipated.  The Justification & Approval (J&A) and Request for Quotations will be submitted to four NASA SEWP IV GWAC groups in order to fully notify all interested parties.  Any quotations received will be evaluated. Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3 the delivery order award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site. In addition, this J&A will be made publicly available on the FBO web site.     

7.	Actions to Increase competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research in a timely manner so that other solutions can be considered.  

8.	Market Research:  Hitachi Virtual Storage Head market research was performed in July of 2011 by reviewing recent procurement history and reviewing technical documentation of Hitachi and other Virtual Storage Head manufacturers.  Through the market research obtained, the Government's technical experts determined that only the Hitachi brand Virtual Storage Head is compatible with the existing Virtual Storage Head devices installed at each CDCO site.  If a different brand of Virtual Storage Head is procured, access to Veteran data will not be available to users of the applications in a timely manner, and the potential for technical issues would adversely affect VA's mission to support the Veterans.  In addition, the manufacturer confirmed that only an authorized reseller is able to delivery, install and configure the equipment in order for VA to receive warranty on the system.

Aptare storage reporting software market research was conducted in July of 2011 through internet searches and review of information gathered from Aptare and other storage reporting software technical documentation available on the internet.  This market research indicated that no other software is compatible with the existing Aptare licenses.  If different brand name software was purchased, VA would experience compatibility issues that would not allow CDCO to properly manage the storage solution.  These issues could only be resolved by re-procurement of a single storage reporting software. 

Cisco hardware must be compatible and functional with components currently in place.  In February 2011, the Government's technical experts reviewed network hardware with similar capabilities to the aforementioned Cisco hardware via the Internet.  Based on this market research, the hardware provided by similar network manufacturers, Blackbox and Brocade, could not meet VA's SAN interoperability, scalability and manageability requirements.  Specifically, other brand name hardware would not be compatible with pre-existing Cisco hardware. 

As demonstrated through market research, any hardware or software purchased from providers other than Hitachi, Aptare, and Cisco would not be compatible with the existing infrastructure and would adversely affect VA's mission to support the Veterans. 
 
9.	Other Facts:  Market research in December 2011 utilizing the NASA SEWP IV GWAC Manufacturer Lookup tool revealed that 13 authorized resellers of Hitachi brand name items and Cisco brand name items are current contract holders.  Additionally, these 13 contract holders can also provide the required support services.  Therefore, limited competition is expected for this proposed action.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Since the City of San Diego is performing the Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program for their own South Bay Reclamation Plant at many of the identical monitoring stations for the International Wastewater Treatment Plant, the City of San Diego has expressed a willingness to cost share these two programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Significant savings to the federal government and the City of San Diego per year can be realized by sharing the two monitoring programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is only if the City of San Diego is allowed to perform the work involved in the program, as the City does not intend to bid their portion of the work out, and will not share in the costs if the government solicits for a Contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Savings to be realized will be on costs of performing the on and off shore sampling, analysis of samples and data obtained, documentation and forms required, and in maintaining the database of results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, since the City of San Diego has on staff trained technical personnel capable of interpreting monitoring data and laboratory results, the federal government will benefit by having access to these personnel and not having to hire occasional consultants for the interpretation of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant data. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In recognition of the co-ownership of the land and ocean outfall facilities, and the substantial savings to both the City of San Diego and the federal government for sharing of the Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting programs, it is advantageous for the International Boundary &amp; Water Commission, U.
