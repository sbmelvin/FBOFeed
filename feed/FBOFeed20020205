PROGRAM OVERVIEW: The GPS III program objective is to preserve and build on the successes of the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) by creating a new architecture for the assured delivery of enhanced position, velocity, and timing (PVT) signals, and related services to meet the needs of the next generation of GPS users.  The GPS III program includes an integrated space segment (SS) and control segment (CS) system that incorporates the Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NUDET) and defines the Signal-in-Space (SIS) to User Equipment (UE) interface.  The system must provide a best value solution with the flexibility to anticipate and respond to future military and civilian needs.  The GPS III security infrastructure will provide user access to and protection of the entire system.  The GPS III system should facilitate the incorporation of additional mission capabilities (i.e. Blue Force Tracking (BFT), Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, etc.) that may be defined in the future.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  It has been determined that a contractor under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) may not be awarded a prime contract for the GPS III effort.  Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting are allowed; however, the participating companies must clearly demonstrate in their proposal how they intend to prevent disclosure of classified or export controlled information (reference DD 254) to their foreign team members.  This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) and SAP/SAR (Special Access Program/Special Access Requirements) security requirements.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-888-352-9333) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation. Notes: 8, 22, and 25.

<DESC>The Philippines' rapid population growth is outpacing economic development and is stifling the country's fight to reduce pervasive poverty among the masses.  The Philippines also faces challenges in containing infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis (TB), being one of the 22 high-burden TB countries in the world.  While the country has thus far escaped the explosive HIV/AIDS epidemics that have occurred in other countries, the potential for a rapid increase starting within high-risk groups is great.  An accelerated spread of infection could occur if prevention efforts are not continued and expanded.  The Government of the Philippines (GOP), USAID, and other partners/stakeholders have recognized that the expanded delivery of FP/MCH/TB-DOTS/HIV-AIDS services has been hampered either by unrealistic or outdated legal and regulatory barriers and the absence of appropriate supportive policies or guidelines both at the national and local levels.  To improve the policy and financing environment, USAID is inviting US firms to bid for a major contract that will analyze policy gaps and institute measures that will address them.  This activity will focus on policies that will (1) ensure long term contraceptive security, (2) improve service provision, and (3) assure sustainable financing for FP/MCH/TB-DOTS/HIV-AIDS information, services and products. The cost reimbursement contract is expected to be completed within a period of about four years.

Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about March 4, 2002. To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 BOX #1, FPO AP 96515, or  Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd. 1308 Pasay City, Philippines.  You may also send your requests by e-mail to marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP.  Our telephone nos. are (632) 552-9926  and (632) 552-9924.  Our fax nos. are  (632) 551-9297 and (632) 552-9999. The deadline for submission of proposals is May 3, 2002. 

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" floppy disk (MS Word97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website.  The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. 

As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.  Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizops.gov/) for amendments.

<DESC>Rapid population growth has been identified, as one of the country's most critical development problems.  The 2000 census placed the country's population at 76.5 million, with an annual growth rate of 2.36.  If this growth rate continues, the population can be expected to double approximately in 30 years, the fastest in the region.  This rapid annual growth rate is greatly the result of a high total fertility rate.  Women are having more children than they actually want (3.2. children desired as against 3.7 children actual, according to the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey).  Acceptance of modern contraceptive methods has steadily increased from 24.9% in 1993 to 33.1% in 2001.  However, family planning remains a controversial program, primarily due to the active opposition by certain sectors of society to the use of so-called artificial contraceptives and to misinformation about the safety of these methods.  As a result, many Filipino men and women who want to limit their family size are reluctant to adopt the methods proven to be most effective. 

To overcome this barrier to social acceptance, USAID is inviting U.S. firms to bid for a major contract that will implement a communication and advocacy strategy and program, whose purpose is to actively promote the practice of family planning as a normal, everyday behavior that is part of a healthy lifestyle.  These initiatives are expected to result in couples feeling more comfortable actively practicing family planning and attaining their desired family size, as well as helping improve their health and that of their families.  The communication and advocacy program should be able to achieve the following results: 1) mass media and other forms of communications are positively portraying family planning as a mainstream health intervention; 2) key segments of society (women's groups, the business community, government leaders, entertainment celebrities, etc.) are advocating the use of family planning; and 3) health providers are offering family planning as part of a routine health service package.  The cost reimbursement contract is expected to be completed within a period of about five YEARS.

Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about March 4, 2002. To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 BOX #1, FPO AP 96515, or  Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd. 1308 Pasay City, Philippines.

<DESC>USAID/Philippines is pioneering a new approach to improve tuberculosis (TB) control in the Philippines -- that of actively strengthening private sector diagnosis and treatment to control TB. This is a proposed four-year program (Oct 2002-Sept 2006) aimed at increasing successful diagnosis and treatment of TB patients who seek care through the commercial private sector.  By the end of program, the for-profit private sector will have demonstrated its ability to treat TB successfully. Attainment of the above objectives will be indicated by achieving a cure rate of 85 percent, using directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) among TB patients who are receiving services entirely or partially through the commercial private sector.  

Anticipated outputs include: policies, guidelines and regulations revised and expanded to support appropriate, complementary implementation by both public and private providers; best strategies identified through operations research to improve and expand DOTS implementation in the private sector; service delivery models are piloted in specific areas; best approaches are taken to scale in 30 strategic areas nationwide; sustainability of TB program is strengthened through improved teaching and training in medical schools. Secondary outputs may include improved teacher education and training in primary and secondary schools and improved health seeking behavior of the public; and, national health financing schemes for TB treatment are strengthened to increase  the capacity of the private sector to deliver TB services. The cost reimbursement contract is expected to be completed within a period of about four years.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yakima Field Office, 1917 Marsh Road, Yakima WA   98907, has a requirement to develop an automation plan for the Yakima Field Office Power plants (Roza and Chandler Powerplant Systems).  The Yakima Field Office's Power personnel are responsible for the operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities, water conveyance and river regulation facilities in the Yakima River Basin serving irrigation districts containing nearly 500,000 acres of irrigable land, as well as the Chandler and Roza Power Plants and approximately 68 miles of 34.5&#64979;kv transmission line.  Roza and Prosser Diversion Dams, Chandler canal and approximately the upper ten miles of Roza canal are integral parts of the water power service to the power plants.  These facilities operate on a year&#64979;round basis, except for outages for maintenance or extreme weather conditions.  With the increasing cost of power and fish demands the Bureau of Reclamation is looking for alternatives for the Roza and Chandler power plant systems to increase efficiency, divert less water from the river, and reduce costs in an effort to better satisfy the various demands.  The conceptual automation plan must address both the Chandler and Roza Power Plant Systems.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and will be a best value negotiated award.   At this time we intend to evaluate past performance, experience, the contractor's capabilities to accomplish the requirement, and price and price related factors.  The evaluation criteria is subject to change and will be further defined in the solicitation.  Quoters may request the RFQ in writing and mail to the Bureau of Reclamation, 1150 N. Curtis Road, Suite 100, Boise ID 83706-1234, or by FAX at (208) 378-5108 - requests must reference the RFQ number.  Please include a contact name, physical address, phone and fax numbers, and your e-mail address in your request.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.  We anticipate having a solicitation available approximately February 15, 2002, and quotes due March 13, 2002.  The RFQ will be issued on paper and there will be no charge for the first copy of the solicitation.  At this time, a site visit has not been scheduled but the RFQ, when issued, will include the specific date, time, meeting location and contact point for the site visit.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business, this acquisition will be a full and open competition. The  applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 and the size standard is $4 million.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by this agency.  The due date for quotes referenced in this synopsis is subject to change.

In some cases, compounds will be evaluated for toxicity and safety under conditions of repeated administration, including mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies.  The primary requirements are:  (1) to develop experimental protocols for toxicology and safety studies in accordance with current FDA GLP regulations for nonclinical laboratory studies (21 CFR Part 58) http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/21cfr58_01.html) and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines; (2) to conduct studies in rodents, rabbits, beagle dogs, or rhesus monkeys using established techniques, study parameters, and statistical methods of data analysis; and (3) to prepare Technical Reports structured according to the currently accepted requirements (style and content) necessary for documentation submitted in support of an IND, RDRC, or NDA application.  The Contractor is required to have an AAALAC accredited animal facility and to perform most of the assays under GLP - FDA regulations (e.g.,  the current FDA draft guidance document "Developing Medical Imaging Drugs and Biological Products" dated June 2000 http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/3646dft.htm) and ICH Guidelines.  A three (3) year base contract with two (2), one (1) year options is contemplated.  One (1) contract award is anticipated on or about September 30, 2002.

RFP No. NIMH-02-DB-0005 will be available on or about February 22, 2002 and the receipt date of proposals on or about April 23, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>S -- PRIVATIZATION OF ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT FT. DETRICK, MD
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SP0600-01-0246
<CONTACT>Mary Jo  Fehr, Contract Specialist , Phone 703 767-8131, Fax 703 767-8757, Email mfehr@desc.dla.mil - James Cotton, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-8583, Fax 703-767-8757, Email jcotton@desc.dla.mil
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to acquire electrical distribution service and to privatize the electrical distribution system at Ft. Detrick, Maryland on an other than full and open competition basis.  

In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 and  FAR 41, the Government intends to transfer the Government owned electrical distribution system at Fort Detrick, MD and award a Utility Service Contract for the provision of electrical distribution service at Ft. Detrick, MD to Allegheny Power.  Privatization will transfer to the private sector the responsibility for the ownership, operation, maintenance, and repair of the Government-owned utility system.  

The Ft. Detrick electrical distribution system consists of approximately 28.2 circuit-miles of overhead primary distribution lines and approximately two circuit-miles of underground primary distribution lines.  It includes 329 pad and pole-mounted transformers, and approximately 277 primary/secondary electric meters.  Additionally, it includes 100 poles rated for 34.5 kV, 668 poles rated for 4.16 kV and 200 poles for secondary service.  The system has seven distribution substations with capacitors and breakers and the substations range in size from 7,500 to 15,000 kVA.

The Defense Energy Support Center justification for the use of Other than Full and Open Competition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  In response to Sources Sought Notices published by the Defense Energy Support Center in the Commerce Business Daily on July 21, 2000 and August 3, 2001, only one responsible source, Allegheny Power, a regulated public utility, expressed an interest in the provision of electrical distribution service and the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Ft. Detrick electrical distribution system.  Based on the above, the government has determined that Allegheny Power is the only responsible source for the subject requirements and that no other supplies or services will satisfy these requirements.  Accordingly, to satisfy its electrical distribution requirement at Fort Detrick, the Government intends to enter into a regulated utility service contract subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body under FAR Part 41.

<DESC>NA On or about 01 March 2002, the Alaska District Corps of Engineers will issue a Phase I Request for Proposals for the design and construction of a POWER PLANT COOLING SYSTEM.  The power plant cooling system is the Heat Rejection Cooling System for the Coal- Fired Central Heating and Power Plant (CHPP) at Ft. Wainwright, Alaska.  The purpose of this project is to replace the existing 500,000 SF cooling pond system with a new Dry, Air-Cooled Condenser System.  Phase I proposals are to be received on or about 15  April 2002.  Description of Work:  Design and construct air-cooled condenser systems for condensing steam from three 5 Mega Watt (MW) condensing/extraction turbine generators, and one 2 MW condensing/extraction turbine generator.  The new systems shall be  closed loop piping from turbine to new finned tube condenser units that are cooled by ambient air.  A new air-cooled condenser system shall be constructed for each turbine.  The Ft. Wainwright Central Heat and Power Plant shall remain operational and capa ble of supplying Ft. Wainwright electrical demand throughout the project.  Phasing and coordination of work will be required.  Turbines shall be taken off-line for minimum amount of time to connect new units.  The 1950 era steam turbines manufactured by Ge neral Electric Corporation, were designed to generate 5.0 MW at an exhaust system pressure of 1.5 inches HG absolute (corresponding steam saturation temperature of 92 deg F). The smaller turbine was designed for 2.0 MW at an exhaust pressure of 1.5 inches HG absolute. The solicitation criteria will rely upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the Offeror a degree of design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements. New work includes:  1.  Construct condensers units approxim ately 100 feet east of the CHPP.  2.Construct pre-engineered electrical equipment building to contain system pumps, controls, and electrical equipment. 3.  New Condenser Units shall include concrete foundation, louver systems to regulate and re-circulate a ir to prevent freeze-up during severe artic cold weather, such as -60 deg F operation, with pre-heat coils for start-up and new function block based distributed control system (digital controls) to be tied into existing CHPP existing WDPF distributed contr ol system.  4.  Construct new ducts, piping, pumps, electrical systems as required for closed-system operation between turbines and new condensers.  5.  Install automatic fire protection systems.  6.  Demolish existing water-cooled condensers on each turbi ne and associated system components to existing cooling pond, including pumps, piping, controls, etc.  Seal existing cooling water piping, intake/return wet well and tunnel access to cooling pond. 7.  Design, fabricate, and install new connection fittings at turbine outlet.  8.  Relocate electrical substation yard equipment and overhead electric distribution system.  Other relocation of, modification of, and connection to, existing power distribution system. 9.  Construct new access roadway.  10. Test all e xcavated soils for contamination and remediate if discovered.  11.  Remediate lead or asbestos where affecting new work..  12.  Modify and connect to existing potable water supply system.   Modify CHPP utilities including the rain water leaders, compressed  air, miscellaneous piping, and other components as necessary.  13.  Modify existing utilidors, seal any hazardous insulation materials and clean the utilidor.  14.  Install antiterrorism and force protection systems required by regulation and supplemental  guidance.  Proposal Evaluation:  This will be a two-phase design-build selection process.  The following evaluation factors are for informational purposes.  The government reserves the right to modify the evaluation factors prior to issuing the solicitati on.  Phase I solicitation period will be on or about 03/01/02 through 04/15/02 and will consist of soliciting and receiving Statements of Qualifications that in clude factors:  (A)  Experience of: Construction Contractor, Design Contractor, Construction and Design Team; (B)  Past Performance of:  Construction Contractor, Design Subcontractor, and Construction and Design Team; and (C)  Project Management Plan;  Fac tors (A), (B), and (C) shall have approximately equal importance.

<SUBJECT>M--New NNSA Model Announcement
<SOLNBR>DE-RP04-02ALNNSA_MODEL
<RESPDATE>022602
<ARCHDATE>03282002
<CONTACT>Michael Frietze, Contracting Officer, 505-845-6158, mfrietze@doeal.gov;Michael Loera, Contract Specialist, 505-845-5747, mloera@doeal.gov
<DESC>Announcement The purpose of this Announcement is to request organizations that manage industrial and/or research and development facilities to provide information that can be used by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) in the development of the NNSA ?Model for Improving Management and Performance.? NNSA has prepared a strategy paper that identifies the issue, strategy, goals and desired outcomes.  The NNSA Model effort addressed herein is a separate and distinct activity from the extend/compete decision discussed below for the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) management and operating (M&O) contract, but the NNSA Model will be used either for the competition or for the negotiation of an extension to the present SNL contract. This Announcement is not a procurement or a request for a proposal; therefore, no ?contractor bid or proposal information? (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104-3) is requested or desired. THE DOE/NNSA HAS NOT DECIDED WHETHER TO NEGOTIATE AN EXTENSION OF THE CONTRACT WITH SANDIA CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION, OR TO COMPETE THE CONTRACT FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF THE SNL. In line with the President?s Federal government reform initiatives, the NNSA Administrator plans to develop an efficient and agile nuclear security enterprise recognized for world-class technical leadership and program management.  Key to improving NNSA effectiveness and efficiency is redesigning the Federal-contractor relationship and creating a simpler more cooperative contracting model that capitalizes on the private-sector expertise and experience of the management and operating contractors, while simultaneously increasing contractor accountability for high performance and responsiveness to NNSA program and stewardship requirements. The NNSA Administrator has requested the NNSA Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) to pilot a new NNSA Model for improving management and performance at SNL.  During the pilot, AL will develop, implement and assess the outcome of the Model.  Following the pilot, NNSA will consider implementing the Model at other NNSA laboratories and facilities.  Federal oversight for nuclear operations safety, safeguards & security, and bio-surety will remain the same. The contract mechanism that NNSA utilizes in carrying out its responsibilities for its laboratories and facilities is the use of a management and operating contract, as provided in Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) Part 970.  Absent implementation of the new NNSA Model, many FAR and DEAR Clauses are required to be included in NNSA?s Management and Operating (M&O) Contract.  Those clauses are in the current SNL contract and others would be added or modified by the latest Federal Acquisition Circulars and DOE Acquisition Letters, including the DEAR 970 Rewrite of Regulations Governing Management and Operating Contracts (65 Federal Register 80994, 12/22/2000). AL has summarized the clauses in a table entitled ?SNL M&O CONTRACT - FAR & DEAR AND OTHER CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS CLAUSE SUMMARY? (SNL Clause Summary). NNSA is specifically interested in receiving from organizations that manage industrial and/or research and development facilities, including non-profit and educational institutions, written comments which address the following: (1) identify broad ranging ideas: (a) which have demonstrated proven results in improving the management, cost, or performance of comparable scientific/technical organizations (public or private), together with examples where the suggested approach has been implemented and assessed or (b) which hold promise of such improvements, even if not demonstrated in similar organizational settings  (these ideas should focus on improvements in management and performance of the NNSA and its M&O contractors, particularly with respect to the business arrangement (e.g., contract, cooperative agreement, etc.) defining the relationships of the parties and approaches to oversight and accountability); (2) identify the SNL contract requirements (DOE Directives/Orders, etc.) that are more stringent than those requirements utilized at government-owned-contractor-operated (GOCO) type facilities by other Federal agencies (for example, are there other GOCO type contracts or industrial-type facility contracts that contain terms or conditions that more effectively meet the agencies? needs); and (3) identify which clauses in the SNL Clause Summary columns 1 and 2 should be changed or removed to bring industrial or commercial approaches to NNSA and address how those changes or removal would lead to the desired outcomes identified in the strategy paper. Please forward written comments, by February 26, 2002, to the following e-mail address: nnsamodel@doeal.gov Based upon the comments received, AL may invite responding organizations to meet with AL representatives for further clarification.  In your response, please identify an organizational point of contact.  AL plans to make the final model available at the web site identified below.  NNSA may utilize expertise of NNSA?s M&O contractors to assist AL in the development of the model. The strategy paper, the SNL M&O Contract, the SNL Clause Summary, and related information pertaining to this initiative can be accessed at http://www.doeal.gov/new-nnsa-model/.  Interested parties are asked to periodically check this web site for any updates. Questions regarding this initiative should be sent to the e-mail address:  nnsamodel@doeal.gov or contact Mike Frietze at (505) 845-6158 or Michael Loera at (505) 845-5747.

On Tuesday, February 19, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), with conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective small business sub-contractors for the construction phase of the new United States District Courthouse in Miami, Florida.

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the North Shore University Hospital for a five year continuation of a project entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  During the next five years of this project the contractor will: 1) expand the analysis of sib pairs to include existing national and international collections and perform Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) analyses on all sib pair collections; 2) collect 1,000 rheumatoid arthritis trios to conduct association studies based on genetic regions of interest identified during sib pair analysis; and 3) establish collaborative arrangements for the conduct of hypotheses driven projects using resources previously generated.  The projects will focus on genetics, pathogenesis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. 

The North Shore University Hospital has the prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work under contract N01-AR-7-2232 entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available.  Any questions should be directed to Donna Baker, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, NIAMS, at 301-594-2543 or by e-mail at db394u@nih.gov.  See Note 22

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer technical questions pertaining to this synopsis/solicitation as follows:  1.  Is there a record of outages and items repaired or replaced for a.  TWTAs, B. Device Equipment, especially heater and thermostat unit, C. Modems and D. Up and Down converters?  A record book of all outages, repairs, preventative maintenance calls, and replaced equipment is maintained in both the NAWCAD Patuxent River and BHTI Earth Stations and is one of the CDRLs required by this contract.  The Earth Stations at NAWCAD and BHTI are redundant systems and have not logged any outages due to equipment failure.  The following units maintenance history is as follows: a.  TWTAs, A new TWTA was purchased in 1988 as a replacement unit for a failed unit.  The remaining units have high hours and CLINs exist as part of the contract to replace any units that fail due to TWT failure.  Otherwise, there have been a minimal amount of repairs made to the original units.  b.  Deice equipment, heater and thermostat units-  The deicing equipment is used a small amount of time at both sites and a minimal amount of maintenance has been required on this system.
c.  Modems-  The SDM-8000 modems were purchased in 1993 to replace lower rate modems and have required a minimal amount of maintenance since their installation. 
d.  Up and down converters-  The up and downconverters have required a moderate amount of maintenance.  2.  Does the Navy want or expect routine Preventative Maintenance Inspections (PMIs) to be accomplished?  Routine preventative maintenance inspections are a requirement in maintaining this system that operates 24 hours a day.  However, any PMIs are to be scheduled with the Navy to make sure it does not conflict with day-to-day operations.  3.  The proposal requires on the cover sheet the Name, address, point of contact, telephone and fax numbers of the cognizant DCAA auditor, ACO, and DCMA for the prime and any proposed subcontractors, what if the company has none of the above?  Complete as much as practicably possible.  The proposal due date remains this Thursday, November 15, 2001 and the terms and conditions of synopsis/solicitation N00421-01-R-0291 have not been changed.

<DESC>S (SOLID STATE POWER AMPLIFIERS)?

NAVAIR only intends to replace the existing TWTA's when we have a failure of the TWT itself.  If any other part of the TWTA fails NAVAIR will want it repaired if possible.  However, when a TWT failure does occur, NAVAIR intends to purchase (as a CLIN item) a replacement unit similar in specifications to the units already in the system. A Model XTRD-200C Rack-mount TWT Power Amplifier (170 Watt) made by Xicom Technology has already been purchased in 1998 to replace a failed Varian Model VZC-6962D7 HPA and NAVAIR requires similar equipment to the XTRD-200C as additional replacements to HPAs that fail in the future. NAVAIR consistently maintains one spare unit in case of failure and on the advent of a TWT failure of an operational unit NAVAIR will immediately purchase a replacement HPA to free up one of the operational units as a spare.  The requirement is that the replacement unit must conform to the salient specifications as shown in paragraph 4.5 of the Statement of Work (SOW).  An SSPA can be used if will satisfy the requirements of the SOW and not require major modifications to the Satellite Earth Station hardware.

Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, Factor 3 - Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include proposed Task Order 0001), and Factor 4 - Emergency Response Mobilization Plan are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 5 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 5.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Offerors shall submit proposals via electronic format on either a CD-ROM disk or 3 1/2 inch floppy disk.  The acceptable electronic formats for proposals include Word (95 - 00), Excel (95 - 00), or Adobe Acrobat (3.0 or 4.0) (.pdf).  Electronic mail is not an acceptable format.  Offerors shall ensure that proposal disks are virus free, and free of password protection.  If access to proposal data is prohibited due to viruses, passwords, or wrong format, the offeror may be considered unacceptable.  A pre-proposal conference will be held in conjunction with the site visit for the proposed Task Order 0001.  Offerors are encouraged to participate in the conference/site visit.  The date and time of the pre-proposal conference and site visit have not yet been determined.  Offerors interested in participating in the pre-proposal conference and site visit shall fax the following information on company letterhead not later than December 17, 2001 to Bea Appling at 619-532-0771:  Company Name, Name of Individuals attending, Social Security #, Date of Birth, U. S. Citizenship.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than offeror(s) submitting the lowest total price(s) for proposed Task Order 0001; and to limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals, and to award to the offeror(s) submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be most advantageous to the Government.   Offeror's are advised that an award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially offering the most favorable terms.  Offeror(s) should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal(s).  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal conference/site visit or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.  The solicitation will be available only by electronic media and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under pre-solicitation notice N68711-02-R-8302.

Prospective offerors must register on the web site.  There will be no paper copies of this solicitation issued.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking University and Industry partners for the Advanced Component Technology (ACT) Program NRA. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to release a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) in the near future for the Advanced Component Technology (ACT) Program.  The ACT Program, formerly known as the Advanced Technology Initiatives Program (ATIP) seeks proposals for technology development activities leading to new components and subsystems to be developed in support of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE).  The objectives of the ACT program are to identify, develop and demonstrate component and subsystem technologies which reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time for Earth observing instruments, platforms and information systems and, enable new Earth observation measurements.  This NRA solicits component and subsystem technologies for Earth observing instruments, including in-situ and remote instruments for surface, space-borne, and airborne measurements, that have the highest potential to meet the goals of the ACT program and the measurement capability requirements of the ESE. The ACT program is envisioned to be flexible enough to accept technology developments at various stages of maturity (entry TRL 2 to 4), and through appropriate risk reduction activities (such as requirements analysis, conceptual design, laboratory breadboards and pre-engineering models), advance the TRL of the component or subsystem.  Successful proposers must present innovative concepts which address key ESE science questions.  The ACT Program will competitively select proposals through a peer review process.  The total proposed period of performance should be at least one year and not exceed 36 months. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ACT Program to develop proposals and execute development and performance demonstrations of components and subsystems.  Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in component and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s).  This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide components and subsystems consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal.  Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks.  Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development.  Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule.  The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer's facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task.  The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  A single proposal may be submitted to more than one instrument team.  In all cases, the responder must indicate on the cover page of the proposal (not part of 5 page allocation) the applicable instrument team(s).  All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Brian D. Killough, Mail Stop 214, Building 1229, Room 120H, Hampton, VA 23681.  The preferred method of submission is via email to: b.d.killough@larc.nasa.gov.  The due date for submission is COB February 19, 2002.  Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2473, m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.  The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions is provided for each technology proposal: (1) Uncooled Infrared Detector Technologies Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Marty G. Mlynczak, 757-864-5695, m.g.mlynczak@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively planning and developing a variety of sensors to measure the Earth's radiation budget and climate, and the temperature, moisture, and chemical composition of the troposphere and stratosphere from space based satellites. The Center envisions developing a variety of Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) instruments to make these measurements and would like to introduce and develop the most advanced infrared detector technology into these instruments.  Specifically, NASA would like to develop sufficiently advanced infrared detectors that do not require active cooling by cryogenic devices whose presence places substantial demands on the power, lifetime, and mass, and thermal design of the sensor.  The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop infrared detector technology to meet a variety of needs. The particular requirements include: Spectral sensitivity: Wavelengths from 4 to 100 micrometers (mid- to far-infrared). Optical modulation frequency: 100 to 2000 Hz Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature: &lt; 200 milli-Kelvin for a 0.6 cm-1 spectral interval Specific Detectivity (D*): &gt; 1010cm Hz0.5 W-1 The technologies solicited include (but are not necessarily limited to) large format detector arrays (500 x 500 and greater), individual element detectors, and antenna coupled devices.  Partners selected under this synopsis would participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated NASA Advanced Component Technology Research Announcement. (2)  Fabry-Perot Interferometer Component Development Projects Technical Point of Contact: Dr. William B. Cook, (757)864-8331, w.b.cook@larc.nasa.gov The long-term objective of this effort is the development of new technology which enhances the effectiveness of Fabry-Perot etalon instruments for remote sensing applications.   For the ACTP we plan two projects:  1)  improving the sensitivity of an etalon-based spectrometer by developing novel detector technology which makes use of the unique properties of the etalon transmission function, and 2)  improving the throughput of an etalon by developing ways to use very large area reflecting surfaces.   Required areas of expertise are:  detector fabrication (IR and visible wavelengths) with the ability and interest in producing arrays with unusual geometries;  and employment of PZT-based control techniques of large etalons for spectral scanning and alignment.  Significant experience with construction and alignment of etalons is highly desirable for the second project. Potential ACTP partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide spectrometer subsystems and systems associated with Fabry-Perot interferometers in support of remote sensing applications.   They must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform some or all of the following tasks (note that not all tasks will be performed for both projects):  · Design and produce detector arrays meeting unusual geometrical specifications including the employment of elements of differing sizes within the same array, and elements with curved structure · Produce control and signal acquisition electronics for the prototype array detectors · Construct a large-diameter breadboard PZT-controlled etalon or system of etalons  · Model the performance of proposed etalon systems, especially the effects of natural and induced mechanical defects within the etalon · Develop and optimize control algorithms for etalons employing many (&gt;3) PZT spacers  · Analyze the results of laboratory measurements made using spectrometer systems incorporating the new components and techniques. (3)  Advanced 2 Microns Detector Development for Laser Remote Sensing Applications  Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Nurul Abedin, 757-864-4814, n.abedin@larc.nasa.gov Science Point of Contact: Dr. Syed Ismail, 757-864-2719, s.ismail@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is assembling a spread system to demonstrate DIAL/Lidar remote sensing instrument in the laboratory. The spread system will be designed to test instrument concepts and technology in preparation for the development of a flight instrument. This DIAL/Lidar instrument requires an advanced avalanche photodiode to operate at moderate temperatures and large area detection for long-term lidar remote sensing at 2 ?m and longer wavelengths.  The development of advanced avalanche photodiode will enhance the capabilities to study CO2 profiling and global winds, detect wind shear for airline safety, aerosol and cloud profiling, water vapor profiling, atmospheric pollutants monitoring (CO, etc.), and detection of a large number of species in the near and mid-IR using active and passive remote sensing techniques.  NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners from university and industry to develop large area photodetector with a 5 µm cutoff wavelength optimized for an operating temperature of -20o C. Establish the highest operating temperature such that the desired device will meet the minimum requirements shown below: ; Large Format (30 elements),  ; Collecting Area for each Element ~ 400 µm, ; Bandwidth ³ 5 GHz, ; Responsivity @ 2.00 µm ³ 60 A/W, ; Quantum efficiency @ 2.00 µm ³ 60%, and  ; Noise equivalent power £10 -14 W/ÖHz. (4)  Multi-Color Semiconductor Device Technology Development Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Nurul Abedin, 757-864-4814, n.abedin@larc.nasa.gov Science Point of Contact: Dr. Joseph M. Zawodny, (757) 864-2681, j.m.zawodny@larc.nasa.gov Multi-band imaging technologies are employed in a wide range of space-borne and air-borne applications for remote sensing. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Instrument is developed based-on multi-band detectors for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). This instrument is covering the range from 0.4 µm to 14.4 µm with 36 bands. A three bands imaging instrument is called Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) that will provide images from 0.4 - 14.6 µm with high spectral resolutions. In addition, Gas and Aerosol Monitoring Sensorcraft (GAMS) has three bands that will cover the range from 0.4 - 1.6 µm. Each of the spectral bands is used to monitoring earth and atmospheric constituents. NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners from university and industry to develop technology, such as multi-color detector arrays from 0.4 µm to 15 µm. The ultimate goal is to be able to integrate practically all of the electronics required into a single integrated circuit (I.C.). This I.C. should have a three-dimensional architecture with signal detection and processing function integrated. To realize the multi-color detectors, technique should be developed to grow device quality layers on any arbitrary substrates. The proposed goal of this study is to develop high quality multi-color devices such that the desired device will meet the following steps: ; Study Phase-evaluate options and identify preferred materials systems ; Evaluate different growth methods ; Material growth and evaluation ; Fabrication of devices and device characterization ; Final fabrication of multi-color detector arrays (5)  Lightweight Deployable Technologies for Synthetic Thinned Array Radiometry (STAR) Technical Point of Contact:  Jessica Woods-Vedeler, (757) 864-2829, j.a.woods-vedeler@larc.nasa.gov Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) has identified space-time variability of soil moisture, along with global precipitation as the highest priority science questions for their Post-2002 mission set in Hydrology and Mesoscale Weather.  A soil moisture measurement mission requiring 3 day repeat global mapping at 10 km spatial resolution has been identified as part of the Post-2002 mission set.  A large synthetic aperture microwave radiometer at L-Band is recognized as a candidate instrument concept for providing this measurement.   An aperture size of in the 30 m class is required to produce the 10 km spatial resolution over the full swath.   Lightweight deployment systems may provided the necessary "Packing Density" to enable a spacecraft concept which has the required aperture size while being consistent with nominal launch vehicles. Langley Research Center is seeking partners in the development of new lightweight boom technologies to enable the development of a 30-meter class Synthetic Thinned Array Radiometer (STAR) instrument.  The proposal will develop, new boom deployment concepts, receiver phase calibration technology, and integrated structural/receiver concepts to enable 30 meter class STAR arrays. Potential partners must demonstrate capabilities and experience in the development of advanced lightweight structures technology for space based applications.  They must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform one or more of the following tasks: ; Develop advanced deployment and packing concepts for lightweight spacecraft structures. ; Develop construction techniques and material selection to enable on orbit deployment of lightweight booms and survive long term exposure to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment. ; Fabricate and provide partial testing of test article to verify the structural and/or integrated structural-electromagnetic performance of the developed technology. ; Develop low power MMIC receiver front-end for L-band Integrated STAR Array. (6)  Hybrid-CCD linear detector array for the Near IR Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Joseph M. Zawodny, (757) 864-2681, j.m.zawodny@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center has an ongoing effort to advance technologies relating to space based remote sensing using the solar occultation technique. The Gas and Aerosol Monitoring Sensor (GAMS) team at Langley just completed an IIP investigation that demonstrated a silicon Hybrid-CCD linear array detector. Operating in the 400-1000nm spectral region, this detector boasts a 20 million electron full well with a pixel pitch of only 10 micrometers with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in excess of 14-bits. NASA Langley Research Center seeks partners from university and industry to develop materials and production techniques that result in detectors with similar performance while operating in the 1 to 6 micrometer spectral range. Individual detectors/materials may not need to operate over the full spectral range to prove useful, but they should cover at least a 3-micrometer portion of the spectral range. Other performance goals are as follows: ; 512 to 1024 element linear arrays,  ; pixel pitch less than 15 micrometers, ; High, relatively uniform QE, ; Large full well in excess of 16 million electrons, ; SNR greater than 14-bits at 200Hz operation including dark current and read noise. (7)  Ultra-lightweight telescope for space-based lidars Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Farzin Amzajerdian, (757) 864-1533, f.Amzajerdian@larc.nasa.gov NASA Earth Science Enterprise has identified several lidar remote sensing instruments for possible deployment in space over the next two decades.   Most of these lidar instruments are envisioned to use high-quality meter-class telescopes.  The telescope along with the laser transmitter is the driver of the total mass, size, and cost of these instruments.  Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the weight of the meter-class telescope in order to meet the programmatic constraints and remain affordable for space launch.    Furthermore, some of the lidar instruments require rotating the telescope, in order to scan the laser beam about the nadir, which imposes further constraints on the weight of the telescope.   While a number of methods for telescope weight reduction have been demonstrated, many of the current approaches rely on exotic materials and specialized manufacturing techniques that limit availability or substantially increase costs.  This proposed activity concentrates on advanced designs and novel fabrication techniques that can drastically reduce the telescope mass while allowing the use of commercial materials and equipment to keep the cost low.  (8)  Integrated Optical Heterodyne Receiver Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Farzin Amzajerdian, (757) 864-1533, f.Amzajerdian@larc.nasa.gov Micro fabrication of optical systems and integration of optical and electronic components at wafer level has recently attracted a great deal of attention within several industries such as telecommunication and data storage. We have recognized the potential of integrated opto-electronic technology in enabling low-cost, high efficiency, space-based coherent lidar instruments.  Coherent lidars are powerful instruments capable of meeting several NASA objectives that have been identified within the Earth Science, Aerospace Technology, and the Human Exploration and Development Enterprises.  NASA LaRC is seeking partners for the development of integrated opto-electronic receivers for coherent lidars operating in the near-IR region of spectrum centered about 2 micron wavelength with a bandwidth of several GHz. The Integrated Optical Heterodyne Receiver combines several of the lidar optical and electronic components on a single wafer.  These components include optical signal routing and conditioning optics, detectors, local oscillator diode laser, and electronic amplifiers and mixers. (9)  Tunable Optical Filter Technologies Technical Point of Contact:  Natalie Clark, (757) 864-5662, n.clark@larc.nasa.gov Hyperspectral imaging technologies are employed in a wide range of space-borne and air-borne applications for remote sensing. Other applications include mass spectroscopy and Gas and Aerosol Monitoring in which each  the spectral bands are used for monitoring earth and atmospheric constituents. Tunable optical filters offer the potential for a single instrument satisfying multiple needs. Moreover,  MOEMs (Optical Micro-Electro Mechanical) technologies offer advantages in size, weight, cost and power consumption. NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners from university and industry to develop MOEMs based  tunable optical filter  technologies -  especially  tunable Fabry Perot etalon that are  tunable in regions of the UV, visible and/or infrared spectrum. The ultimate goal is to be able to integrate practically all of the MOEMs device and electronics  required into a single multichip module. The proposed goal of this study is to develop high quality spectrally tunable devices such that the desired device will meet the following steps: ; Study Phase-evaluate options and identify preferred materials systems ; Evaluate different MOEMs processes  ; Fabrication of devices and device modeling and characterization ; Final fabrication of  arrays of MOEMs devices

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Ground Weapons Directorate, Anti-Armor Division, is in search of novel alternatives to range finding.  Candidate systems would primarily be used on the Follow-on to the Shoulder Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (FOTS), but could potentially be adapted to a variety of weapon platforms. The current Shoulder Launched Multi-purpose Assault Weapon uses a 9mm spotting rifle to accurately range the target, which leaves the gunner exposed for an unacceptable amount of time, and lacks functional reliability.  Potential replacement systems would be required to provide accurate and reliable ranges to targets < 500m in any weather condition including rain, snow, and fog as well as through battlefield obscurants where the operator can see the target with the naked eye.  The system would be required to be mounted on the FOTS or hand carried as a separate system. Cost, durability, and weight will all be considerations for a final system solution, however, information on or demonstrations of any novel alternatives or concepts are of great interest to the Marine Corps and are welcome at this time.  The technical POCs for this requirement are;  Maj Thad R. Trapp, SMAW/FOTS Project Officer, MARCORSYSCOM, (DSN) 278-2006 x2720 or (703) 784-2006 x2720 and Mr. Karl Solomon, Systems Engineer, Anti-Armor Division, MARCORSYSCOM, (DSN) 278-2006 x2726 or (703) 784-2006 x2726.

<DESC>NA TACOM-Rock Island is soliciting information from industry for Firing Mechanism components of the M198 Howitzer Breech Mechanism Assembly. They are a housing and a firing mechanism block.  The housing is a forging and the firing mechanism block can be eithe r machined out of solid stock or a casting.  Both items will require magnetic particle inspection per drawing B8769067, and solid film lubricant per drawing 8769470.  These two components take the brunt of the load from the chamber pressure that is applied  when the howitzer is fired. The Firing Mechanism components must meet the drawing requirements. The technical data package is available at: http://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOWandSPECS/index.htm.  This synopsis represents Market Research and the Government's  request for any firm to review the attached drawings and provide a price estimate, availability and delivery schedule to produce an estimated quantity of 185 each of these items. This buy is expected to be placed on a long-term contract and the quantity of 185 is the estimated quantity for the first year. The following information is solicited from industry: (1) Do you have a commer cial item (with or without minor modifications) that meets the stated requirements?  If yes, please provide a description of the item, delivery time, and its cost. Describe any modifications required. (2) Do you have experience/capability to perform any or all of the work above? Please identify the experience/capability, and delivery time. (3) What are the customary industry practices regarding warranty, buyer financing, discounts, distribution, packaging, and marking? (5) What are the customary practices regarding product testing? What types of tests are performed, and ho w often? (6) Does the TDP contain any requirements that you consider to be overly restrictive or that may inhibit effective competition? (8) What is your small business size status? (9) Provide an estimated lead-time to manufacture the estimated quantity s tated above. A Government manufacturing facility has only produced similar items previously. This synopsis does not constitute a commitment by the Government to place this effort on contract with anyone who submits data and costs. This synopsis does not co nstitute authorization to begin work or incur costs against this request. In accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Once t he information requested is received and evaluated, an acquisition strategy will be developed.

<SUBJECT>--Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project
<DESC>NA Pre-advertisement Contractor Meeting, proposed dredged material off-loader contract.  Description:  The Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project (HWRP) will restore approximately 1,000 acres of former Hamilton Army Airfield to tidal and seasonal wetlands.  The  project site is located adjacent to San Pablo Bay, City of Novato, Marin County, California.  Dredged material will be transported to the site to develop the wetlands.  It is estimated that 10.6 million cubic yards of dredged material will be placed at th e site from 2002 to 2009.  The dredged material will be from Federally authorized operations and maintenance projects and the Port of Oakland – 50 foot Deepening Project.  Dredged material from various permitted public and private dredging projects may als o be placed at the HWRP.  The combined annual total estimated quantity of dredged material to be transported to the HWRP could range from 1.5 MCY to 4.1 MCY.  The Corps is considering various contracting alternatives to accomplish this project.  An evaluat ion is being made of the benefits and acceptability of diesel versus electric shore power for the off-loader equipment operation.  Also, consideration is being given to having some of the pipeline and power supply equipment installed prior to issuance of t he off-loader contract to shorten the off-loader contract mobilization time.  Some of the potential alternatives are as noted herein.  Other phases of the HWRP are currently in the planning and design phases.  With the large quantity of pipe required the C orps of Engineers is considering the FY-02 issuance of an initial supply contract solicitation to acquire or acquire and install, approximately 24, 000 feet of 24” to 30” diameter pipeline that will run from the anticipated dredged material off-loader loca tion to the HWRP outboard marsh crossing.  The estimated cost is $1.5M to $3M.  It is anticipated that a construction contract solicitation will e issued early FY03 for the mobilization and operation of a dredged material off-loader and associated plant, p ipeline, power supply, etc.  The off-loader and associated equipment shall be capable of handling dredge material delivered by scows or hopper dredges.  This solicitation may be for a base period of one year with potential subsequent option years.  The max imum contract duration will likely be five years.  It has not yet been determined if this solicitation for providing and operating the off-loader will be issued as an RFP or IFB.  This procurement would be on a continuing contract basis with a potential es timated initial contract amount of $10M.  The estimated total HWRP cost is $60M.  The off-loader is planned to be located in San Pablo Bay at a location with water depths of 27’ MLLW.  The dredged material will need to be pumped a distance of 26,000’ to 34 ,000’ to the HWRP site.  The contractor will likely be responsible for HWRP site operation, including material distribution, water quality compliance, site dewatering, site monitoring, and other associated activities.  Additionally, the contractor may be r equired to accomplish restoration site dredged material cell construction and other earthwork, such as levees and berms.  The Corps of Engineers will conduct a pre-solicitation meeting on February 20, 2002, 10:30 a.m. to furnish contractors interested in t his work with a preliminary overview of the HWRP, anticipated scope of contracts and schedule.  The meeting will be held at the Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District in Conference Room 819 B, located at 333 Market Street, San Francisco, California.  C ontractors are encouraged to comment on the proposed contract schedule, requirements, and other issues of concern.  This can be done either at the meeting or by subsequent written comments.  A brief description of the project and supplemental details will be furnished to those firms requesting this information.  Please direct all requests to Ms. Linda Hales, Chief, of Contracting, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 33 3 Market Street, San Francisco, CA   94105.  Telephone number is (415)977-8553.
