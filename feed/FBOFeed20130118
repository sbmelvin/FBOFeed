It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a negotiated, Firm-Fixed Price incentive contract for an annual forest inventory data collection effort in North Dakota. The Contractor shall provide inventory data to the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Unit. This data will be collected from predetermined forest inventory plots randomly located across the state of North Dakota. The protocols for this effort including the inventory plot design are outlined and described in the "Forest Inventory and Analysis National Core Field Guide; Volume 1: Field Data Collection Procedures for Phase 2 Plots, Version 6.0" (commonly referred to as the "NRS FIA P2 Field Guide"). The current version of the "NRS FIA P2 Field Guide" serves as a reference document or instruction manual for the life of the contract and is subject to change in Option Periods 1 through 4.
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; and Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a period of approximately eleven (11) months (Base Period), with four (4) one-year (12-month) Option Periods to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, falls within the competitive price range. The contract period, including the Base Period, and four Option Periods (if exercised) will be from approximately April 2013 to February 2018. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. The evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance are: Factor 1 - Experience and Qualifications of Contractor and Key Personnel; Factor 2 - Past Performance; Factor 3 - Capability to Perform; and Factor 4 - Cost. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting; Factors 1, 2, and 3 are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract will be made as a whole to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered.</p>

Clearing and pruning of vegetation and removal of hazard trees along existing fence lines will be required. <br /><br />Water systems projects will likely consist of HDPE pipeline construction to include burying of pipeline, installation of related troughs, water storage tanks and plumbing, solar power systems, water well drilling or water well improvement. <br /><br />For the currently identified projects the typical terrain is remote, mountainous, and rugged. Certain projects will require livestock packing of equipment and supplies and camping for extended periods in remote, sometimes roadless areas, including along or near the international border with Mexico and in federally designated wilderness areas. The project areas contain existing structures that will require removal and proper disposal off-site. Most areas have been affected or will be affected during the term of the contract by wildfire that has destroyed or damaged the existing structures. The scope of this contract may also include new construction and will often include government furnished property. <br /><br />This acquisition is being restricted to qualified HUBZone firms with official business offices in the states of Arizona and New Mexico. In order to qualify a HUBZone firm must be on the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns listed on the Small Business Administration (SBA) website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone.

Task Orders awarded from this contract will range between $2,000 and $250,000. Task Orders may fluctuate below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. In no event shall an individual task order exceed $650,000.
<p>The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through the issuance of a task order. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered. There is a minimum guarantee of $5,000 during the performance period of the contract.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize the best value source selection process with the intent to award a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of three (3) IDIQ contracts to the responsible proposer(s) whose proposal(s), conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is most advantageous to the Government. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.<br />&nbsp;<br />Discussions may be initiated if the number of acceptable proposals as per the evaluation criteria in the RFP requires the establishment of a competitive range. The government reserves the right to award no contract when no acceptable proposals are received or less than three contracts if not enough acceptable proposals are received from qualified HUBZone firms with designated offices in Arizona or New Mexico.<br />&nbsp;<br />All USDA Forest Service units in Arizona and New Mexico, especially those impacted by wildfire, are able and encouraged to place orders on the ensuing contract(s) under the same terms and conditions and the appropriate local Davis Bacon wage determination.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application.

<RESPDATE>010113
<CONTACT>Brandon Whittier, Contract Specialist, Phone 630-252-4614, Fax 630-252-5045, Email brandon.whittier@ch.doe.gov - Marlene E. Martinez, Contracting Officer, Phone 630-252-2080, Fax 630-252-5045, Email Marlene.Martinez@ch.doe.gov
<DESC><p>The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a sole source contract with Michael D. Holland Consulting for technical services under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source. The approximate contract period of performance is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The estimated level of effort is 480 hours for the base year, with no option years included. The estimate of the cost for the base year is $80,000 plus DOE authorized travel expenses.</p>
<p>The work areas that the contractor is responsible to perform include translating recently identified B3019 security concerns and potential organizational and mission related vulnerabilities into actionable and corrective federal measures. Such services will include, but not be limited to, reviewing recent DOE investigations and reports related to B3019 security concerns, supporting DOE's preparation of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP), and presenting results to senior leadership within the Department. One such recent report contains classified information that requires assistance from individual(s) with appropriate need to know and security clearance(s) at the Q level. Additionally, this work requires substantial and unique understanding of DOE's roles and responsibilities, particularly as they relate to its locations and federal organizations within Oak Ridge, TN. Accordingly, DOE intends to use these services to assist in the determination of appropriate corrective measures, to assist in oversight and verification of the corrective action implementation, and otherwise advise senior DOE leadership in related matters. In establishing the minimum requirements for this effort, DOE identified the following criteria deemed essential to meet its requirements:</p>
<p>1) Immediate availability.<br />2) Experience demonstrating an understanding of SC's management structure and culture.<br />3) Experience demonstrating an understanding of the Office of Science management approach including its use of the Office of Science Management System (SCMS).<br />4) Experience demonstrating an understanding of the detailed roles, responsibilities, authorities and accountabilities of Office of Science Site Offices and Support Offices.<br />5) Experience demonstrating an understanding of project management systems with regard to organizational structure, schedules, resource requirements, and integration.<br />6) Possess a working knowledge of DOE Human Resources including incentives.<br />7) Experience in working with organizations to solve cultural issues.<br />8) Possess a working knowledge of the DOE security requirements, including and specifically those for Level 1 Safeguarded Facilities.<br />9) Experience demonstrating knowledge of DOE contracts.<br />10) Independence from any of the federal line management organizations supporting the security function for B3019 (i.e. had not previously served in a permanent position).<br />11) Possessed a DOE Q clearance within the past year.<br />12) Recent experience (no more than one year removed) managing a large SC Management and Operating Contract.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this award is 41 USC 253(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Michael D. Holland Consulting has highly specialized personnel who are uniquely qualified to perform this requirement in accordance with the above stated criteria deemed necessary to accomplish this work. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered by January 1, 2013 to: Mr. Brandon Whittier, Contract Specialist, 9800 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, Illinois 60439, or via email to brandon.whittier@ch.doe.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541611. Businesses who believe they have a superior solution to DOE's proposed award to Michael D. Holland Consulting must respond in writing to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>The written response must include a general technical proposal for performing services mentioned in this announcement, past performance client information for similar work within 3 years, resumes of individuals with relevant professional qualifications who would be potentially assigned to the work and a rationale as to why your solicitation would be in the Government's best interest. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

The Fort Harrison VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide investigative services, construction documents, working drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and construction administration period services as required for the design allowing for upgrades to the medical gas systems within the VA medical center located in Fort Harrison Montana.  The Medical Gas system has reached useful life.  Systems are not fully compliant to NFPA codes.  The reliability and ability to maintain and repair alarm systems and other controlling components has decreased due to the age of the system.  The nitrous-oxide system has significantly exceeded useful life.  The primary purposes of these upgrades are to replace master med-gas alarm panels, evaluate and address monitoring stations and zone control stations, replace water cooled vacuum pumps, replace medical air compressors, and replace nitrous-oxide system.  The expectation will be for the design to provide corrections to all deficiencies noted and to provide for construction planning which eliminates service outages as much as possible.  
The submitted SF330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;

(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;

(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;

(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and

(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.

<DESC>Introduction:<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT FOR FUTURE ACTION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.<br />This RFI is being issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. The subject RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any Contractors', Consortia, or Research Institutions' ability to submit an offer if, or when, an acquisition solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. <br />There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI or attendance at the site visit. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<br />Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information / details based on their initial submittals. The Government reserves the right to select one, some, or none of the submissions for further investigation. Contractors who submit information in response to this RFI do so with the understanding that U.S. Government personnel as well as their support Contractors may review their material and or data.<br />Requirements:<br />The Air Force seeks to provide for rapid transition of medical products and capabilities from the laboratory to the field through minor modifications and enhancements that integrate Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and near-COTS products available in industry into the military operating environment. Efforts will include expanding existing fielded systems to enable the detection, identification, and quantification of health hazards; modify existing commercial technology to provide enhanced care capabilities both in theater and in garrison; and enhance current technology for treatment of illness or injury thereby substantially improving treatment and outcomes. The Air Force will capitalize on existing COTS/near-COTS solutions to provide for patient warming and cooling; detect, identify and quantify naturally occurring microbial volatile organic compounds in water, soil and air that pose a health hazard to operators / occupants; provide multiple channel wound evacuation; and deliver optimized patient warming and cooling capabilities to patients and providers through means that are available in the market now. <br />To meet these needs the Air Force will leverage highly mature technology with a demonstrable potential for military application, but require minor modifications in order to meet military unique mission requirements and rapidly transition these to the field. The ability to utilize enhanced or modified COTS (mCOTS) solutions to meet Air Force operational requirement is a cost effective approach to meeting mission requirements. If implemented, this program will be maximized to ensure war fighters have the appropriate technology at hand to care for the wounded at the point of injury through definitive care and on to rehabilitation/reintegration at the best cost and schedule to the taxpayer and Air Force operational community.<br />Instructions:<br />The 773 ESS/PKJ requests feedback from interested parties through the following questionnaire link: http://www.mcix.com/RDTE<br />A PDF version of this questionnaire is included as an attachment to this announcement to allow viewing of the entire questionnaire before taking the on-line version. Responses will be collected via the online questionnaire only. DO NOT submit the PDF document in response to the RFI request.<br />If unable to complete this questionnaire in one sitting, you may close the questionnaire window and re-open the questionnaire link to edit your response. The questionnaire will start from the beginning, but will show the responses previously entered. This only works if returning to the questionnaire from the original computer (IP address) used initially. All responses are collected based on IP addresses; only one response per IP address is permitted. This edit process will not work if you try to use a different computer to complete your response.<br />In the questionnaire, all questions followed by an (*) require a response to continue with the questionnaire. The CAGE code is the only question that does not require a response as the Air Force recognizes that not all companies will have one assigned.<br />Note that official information concerning this RFI will be provided by the Contracting Officer only. If you experience trouble with this link, please contact the 773/ESS/PKJ, TSgt Jeffrey Wysocky at Jeffrey.Wysocky@wpafb.af.mil or 937-257-0267. <br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br />General Information:<br />Given the rapid pace of new technology development, evolution of existing technologies and high costs associated with long-term new technology development for military missions, it is imperative that the Air Force leverage commercial sector advances in technology development for employment in Air Force operations whenever possible. Proving the readiness of candidate commercial products and capabilities for adaptation to military use will be an important aspect of consideration under any potential procurement action.<br />DoD Instruction 5000.2 and the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG: acc.dau.mil) provide guidance for maturity assessment based on Technology Readiness Levels, defined as follows:<br />RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: activities that most likely occur in a basic laboratory setting, prior to identification of a sponsoring organization.<br />TRL 1, Basic principals observed and reported.<br />TRL 2, Technology concept and/or application formulated.<br />TRL 3, Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept.<br />TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION: activities that occur as a result of funding provided by a sponsoring organization.<br />TRL 4, Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.<br />TRL 5, Component and/or breadboard validation in a relevant environment.<br />TRL 6, System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.<br />PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT: activities that occur once the technology has been transferred from the sponsoring organization to the customer or end user.<br />TRL 7, System prototype demonstration in an operational environment (prototype near, or at, planned operational system).<br />TRL 8, Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration (technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions).<br />TRL 9, Actual system proven through successful mission operations (actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions).<br />For those interested in a more detailed understanding of TRL calculations and assessment, including relationships with manufacturing and program readiness, the following document is available for download:<br />Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Readiness Level Calculator (ver 1.1), Final Report and User's Manual, 30 September 2009: http://www.homelandsecurity.org/docs/reports/DHS_ST_RL_Calculator_report20091020.pdf <br />This document includes use of the AFRL TRL Calculator as a baseline tool.<br />For reference, see also:<br />Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02, December 8, 2008; Enclosure 2; Section 5; Technology Development Phase: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500002p.pdf <br />Memorandum for Component Acquisition Executives: Improving Technology Readiness Assessment Effectiveness (May 11, 2011); https://acc.dau.mil/adl/en-US/445970/file/57409/TRA%202011.pdf.<br />These and related downloads are also available from Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG); https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=337952<br />PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSISTING A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF TRL PRINCIPALS AS RELATES TO TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION ACTIVITIES.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br /><br /><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</strong> <strong>PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. </strong>
<p><br />This RFI is being issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any Contractor's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The subject RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<br /><br />Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. The Government reserves the right to select, one, some, or none of the submissions for further investigation. Contractors who submit information in response to this RFI do so with the understanding that U.S. Government personnel as well as their support Contractors may review their material and or data.</p>
<p><strong>General Information:<br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, may be asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closure (SC) through remedial action at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; This project is primarily construction under NAICS 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services. <br /><br />Attachments to this RFI reflect Request for Proposal (RFP) Number FA8903-13-R-0040 which may be used should this requirement be advertised at a future date.&nbsp; <br /><br />Project Narrative:<br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB is considering a performance-based approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott&nbsp;AFB in Illinois.&nbsp;Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) emphasizes results in terms of environmental clean-up for an entire installation (fence-to-fence), or group of installations, in lieu of a study-based approach. The PBR approach looks for technically and cost-effective methods for achieving this clean-up by focusing on achievement of desired objectives without specifying the processes or technologies for obtaining those objectives. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The POP is estimated at 120 months (10 years) from date of award. The estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) anticipated for any resultant contract is between $38,000,000 and $48,000,000. This ROM is an estimate range only and is provided only for informational purposes of responding to the RFI. <br /><br /><strong>Request for Information:<br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB requests feedback from interested parties through the following survey link: <strong>www.mcix.com/PBR.<br /><br /></strong>The above link will direct you to the online questionnaire. For your convenience, there is a PDF document that has all the questions so you and your company can review prior to starting the online questionnaire. You will need to have information such as your company's DUNs number, basic employee data, revenue data, etc. for the past 3 fiscal tax years (or as best approximated). The PDF document is for reference only and only the on-line submission will be accepted. The online questionnaire will be the source tool for gathering responses, please use the best available information or estimates. If you need to stop the survey during any time, you will be able to resume your session using the same computer from which you started.&nbsp; Note that official information concerning this RFI will be provided by the Contracting Officer only.<br /><br />Additional information is also provided for your review to assist in completing the RFI survey. The following documents are included as uploaded attachments to this notice: DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO), dated 16 Jan 2013; DRAFT SOO Enclosure 1, Site List, dated 16 Jan 2013; DRAFT SOO Enclosure 2, Key Documents List, dated 17 Jan 2013; DRAFT SOO Enclosure 5, Acronyms and Definitions, dated 16 Jan 2013; Estimated Bonding Stream; Labor Category Qualifications.</p>

<DESC>16 January 2013 <br>  <br> Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis: Energy Efficient Tent Systems <br>  <br> 1.  INTRODUCTION: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice for planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the PM FSS will take procurement action in this matter.  This RFI notice is being issued for the purpose of assessing industries' current capabilities in providing energy efficient tent systems for use by military services in various theaters of operations.  Any information provided does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas. Neither Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  <br> 2.  BACKGROUND: The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These base camps are heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.   <br>  <br> 3.  PURPOSE: PM FSS is interested in learning what commercial tent systems are available today that enhance the operational energy efficiency and logistics sustainability of expeditionary soft wall tent systems. This RFI focuses on technologies and equipment that addresses operational energy efficiency in soft wall tents. Information received and any product assessment made from this RFI will be used to identify technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing energy-related base camp operations.  The current concepts of use for these Energy Efficient Tent Systems will be to support expeditionary type missions. Primary functional uses of these tents will be as billeting, dining, office configurations, and personnel hygiene facilities.   Soft wall tent systems of interest are those that would most effectively reduce the operational energy demand of a base camp supporting 150 personnel and smaller.  These same technologies will be considered for base camps supporting 600 personnel and greater.   <br>  <br> 4.

<CONTACT>Sherry Rowlett, Email sherry.rowlett@fda.hhs.gov - Jennifer Fagan, Contracting Officer, Email jennifer.fagan@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>Request for Information</p>
<p><br />From: Food &amp; Drug Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br />Subject: Common Budget Tracking System (CBTS) -Center for Drug Evaluation (CDER) <br />Date: January 18, 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT AN OFFER. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY ANY COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION OF ANY SUBMISSION TO THIS NOTICE, OR TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the market availability, functional and technical of solutions, and the Commercial of The Shelf (COTS) products and services capable of satisfying the business, functional, technical, and operational characteristics of available tools that can function as a Common Budget Tracking System as described in this RFI.</p>
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's evaluation of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this RFI with any interested parties. <br />I. General Requirements. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is a division of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that monitors most drugs as defined in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The center reviews applications for new and generic pharmaceuticals, manages US current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for pharmaceutical manufacturing, determines which medications require a medical prescription, monitors advertising of approved medications, and collects and analyzes safety data about pharmaceuticals that are already on the market. CDER reviews New Drug Applications to ensure that the drugs are safe and effective. Its primary objective is to ensure that all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications are safe and effective when used as directed. The FDA's budget for approving, labeling, and monitoring drugs is roughly $290 million per year. The safety team monitors the effects of more than 3,000 prescription drugs on 200 million people with a budget of about $15 million a year. <br />II. Centralized Budget Tracking System The standard accounting system in use by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration is known internally as Unified Financial Management System (UFMS), and is known commercially as Oracle Federal Financials. However, CDER Offices, Divisions, Branches and Teams with budget authority currently track expenditures through a variety of tools and templates such as in MS Excel and Access. Considerable staff time is devoted to the creation, maintenance and reconciliation of these "home-grown" tools. Errors are more likely since updates are manually added, and not in synchronization with disbursements or changes reflecting actual spend. Centralized monitoring of allocations and expenditures would improve budget management, especially in years where Congress has provided a shorter period of time for obligations.</p>
<p>Because of these concerns, CDER is considering implementing a Centralized Budget Tracking System. Any Centralized Budget Tracking System should have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide access to historical data at the Office, Division, Branch and Team levels of budget authority for reporting purposes;<br />&bull; Track all changes that are made by each user to foster user accountability;<br />&bull; Provide role-based access to data, with the ability to change information based on authority and responsibility;<br />&bull; Provide reasonable system speed, access, screen refreshes, and processing during times when multiple users are in the system;<br />&bull; Have the ability to receive a "push" of information from UFMS when updates are made. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br />o Travel funding changing from order estimates to voucher disbursements<br />o Projected obligations on purchase cards when purchases are made versus when bills are reconciled<br />o Track requisitions as they move from obligations to commitments to disbursements<br />&bull; Must be compatible with Oracle Federal Financials software reports, including formatting (currency, object class code, fields, etc.) consistent with Oracle Federal Financials<br />&bull; Must conform to FDA/HHS security and infrastructure requirements. Please see http://www.hhs.gov/policies/hhsar/subpart352.html#Subpart352.2--TextsofProvisionsandClauses for minimum requirements.<br />&bull; Must contain all current fields in Excel and decide which are necessary, including tagging and comments<br />&bull; Must have the capability to sort by line items and category<br />o Sort by system (UFMS, IMPAC, Transfers, ORISE, Taps)<br />o Sort by module (e.g. Purchase Card: outstanding, actual, paid/not paid, partial payment field, travel, etc.)<br />o Decision tree, open and close mechanism<br />o Ability to track and sort projections by line item<br />o Ability to add line items<br />o Pull-down menu for object classes or any frequently-used codes. This field should be able to be updated.<br />o Pull-down menu to label travel by object classes (e.g., conference, foreign, sponsor, domestic) to enable entry and reporting<br />o Must track all types of operating money: grants, payroll center accounting number (CAN), operating center accounting number (CAN), and pivot table<br />o Must be able to see sections within a division - from sub-team to super office level<br />&bull; Must provide various levels of access rights, including proxy entries. <br />&bull; Must have the ability to enter initial allocations and internal and external transfers with the ability to amend.<br />&bull; Must be able to distinguish between different funding sources.<br />&bull; Must have report design and running capabilities<br />o Ability to answer both ad hoc and routine report request without rework<br />o Any system must be able to generate reports with data obtained from Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition<br />&bull; Must be able to highlight any entry and see all details <br />&bull; Must be able to highlight any entry and see an explanation/comment field<br />&bull; Must have automatic generation of the next P# (Project Codes) using the same numbers as UFMS/Oracle Federal Financials (D#, GIF#)<br />&bull; Must flag differences and errors</p>
<p>III. Instructions: Interested parties shall submit the following information along with other documentation that would help the FDA better understand the functional capabilities of available products/solutions.</p>
<p>1) Provide information on the COTS component(s) that might make up the overall CBTS solution. Include information on application compatibility, including supporting database management systems; hardware and operating systems; architecture; client architecture (such as web-based, client/server); support for handheld devices; performance impact; and scalability. Include information on the product's ability to interface and integrate with other FDA systems. Also include an overview of the COTS Software's ability to meet regulatory standards such as 21 CFR Part 58, 21 CFR Part 11, etc.</p>
<p>2) Provide a narrative overview of the COTS software's ability to support the core features, functions, data, and reporting needs of CBTS identified above. Please specify any functional areas that may require extensions or customization of COTS software. Also describe any CBTS components that may need to be or should be custom built. Include a brief rationale for any custom built components.</p>
<p><br />3) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). The ROM should take into account software licenses to support several hundred to several thousand users.</p>
<p>4) Explain whether or not your product adheres to Section 508 Accessibility Requirements which requires Federal agencies to ensure that individuals with disabilities who are members of the public or Federal employees have access to and use of electronic and information technology (EIT) that is comparable to that provided to individuals without disabilities. See http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm for more information.</p>
<p>5) Provide information concerning contract vehicles available to be used by the FDA in acquiring your product (GSA Federal Schedules, Government-wide Acquisition Contract, SmartBuy, etc.).</p>
<p>6) On the FACE PAGE of your submittal, please list the following information:</p>
<p>a. Organization Name<br />b. Name, email address, telephone number and mailing address of primary point of contact<br />c. Organization Address, Telephone/Fax number<br />d. Organization website<br />e. Number of employees in organization<br />f. Organization's current and gross revenue<br />g. Organization's business size status (small or other than small business)<br />h. Socio-economic status (small business, SDB, 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HubZone, etc.)</p>
<p><br />7) Please suggest an appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and rationale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Please submit responses to this RFI in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>1) A submittal not to exceed five (5) pages (excluding transmittal page) that, at a minimum, addresses each of the topics described in the Instructions section; <br />2) Submit your response via email to sherry.rowlett@fda.hhs.gov <br />3) Deadline for responses is 12:00 P.M. ET on 31 January, 2013; <br />4) Mark your response as "Proprietary Information" if the information is considered business sensitive.</p>

<DESC>NASA HQ is hereby soliciting information about potential 8(a) sources for professional support services and information technology support on behalf of the NASA Research and Education Support Services (NRESS) program that supports the agencys peer review life cycle. Research, technology development, and education program proposals submitted to NASA are customarily peer-reviewed  before receiving funding through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or intergovernmental agreements funded by the aeronautics, human exploration, science, space technology, and education Mission Directorates.  Proposal solicitation mechanisms include NASA Research Announcements (NRAs), Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), and Cooperative Agreement Notices (CANs). The Agencys peer review life cycle, for purposes of NRESS requirements, consists of the following general processes: (1) development of solicitations and collection of proposals; (2) competitive peer review of proposals; and (3) disposition of proposals following proposal review and prior to award.  All decisions about proposals selected for award are made by NASA selection officials and all awards are made by authorized NASA procurement and federal assistance personnel with appropriate warrants. The NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), a web-based information technology system, enables users authorized by NASA to announce research, technology development, and specialized education program opportunities to the public.  NSPIRES also enables intramural and extramural researchers and other stakeholders to view announcements and submit electronic proposals.  NSPIRES facilitates proposal review, analysis, and evaluation, as well as proposal disposition.  Refer to http://nspires.nasaprs.com     for an orientation to the NSPIRES system.  NSPIRES also interfaces with the Federal e-government system, grants.gov. Peer reviews evaluate a proposals relevance, its merit, and costs.  Specific peer review methods differ among NASA program offices, and even among disciplines within a given program office.  Some offices use standing review committees, ad hoc committees, or a combination of these for individual announcements. Peer reviewers include scientists, engineers, educators, or others from public and private academic institutions, industry, Government laboratories and agencies, and foreign countries.  Criteria for selection of peer reviewers include the research that candidates have conducted, their publications, knowledge and experience, and their ability to conduct an impartial review.  NASA and the contractor supporting the NRESS program maintain databases of discipline experts to facilitate the identification and selection of reviewers.  Reviewers are sometimes chosen based on recommendations of former reviewers or other professional colleagues.  Proposal reviews by external peers ensures fresh viewpoints, alternative perspectives, and understanding of the state of art. Proposal reviews usually occur at panel meetings (either in person or via video or telecom) and are customarily preceded by reviewers written evaluations (e.g., compiled and stored in the NSPIRES web interface).  Panel and sub-panel teams are usually composed of seven to ten specialists in relevant disciplines or sub-disciplines.  Rarely a large panel might include up to 40 individuals.  All panel proceedings, including findings, opinions, working papers, and recommendations are confidential.  A proposals author never participates in its review or reviews directly competing proposals.  All reviewers are screened to ensure that they have no conflict of interest in the proposals they review. The NRESS contractor will provide professional services that support the Agencys peer review life cycle.  Services provided will include supporting the development and announcement of solicitations; and collecting, organizing, compiling, and disseminating proposals to peer reviewers.  The contractor will facilitate the selection and recruitment of reviewers.  The contractor will manage the staging of review and panel events, lead the evaluation and selection of venues, fulfill panelists travel, lodging, and per diem requirements, and reimburse panelists expenses.  The contractor will provide and support all electronic tools needed to conduct panel events and support mail-in reviews.  The contractor will support all review and panel close-out activities, including supporting the development and dissemination of post-selection communications to proposers, their institutions, and to NASA stakeholders.  The contractor will maintain records of events, secure proposal databases, and will support data analysis related to Agency peer review. The NRESS contractor must be capable of operating, maintaining, and sustaining a highly dependable World Wide Web-based (WWW) system, (NSPIRES), that announces solicitations; collects electronic Notices of Intent (NOI) and proposals; facilitates online proposal review and evaluation; and processes proposals electronically prior to award.  The contractor will provide comprehensive information technology program management and operations for the system and its interfaces (such as interfaces to grant.gov). Information technology services required will include those related to enhancing or replacing the system in response to functional user requirements or marketplace developments.  The contractor will provide user access and account provisioning services; help desk services and related customer support; user training materials; and job aids. The contractor will develop and maintain comprehensive systems documentation, as well as information technology security, appropriate protective controls, and risk management. The contractor will provide for and assure continuous operations in the event of system outages. The government anticipates requesting the NRESS Contractor to complete a study to upgrade or replace the current NSPIRES system. Interested businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses and non-8(a) small businesses which meet the size standard provided below, are requested to provide their name, location, size of business, average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees, ownership, and capability statement of 10 pages or less providing detailed information demonstrating their technical understanding and ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein, to include their qualifications, capabilities, experience, and past performance history. It is anticipated that a Cost type contract will be issued with a five year period of performance.  The NAICS code for this action is 56110 and the size standard is $7 million. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted by the response date listed above to Danit Rainey via email.  Please reference Request for Information Number 2013-NRESS-RFI in any response. The expected release time frame for any RFP is the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

This acquisition is conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) Soliciting from a Single Source. The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available due to only one responsible source and no other service will satisfy agency requirements. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 332311 - Prefabricated Metal Building and Component Manufacturing a size standard of $500. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt intends to make award on a sole source basis to LCOR Incorporated for planned emergency generator system maintenance services. This notice is for a 5 year justification other than full and open competition (JOFOC) for the Financial Management Service (FMS), Philadelphia Regional Financial Center facility for planned emergency generator system maintenance services. The lessor is responsible for the operation of the FMS building located at 13000 Townsend Road, Philadelphia, PA in accordance with (Lease No. GS-03B-30060, Lease Part 5-7) for planned emergency generator system maintenance services. The planned emergency generator system maintenance services involve work that is tied to or physically connected to equipment that is under control of the lessor. Contracting with the lessor will insure the lessor remains responsible for the continued maintenance and operation of the systems. The use of an outside contractor would negate the lessor's responsibility for errors or damage that might occur.&nbsp;
<p>BPD will consider written responses received no later than 12:00PM Noon ET on Thursday, January 24, 2013 to psb3@bpd.treas.gov. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing alterations to the FMS Building. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned<br />deadline, BPD shall make award on a sole source basis to LCOR Incorporated.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source, fixed price purchase order to Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, Massachusetts, to prepare and analyze data from the Nurses' Health Study II (NGS2) to determine if job strain and rotating shift work contribute to weight gain. The contractor will use the data obtained from the NGS2, an ongoing cohort study of 116,430 registered nurses. BWH researchers have exclusive access to the data gathered under the NGS2 and no other data base has the large sample size and the specific data variables needed. Additional information about this effort is found in the attached Statement of Work. <br /><br />This procurement action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov, (formerly known as Central Contractor Registry (CCR) www.ccr.gov), prior to an award of a federal contract. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/ response must be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov by COB February 02, 2013.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for information for impact analysis for the potential upgrade of Ice Melt/De-Icer from C-List to B-List on the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
<SOLNBR>CP-01-18-13-01

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential upgrade of the following products on the PL.  The Defense Logistics Agency is currently authorized under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act to procure the items listed below for the Department of Defense.  The potential action described in this Notice will authorize the Defense Logistics Agency to procure these items for the entire federal government.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1946<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 10 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing compound. UoI is BX. BX = 10 lbs.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1926<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 20 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing 				compound. UoI is BX. BX = 20 lbs.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-598-1933<br />Name:		Ice Melt/De-Icer, 40 lbs.<br />Description:	Granular ice melt pre-coated with chemicals to create a corrosive deicing compound. UoI is BX. BX = 40 lbs.</p>
<p>Should these items be upgraded from C-List to B-List, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency, Richmond, VA.<br /> <br />Before upgrading products from C-List to B-List, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once upgraded, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			6850-01-598-1946<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	TL1-G1907245; SCW10BRR; 70869; 81040; 30069</p>
<p>NSN:			6850-01-598-1926<br />ETS Stock Numbers: A43074; 374926A; 765784; 713197-56850</p>
<p>NSN:			6850-01-598-1933<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7930-01-412-0984; TL1-G1894768; TL1-G1990984; TL1-G2466645; TL1-G2006122; ICE SS6040; 7481328; 60578; 81050; 7204290; ICE PREM-50BX; NOR KO56551; ICE SUP-50BG; ICE WS-50BX</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 4, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be upgraded on the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-01-372-3102<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Letter Size, 1 Divider, 4 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 1 divider, 4 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1098<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Letter Size, 2 Dividers, 6 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, letter size, 2 dividers, 6 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners. 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point Type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1099<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Legal Size, 1 Divider, 4 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 1 divider, 4 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1100<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Legal Size, 2 Dividers, 6 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 2 dividers, 6 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN<br />ETS Stock Numbers:<br />NSN:			7530-01-372-3102<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59251; SMD-65105</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1098<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59252; SMD-65115</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1099<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59351; SMD-65155</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1100<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59352; SMD-65165</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 4, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

FHFA is also the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These institutions play critical roles in supporting the nation's housing finance system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and hold mortgages and MBS for investment. The Federal Home Loan Banks lend money to banks and other financial institutions using mortgages as collateral and also invest in mortgage-related assets. FHFA's mission is to ensure that these institutions operate in a safe and sound manner so that they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. The FHFA's annual procurement expenditures are approximately $55 million; with the top spend categories primarily in the following NAICS codes: 531120, 541110, 541611, 541511, 541513, and 423430.</p>

<p>Sole Source:<br />The NDBC is implementing a technology refresh of existing TAO Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array program stations. In the program development, NDBC led a sources sought effort to acquire a vendor to supply various sensors that use serial and inductive modem communications. Sea-Bird Electronics was the only responder and thus was selected to supply serial and inductively coupled salinity, temperature, and pressure sensors and recorders for the profiled array on climate quality platforms and the TAO project. The new TAO refresh system was designed around these sensors. This includes the hardware and software interfaces including shoreside processing. The TAO refresh system was commissioned by the NDBC in 2010 and the NDBC is implementing the conversion. <br />Consistency I n the behavior of these ocean monitoring sensors over time is critical to the long term study of the parameters being monitored. The temperature/pressure sensor must be able to maintain the same accuracy and resolution as the previous sensors used on these projects. As the manufacturer of the previous sensor used in the TAO array, Sea-Bird Electronics is the only known source of supply to meet this requirement.</p>

<a href="mailto:Steve_LeBel@nps.gov">Deputy Associate Regional Director</a>
<DESC>Pursuant to the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, Public Law 105-391, the Director of the National Park Service may award non-competitive temporary concession contracts for consecutive terms not to exceed three years in the aggregate.
Through a lease held by National Park Foundation, the National Park Service (Service) has provided non-motorized boat rental and storage services in Rock Creek Park on the Georgetown Waterfront since transferred from the District of Columbia to the National park Service in 1999. 
The Service anticipates awarding a temporary concession contract for non-motorized boat rental and storage services.  The Service may award one temporary concession contract and by law, the term of temporary concession contract may be one year, two years, or three years or any combination thereof, but not to exceed 3 years.
The National Capital Region (NCR) issues this REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ) to determine if an interested operator is qualified to provide non-motorized boat rental and storage services as described in the draft Temporary Concession Contract, including all Exhibits, that accompanies this RFQ.  The Service is issuing this RFQ to obtain information about the experience and financial capability of entities seeking to provide the non-motorized boat rental and storage services.  While responses do not constitute offers, the Service plans to rely, in part, on the information provided as a basis for selecting the temporary concessioner.  The prospectus and a synopsis of the business opportunity will be available on the National Park Service Concessions website at:  <http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm>
This RFQ does not constitute a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP), nor does this RFQ constitute an offer, either expressed or implied.

<DESC>I.	Introduction <br>  <br> Assistant Project Manager Training Devices (APM TRADE), in support of the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), is seeking industry participation, support, and feedback on the instantiation and sustainment of Live Training standards.  This is an opportunity for industry to provide knowledge, insight, and direction in shaping and tempering Live Training standards to align with industry best practices.  Industry participation is paramount to future training endeavors as these standards shall become common elements across Live Training architectures and programs and be interoperable with Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) overarching vision. <br>  <br> The PM TRADE paradigm, which encompasses the Live Training domain, is focused on developing standards and leveraging common components in order to provide inherent interoperabilities as principal underlying architectures, such as the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), continue to be matured.  Developing and implementing Live Training standards appropriately allows for improvements in the support for various mission programs and external efforts, direction of product-line configuration management, and organization of sustainment efforts. <br>  <br> The intent of the Live Training standards working group is to facilitate a vendor-neutral approach and make allowances for standalone, scalable changes to systems that are transparent to the consumer.  They will also allow for a common solution to be implemented at all sites and be interoperable with any vendor's standard-compliant system, thus deterring the creation of stovepipe systems.  The implementation and usage of the Live Training standards reduce total ownership costs, while allowing improved ability to leverage industry products and evolve as technology improves.  As such, these standards will be utilized in future Requests for Proposals (RFPs). <br>  <br> This working group session is only one in a number of working groups that shall be scheduled to address various Live Training standards.  This working group session is planned to update industry on the recent changes to current standards and address the Instrumentation System Tactical Engagement Simulation System (IS-TESS) standard.  The workshop is scheduled for 5 and 6 March, 2013 at the U.S. Army PEO STRI, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, Florida 32826.  The specific building is Partnership III, room 321 A/B. <br>  <br> Once we receive initial feedback as to the number interested in participating, an updated agenda and any other pertinent information will be emailed to the interested participants, NLT 19 February 2013. <br>  <br> Please note that space may be limited, so be sure to respond early if you plan to attend. <br>   <br> II.	Agenda <br>  <br>  	Day 1:   <br>  	Provide status on the Audio Visual Cueing Standard, Power and Placement Standard, and the Multifunctional Vehicle Port Standard. <br>  	Provide results of a study on extending the Live Personal Area Network (L PAN) standard, to include Bluetooth and/or Bluetooth Low Energy. <br>  	Discuss APM TRADE's perceived issues regarding the current IS TESS standard and our candidate solutions. <br>  	Break into work groups to analyze some of the IS TESS issues. <br>  <br>  	Day 2:   <br>  	Continue work group effort. <br>  	Provide a summary of each group's findings. <br>  <br> III.	IS TESS Issues <br> The current IS TESS has TESS messages embedded within the structure.  As a result, any changes or new capabilities require modification to all affected communications systems.  Each communication system must be procured with a unique gateway that provides data per the Player Control Unit Common Training Instrumentation Architecture PCU CTIA (ie XML) standard.  Once again, changes to this standard may result in reprogramming of each effected gateway.  The IS TESS standard does include how TESS provides message addresses to a geographical area or a participant. <br>  <br> APM TRADE is considering a rewrite of the IS TESS standard where the communications system receives a TESS message and provides the same at the other end of the data path.  Issues to be resolved include the insertion of a radio's GPS and time stamp onto the message, implementing Quality of Service (QoS), and addressing of the message. <br>  <br> Tentative workgroups are <br> 1.	Addressing of Messages:  Between participants and gateway; participants and participants; and gateway/participant to a geographical area.  Effective method of providing a carbon copy of a message to the gateway. <br>  <br> 2.	Messages:  A system has three categories of messages -  between gateway and communications system; between TESS and communications system; between TESS and gateway.  Where should we standardize messages and where/how do we allow flexibility for different communication systems' capabilities? <br>  <br> 3.	IP Address Space:  Should the IS TESS standard adopt an IP Address space methodology? If so, does the address space include LTEC components such as detectors?  <br>  <br> IV.	Response to attend workshop. <br> When responding to attend the workshop, please provide the following information via email to sharon.may@us.army.mil by COB 14 February, 2013.   <br>  <br> In the event of technical questions, please send questions to james.grosse@us.army.mil  <br> and lewis.marmelstein@us.army.mil by COB 14 February, 2013. <br>  <br> 1.	Organization Name <br>  <br> 2.	Names and Titles of Attendees <br>  <br> 3.	Number of Attendees <br>  <br> 4.	Point of Contact (Name, Title, Address, Phone/Fax, Email) <br>

These efforts include the procurement and installation of the hardware and software components to provide continuous monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum and direction finding of basic electromagnetic radiation parameters in the frequency range of 20MHz to 3GHz.  The SMECS will consist of two fixed locations and one mobile system for detection and direction finding.  The two fixed systems will be located remotely on Tiefort and Granite Mountains and will be controlled from the SMECS monitoring station to be located in the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  The mobile portion of the SMECS hardware will be installed in the NTC G6 HMMWV (V-30B) communications shelter.  In addition, it is anticipated that delivery of initial spares, New Equipment Training (NET), and integration/testing support will be necessary. <br>  <br> Background Information: <br>  <br> Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS): <br> SMECS is a subsystem of the National Training Center - Instrumentation System (NTC-IS).  The SMECS is a stand-alone system.  SMECS provides the means to monitor, measure, and record all relevant NTC electromagnetic emissions that may interfere with the NTC or regional area surrounding Fort Irwin, CA.  It has the capability to track signal sources via fixed site and mobile direction finding.  The SMECS is comprised of two components, a Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) component and a Direction Finding (DF) component.   <br>  <br> Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) Component: <br> The RTMF component equipment is located at two fixed sites, Tiefort and Granite Mountains and controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  Data and control functions for the RTMF are provided via the Range Monitoring and Control Subsystem (RMCS) fiber-optic component.  The RTMF provides a real-time monitoring function to assess the battlefield spectrum during exercises and supports regional frequency management monitoring and control functions. The RTMF component of SMECS continuously monitors the electromagnetic spectrum over a frequency range from 20 MHz to 40 GHz.   <br>  <br> Direction Finding (DF) Component: <br> The DF component provides the capability to continuously monitor electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 20 MHz to 1 GHz, and upon operator selection, accurately display the line of bearing to the source of any signal of interest.  The DF component consists of three discrete components: a free ranging mobile DF, mounted on the NTC G6 HMMWV, and two functionally identical fixed sites located on Tiefort and Granite Mountains, which are remotely controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  These sites send and receive data and commands via the RMCS fiber-optic component. <br>  <br> Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The Government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in Feb 2013.  The Government does not plan to conduct an Industry day for this effort.   <br>  <br> RFI:  As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a no more than 5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/Government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.

Synopsis:

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC), National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ms Carol De Francesco, an expert in the treatment fidelity and coding in motivational interviewing.  NAICS 541712, with a Size Standard of 500 employees for reporting action purposes. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Work to be performed: As part of the RR&D grant titled, Auditory Rehabilitation from the Perspective of the Significant Other (No. C7067W), we require the professional services of an expert in coding motivational interviewing practices in healthcare using recognized scoring system on a contract basis. The goal of one of the phases of this research grant is to examine the effect of enhanced patient-centered counseling (PCC) and the influence of spousal involvement in pre-fitting counseling on patient hearing-aid satisfaction and outcome. This will be accomplished by assigning couples to one of four experimental groups. Two of the groups (the ones using PCC) will utilize components of motivational interviewing. All of the intervention sessions will be audiotape recorded, so that they can be coded to see how consistent/not consistent they are with motivational interviewing. Language and behaviors of the significant other also will be assessed using a recognized scoring system. This individual, (Ms. De Francesco) will have extensive experience with assessing treatment fidelity. This person also needs to have substantial experience with the proposed coding instruments (which she will be responsible for obtaining). Ms. De Francesco has trained with the developers of such coding instruments. During her review of session recordings, Ms. De Francesco may have exposure sensitive protected health information (PHI). If Ms. De Francesco were to have access to sensitive PHI, she would be required to complete VA Information Security and Privacy/HIPAA training first. Should requirement arise and training is complete, NCRAR will sponsor Ms. De Francesco for PIV badge and system access.

The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This justification is where in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received
will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

FAR Clauses 52.212-4 & 52.212-5 will be incorporated into the resultant contract award.

<a href="mailto:shannyn.scassero@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to issue a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract to a single source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, on or about 1 APR 2013 to Clinical Research Management (CRM). The period of performance is 5 years.  <br>  <br> USAMRAA intends to award this requirement as a sole source to CRM since the services are follow-on from a current contract award and awarding to another source would cause unacceptable delays/gaps in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract. This requirement is for direct support of US Army product development efforts to license Cryopreserved Platelets (CPP) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for management of severe hemorrhage from wounding.  The Government's ultimate goal is to establish a validated current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) process for CPP that meets regulatory requirements for FDA licensure and that can ultimately be transferred to military or other blood banks for manufacture of CPP for battlefield use.  The specific purpose of this proposed contract, is the continuation of development of CPP by CRM at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) that includes ongoing long-term storage/stability studies, characterization of CPP physical structure and function relevant to FDA requirements, evaluation of a new DMSO bag and closed fill system, conduct of process validation studies, support for submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA), and supply of clinical trial material.  As a sole-source logical follow-on to ongoing work by CRM at DHMC, this contracting action will enable the CPP Program to continue development without incurring significant schedule delays and duplicative costs as they relate to the establishment and qualification of a cGMP manufacturing facility. The CPP Program is scheduled to begin a Phase 1, low-dose escalation study in August 2013. CRM is the only known source capable of rendering the required services to deliver clinical trial material prior to the study start as no other contractor is currently developing a CPP product.   <br>   <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711 with the size standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by USAMRAA. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact Shannyn M. Scassero at shannyn.scassero@amedd.army.mil. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and following Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, 773rd Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Contracting Office intends to negotiate and award a sole source, firm fixed price (FFP) contract with Psytec, Inc., 520 Linden Pl, Dekalb, IL 60115, in accordance with Justification and Approval Authority: FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and 10 USC 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This sole source award is for seventy-five (75) Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) Questionnaire Packages (100 questionnaires per package). The CAPI Questionnaires are crucial to the detection of child abuse through screening potential victims with six factor scales and three validity scales for the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA)/Family Advocacy Program (FAP).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a product description or quotation which will be considered by the agency. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 323117, Books Printing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>F.O.B. Destination. The requested delivery date is two to four weeks after receipt of award.</p>
<p>The Ship To Address is: AFMOA/SGHW; Attn: Mr. Les Besetsny (210) 395-9269, leasley.besetsny@us.af.mil; 3515 S. General McMullen, Suite 1023, San Antonio, TX 78226</p>
<p>All questions pertaining to this solicitation must be in writing and emailed to SSgt Robert Widdoss at robert.widdoss@us.af.mil by 3:00 pm CST on February 11, 2013.</p>
<p>CLOSING DUE DATE: February 18, 2013; TIME: 3:00 P.M. Central Standard Time (CST). Offers must be submitted electronically to SSgt Robert Widdoss at robert.widdoss@us.af.mil and Mr. Joseph Preusser at joseph.preusser.1@us.af.mil by this date to be considered.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: AFMOA/SGHW is designing an evaluation project to determine the effectiveness of clinical interventions given to offenders involved in child maltreatment incidents. An inventory or questionnaire will be given to parents involved in child maltreatment referrals who receive services in the Family Advocacy Program. The instrument will be administered during the parents' first visit to FAP, and for those cases that meet criteria, the instrument will be administered after they receive services and the case is closed. The mean difference between the 2 administrations will be analyzed to determine if parents benefitted from interventions. The Conflict Tactics Scale, a popular assessment, was evaluated for use in our program evaluation effort but this instrument is used with adult incidents of maltreatment, not child incidents. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was also considered, but due to a number of open ended questions included in the instrument, data entry requirements were determined to be excessive. The Parenting Stress Index (PSI) was also considered but its' target is for parents with children 0-3 years of age. FAP provides services to parents with children up to 18 years of age.<br />AFMOA/SGHW selected the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) inventory because its' target population is for parents with children of all ages. It is in an agree/disagree response format with no open ended questions. It is also the most statistically reliable instrument in the field of child maltreatment for use in program evaluation. AFMOA/SGHW requires a vendor who can provide the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory in a scannable document format. The instrument must be able to be scanned to help improve data entry accuracy and to reduce the data entry workload.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The solicitation number is W911QY-13-R-0022 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-62, effective December 20, 2012.  This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.  <br>  <br> The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds.  Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12.  The Government anticipates awarding approximately three (3) contracts under this solicitation, but reserves the right to award, more or less than three awards, a single award, or no awards, if in the best interest of the Government. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds.   <br>  <br> The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: <br>  <br> This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation.  The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired:  <br>  <br> - Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to  1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.  <br> - Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application.  <br> - Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4.  <br> - Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process.  <br> - Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.  <br> - Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors.  <br> - Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products. <br>  <br> Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Draft Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 1) and decontaminate traditional and non-traditional chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA). The Offeror is to consider  quote mark one each quote mark  as all of the necessary components, packaged together as one item or kit, necessary to decontaminate sensitive or non-sensitive equipment as specified in the PSPEC.   <br>  <br> To access the full Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0022 and its attachments, click on the Solicitation Documents/Attachments link on this page.

<DESC>The Government requires a high throughput screening reactor system to assess the response of various materials to exposure to high pressure hydrogen at temperatures up to 500 C and pressures up to 100 bar.  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The system shall meet the following requirements: 1.	Hydrogen Compatibility a.	The materials of construction shall be compatible with hydrogen for all parts that come into contact with high pressure hydrogen. b.	Because of the small volumes of hydrogen being used, no special electrical systems are required, but all parts shall be properly grounded to minimize the potential for sparks. 2.	Pressure Vessel a.	Four (4) independent pressure vessels shall be provided.  The system shall be capable of being expanded to operating at least eight (8) pressure vessels simultaneously. b.	The total volume of the pressure vessels shall be 100 ml or less with a total volume of 50 ml or less preferred to minimize thermal mass.  The pressure vessel volume shall be minimized within the constraint that the temperature sensor and any other system parts in the vessel interior shall fit into the vessel without touching the sides and sufficient free volume shall remain for a sample of powder, foil or other solid material occupying 5 ml to 10 ml to be placed in the bottom of the vessel. c.	The pressure vessel and all other pressurized parts shall be capable of safely operating at a pressure of 100 bar (1450 psi) at 500 C.  Applicable ASME pressure vessel standards and codes shall be used to design and manufacture the parts. d.	The pressure vessel used for exposing the samples shall be capable of continuous operation at temperatures up to 500 C.  The vessel shall be designed and built using applicable ASME pressure vessel standards and codes. e.	Documentation shall be provided to demonstrate that the pressure vessels meet applicable ASME standards and codes.  The documentation shall cite the applicable codes and provide relevant calculations to demonstrate that the vessels can be safely operated at the desired maximum pressure and temperature. f.	A pressure relief system shall be provided to prevent over-pressurization of the system.  The exhaust port of the pressure relief system shall be connectable to stainless steel tubing/pipe through a threaded or other fitting to allow it to be vented to an exhaust. g.	The pressure vessel shall have a closure system designed for easy opening and closing within the constraint that it shall contain a high pressure. h.	The pressure vessel shall have a seal suitable for operation at the maximum sustained operating pressure and temperature.  Strong preference shall be given to systems that use a metal seal, and preference shall be given to a system that uses a graphite or similar seal over a polymer O-ring seal or similar. 3.	Gas Supply System a.	The Government shall provide hydrogen gas from a standard K bottle.  The grade of the hydrogen shall be Ultra High Purity (UHP, 99.999%) or better.  The cylinder size shall be 300.  The maximum cylinder pressure shall be 2400 psig.  The Offeror shall be responsible for providing a connection for the gas cylinder to the system and pressure regulation. b.	The system shall use a manifold or other means to deliver hydrogen gas to the vessels individually.  At a minimum, pressure shall be independently controlled for each vessel.  Following pressurization, the system shall either allow sealing of the pressure vessel to maintain pressure or automatically maintain pressure within each vessel independent of the other vessel pressures.  A gas mass flow measurement and/or control system shall be given preference but is not required. c.	The pressure vessels shall have a vent that can be routed to an exhaust using stainless steel tubing for safe disposal of the gas after testing. 4.	Heater a.	The system shall use a heater that is external to the pressure vessel. b.	An over-temperature control system shall be included in the system.  The over-temperature control system may either be part of the temperature control system or a separate system, but preference shall be given to a totally independent system first and a system with a separate temperature measurement sensor second. 5.	Controller a.	A controller for the system shall be provided that shall control the temperature of the vessels individually.  Strong preference shall be given to a controller that shall control the pressure in the vessels individually throughout the entire test.  Preference shall be given to a controller that can introduce a controlled pressure into the pressure vessel before a test and seal the vessel through a valve over a system with strictly manual control.  Preference shall be given to a system with a controller that can monitor and control an optional stirrer (See Option 3).  A graphical interface is preferred but is not required for the controller. b.	The controller shall be capable of running at least a three segment program. i.	Ramp to a preset temperature (and pressure, if controlled by the controller) set point. ii.	Hold at the operating setpoint for a specified length of time. iii.	Decrease the temperature to room temperature (and atmospheric pressure, if applicable) and end test. 6.	Data Acquisition a.	An output shall be provided from the temperature control system to allow recording of the power output as power (watts), a percentage of total power, or similar measure of absolute or relative output.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that a mildly exothermic reaction is not masked by a reduction in heater output. Alternative systems to ensure this goal shall be considered as well. b.	 A high precision temperature measurement probe shall be provided to measure the in situ temperature of the sample.  The probe shall be a resistance temperature device (RTD), thermistor or similar device.  Systems that use a Type E or J thermocouple shall be considered, but strong preference shall be given to other temperature measurement methods that provide higher temperature measurement precision.	Strong preference shall be given to four wire RTD and similar sensors that are resistant to self-heating, electronic noise, lead length effects and other common problems that degrade a sensor signal. c.	The interior gas pressure of the vessels shall be measured using a pressure transducer or other method that can be recorded electronically.  Strong preference shall be given to systems that measure the pressure of each vessel of a multiple vessel system independently rather than measuring a single manifold pressure. d.	The DAQ system shall provide, at an absolute minimum, monitoring, recording and real time display of the pressure and in situ temperature of each pressure vessel. Strong preference shall be given to a DAQ system that also records the power output of the heater through monitoring the temperature controller.  Preference shall be given to systems that can also provide recording of other process parameters such as the heater temperature and optional stirrer (See Option 3) speed. e.	The DAQ system and controller may be integrated into one system or independent systems.  There is no preference. f.	To transfer the data to a computer for analysis, the DAQ system shall provide one of the following options. i.	 The DAQ system shall be able to transfer the data to a USB memory stick (preferred), CD/DVD or other media in a file format compatible with Microsoft Excel 2010, e.g., Excel worksheet, plain text, and comma separated variable. ii.	The DAQ system shall connect directly to a computer such as an HP ENVY 20-d010t TouchSmart All-in-One Desktop PC through a USB, Ethernet or other standard wired communication connection.  Wireless LAN is also acceptable but not preferred due to possible RF interference.  In this case, the DAQ system shall be compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 8 64-bit operating systems. iii.	The DAQ system shall be software running on an HP ENVY 20-d010t TouchSmart All-in-One Desktop PC or similar computer compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 8 64-bit operating systems that connects to the controller or other electronic system to collect data through a USB, Ethernet or other standard wired communication connection. 7.	General Requirements a.	The DAQ system shall operate on 120 V AC power with current not to exceed 15 A. The heater and other systems requiring electrical power may operate on 120 VAC single-phase, 208 V single-phase, or 208 V three-phase power. b.	A stand shall be provided to hold the pressure vessel, heater and associated hardware, cables, supply lines, etc.  The stand shall also accommodate an optional stirrer (See Option 3) if purchased.  A fixed head design that does not require the removal of the top of the pressure vessel from the stand and allows the various supply and electrical lines to remain fixed in place when changing samples shall be given preference. c.	The Offeror shall provide a listing of materials of construction of the pressure vessels and material certifications d.	The results of any applicable pressure testing done on the vessel and pressure feed system shall be provided.	At a minimum, the results of a suitable pressure test to demonstrate the pressure vessels can operate at 1450 psi or higher shall be provided. This test may be done at room temperature and accepted engineering practices be used to demonstrate that the pressure vessel is safe to operate at the maximum temperature and pressure. e.	The system may use cooling water, shop air and other common utilities.	Such needs shall be clearly listed in the quote. f.	All power cables shall be provided with the system.  All physical connections to water, hydrogen, etc., shall use appropriate industry standard connections, e.g., National Pipe Thread (NPT) fittings for water. g.	An operating manual shall be provided for the system.  The manual may be a hard copy or on CD/DVD in Adobe Acrobat format.  The manual may also consist of a set of manuals for each component.  Drawings, electrical schematics and flow diagrams for the system shall be provided if they exist to aid in the installation of the system. h.	A minimum of 30 days of technical support after receipt of the system by the Government shall be provided to aid installation and initial operation. Options: The Government also seeks pricing for the following options.  No Bid shall be considered acceptable with the exception of Option 1.  Pricing for the three options shall be applicable for up to nine (9) months after receipt of order. Option 1  Additional Pressure Vessels As stated in the specifications, the system shall be capable of operating up to at least eight (8) vessels simultaneously.  An option to add four (4) more vessels and increase the total number of vessels to eight (8) shall be provided.  All of the requirements for the initial four (4) vessels are applicable to this option.  The controller and DAQ system from the base purchase may be used for these vessels, but any required cables, controller upgrades, hydrogen supply, etc. shall be included in the cost of this option. Option 2  Vacuum System Vacuum bakeout to remove air, water, hydrocarbons and other volatile species is desired. The system shall allow heating of the pressure vessel to 500 C under vacuum.  The vacuum system shall be capable of producing a vessel pressure in the 10-6 torr range.	The vacuum system shall be sized to evacuate up to eight (8) vessels simultaneously and obtain the 10-6 torr range within one (1) hour when the pressure vessels are empty and at room temperature.  The system controller shall be modified both to provide a safety permissive to prevent simultaneous opening of the vacuum and hydrogen feed lines and to provide automatic operation of the vacuum and hydrogen subsystems to open and close the applicable valves. Option 3  Stirrer An option for a mechanical or magnetic stirring system shall be provided.  No preference shall be given to either type of stirrer.  The stirrer operating speed shall be between 100 and 500 rpm and may include a greater range of operating speeds.  The stirrer may be located above or below the pressure vessel but shall be compatible with the provided stand without significant modification of the stand or stirrer.  The stirrer shall include any required mounting hardware to attach it to the stand.  The stirrer shall operate using 120 V AC power. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system. <br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- <br> (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;  <br> (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br> (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br> (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br> (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br> (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br> (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br> (ii) Examples. <br> (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. <br> (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. <br />"Registered in the CCR database" means that- <br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14) into the CCR database; and <br />(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. <br />(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. <br />(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. <br />(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. <br />(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- <br />(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or <br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: <br />(i) Company legal business. <br />(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. <br />(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. <br />(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). <br />(v) Company Telephone Number. <br />(vi) Date the company was started. <br />(vii) Number of employees at your location. <br />(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. <br />(ix) Line of business (industry). <br />(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). <br />(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. <br />(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. <br />(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR) is a federal program dedicated to providing neutral collaboration and conflict management services concerning environmental, natural resource, and public lands issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USIECR is a program of the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation, an independent, non-partisan agency of the federal government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional information about the Foundation and its programs may be found at <a href="http://www.udall.gov">www.udall.gov</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Required Services </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The contractor shall provide neutral third party collaboration and conflict resolution support services including process design, mediation, facilitation, and documentation for the Dinkey Collaborative group to assist them in seeking agreement on the restoration strategy for the Dinkey Landscape of the Sierra National Forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The project location is Clovis, California and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USIECR will issue task orders for services as needed. The timeframe for services may, but will not necessarily, run through April 30, 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award and continuation of a contract are subject to the availability of funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is expected that all task orders will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis; however, in exceptional circumstances, a time and materials order may be issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The minimum amount of services required to be ordered is $63,000.00. The maximum amount of services required is $400,000.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;A long history of costly litigation and project delays has plagued management plans for the Sierra National Forest and many national forests across California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the last decade, controversy surrounding the Sierra National Forest has focused on timber harvesting and the implications for the habitat of threatened and endangered species such as the Pacific Fisher and old-growth forest stands. While timber sales on the Sierra National Forest have remained stalled over the years as groups contested Forest Service decisions, the local timber mill that supported the local economy has been struggling to remain in business. In 2009, after 2 years of intense negotiations with a third-party neutral mediator, a collaborative group came to agreement on how to proceed with a 5,000 acre timber thinning project called the Kings River Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2010, the Sierra National Forest received funding through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program to support the Dinkey Landscape Restoration Project (DLRP). The purpose of this program is to provide funding to projects that are focused on collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes through timber thinning and fire management. The DLRP includes 130,000 acres, of which 20,000 acres are private land. USIECR has provided third party neutral conflict resolution services for this collaborative process for the past two years.</p>

<p>(1) [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;Are, [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) o&nbsp;Have, o&nbsp;have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;Are, [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ ]&nbsp; Have, [ ]&nbsp; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order&nbsp;13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph&nbsp;(i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

The prior, express written permission of the Contracting Officer is required to assert copyright in all other data first produced in the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii) When authorized to assert copyright to the data, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notices of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, and an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number).</p>

<p>(2) Data not first produced in the performance of this contract.

<p>(i) Identifies the data; and</p>
<p>(ii) Grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or, if such data are restricted computer software, the Government shall acquire a copyright license as set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this clause (if included in this contract) or as otherwise provided in a collateral agreement incorporated in or made part of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government will not remove any authorized copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph (c), and will include such notices on all reproductions of the data.</p>

<p>(2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or</p>
<p>(3) If the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Unauthorized marking of data.</p>
<p>(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (g) (4) if included in this clause, and use of the notices is not authorized by this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting Officer may at any time either return the data to the Contractor, or cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.</p>
<p>(i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings;</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions.</p>
<p>(iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.</p>
<p>(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.</p>
<p>(3) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract.</p>
<p>(f) Omitted or incorrect markings.</p>
<p>(1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.</p>
<p>(2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor-</p>
<p>(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;</p>
<p>(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;</p>
<p>(iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and</p>
<p>(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.</p>
<p>(3) If data has been marked with an incorrect notice, the Contracting Officer may-</p>
<p>(i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or</p>
<p>(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.</p>
<p>(g) Protection of limited rights data and restricted computer software.</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor may withhold from delivery qualifying limited rights data or restricted computer software that are not data identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause. As a condition to this withholding, the Contractor shall-</p>
<p>(i) Identify the data being withheld; and</p>
<p>(ii) Furnish form, fit, and function data instead.</p>
<p>(2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the Government shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.</p>
<p>(3) [Reserved]</p>
<p>(h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Regional Nutrition Advisor is based within the Regional HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) at USAID/Southern Africa in Pretoria, South Africa.  The USAID Regional HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) strengthens the response to HIV/AIDS in ten southern Africa countries.  RHAP has a staff complement of 14 including the Office Director and 6 Technical Advisors.  The Technical Advisors, inclusive of this position, guide PEPFAR programming and travel frequently to all the countries in southern Africa, as and when requested by USAID Missions and PEPFAR teams.  RHAP's main function is to perform all activities related to the management of the PEPFAR programs in the Non-Presence countries of Lesotho and Swaziland. This includes budgeting, procurement, and all accountability functions.  Furthermore, RHAP strengthens the technical and institutional capacity of African regional organizations to better implement HIV/AIDS programs and has a Knowledge Management program that is the custodian of best practices and cutting edge information on HIV/AIDS in the southern Africa region.
<p>The incumbent of this position will serve as a Regional Nutrition Advisor providing technical expertise and leadership to nutrition assessment, counseling, and support (NACS) programs affiliated with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding. The NACS model was developed to address the nutrition needs of populations infected and affected by HIV.  NACS provides a framework for strengthening nutrition support within all health programs at the facility and community levels and is an essential component of a comprehensive response to HIV care and treatment.  The incumbent of this position will work with PEPFAR country teams, national governments, implementing partners, NGO's, civil society groups and others to  address challenges, provide advocacy, and build needed technical capacity within countries to take NACS programs to scale.  In addition, the incumbent will foster critical linkages between the Global Health Initiative (GHI)/PEPFAR and Feed the Future (FtF) initiatives and investments working to strengthen coordination of USG and other donor investments in food security, nutrition, and health at the facility and community level.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS (IF &gt;$25K)</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION CLAUSES ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED</p>
<p>This contract incorporates the following clauses by reference with the same force and effect as if<br />they were given in full text. The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/opo_hsar_jun_2006.pdf<br /><br />CLAUSE NO and TITLE<br />HSAR 3052.209-70 Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006)</p>

<DESC>Executive Summary
 Virtual learning initiatives have become increasingly prevalent in the last few years, as the Veterans Administration (VA) has looked for innovative ways to utilize the benefits of technology and increase the effectiveness of education.  Web-based classrooms offer a paradigm shift in the field of learning that provides high speed access to knowledge and information where training can occur anywhere resulting in substantial travel and time cost savings.  Simply put, virtual learning brings learning to people.
More importantly, it is critical that the VA supports a culture where application of new skills acquired from a training event is transferred to the worksite.  Linking learning to worksite performance requires a high degree of learner interactivity during the learning process.  Web-based classrooms offer an environment where interactivity among participants, facilitators and content experts is available.  Through this platform, training is enhanced through encouraging participants' active reflection on content and problem solving via facilitated discussion, action learning projects, coaching, mentoring, and continuous peer interactions.
Web-based classrooms which are virtual, interactive learning environments offer online training that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.  They are typically hosted websites designed to manage or administer various aspects of learning: delivery of learning materials, learner tracking, assessment and evaluation functions and support student and faculty communication and collaboration.  
Virtual Collaborative environments enhance and extend the current capabilities of existing Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) environments.  Enhancements include the ability to conduct distributed real-time learning, support small group learning activities in a virtual environment, and record and make available recordings classroom presentations for viewing at a later time.
The Midwest Mountain Veterans Engineering Resource Center (MWM VERC) has developed web-based classrooms for a number of VA programs and hosted them in a Blackboard Learn environment.  The VLE system is hosted on Blackboard servers using the Blackboard Learn and Collaborate software.  The MWM VERC currently has a 1000 user license.  Several of our classes are based on a methodology called "Flipping the Classroom" where our presentations are split into 1 to 10 minute videos which the students review prior to signing into a virtual collaborative learning session.  The students use the collaborative session to interactively work on exercises.  The VERC uses Microsoft Powerpoint and Adobe Captivate on PC's and other Apps on IPads to develop the videos.
Although our current VLE is Blackboard based the MWM VERC is interested in determining what additional capabilities and approaches may be available for Web-Based learning environments.  Technology is advancing at a furious rate and the VA/VERC would like to leverage all new technology available for a Web Based learning environment.  However, the VERC will continue to develop and deploy training media using "Flip the Classroom" methodologies.  The goal of the VERC is to provide a 100% virtual training environment that allows real time interaction between the student and instructor.  This environment should have the look and feel of a face-to-face classroom setting.
Core Requirements
The VERC currently has a set of core capabilities and would like to determine what VLE systems meet these capabilities and perhaps provide new technologies and methodologies.  The core capabilities of our current system are;
Security Requirements
1.	Access control that is UserID / password based,
2.	Hosting environment needs to be a web base encrypted site (HTTPS),
3.	User access must be role based (Instructor, Student, Teaching Assistant, Administrator, Guest, etc.),

Hosting Requirements
4.	Capacity to accommodate up to 1,000 users at any point in time,
5.	Managed Hosting Services - Infrastructure, deployment, and day-to-day maintenance of the physical hardware and other supporting IT components,
6.	Include all costs related to hardware, licenses and software necessary for an enterprise solution, 
7.	24 x 7 user availability except for scheduled maintenance downtime.
8.	Provider maintains responsibility for: 
8.1.	supporting application administrators
8.2.	managing application and infrastructure security
8.3.	redundant data backup
8.4.	system application upgrades and maintenance
8.5.	application tuning
8.6.	all other aspects of a complete enterprise management solution

<p>(c) Scope-Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest. This clause is intended to ensure that the Contractor (1) does not obtain or appear to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of actual or potential unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary or procurement-related information, (2) does not obtain or appear to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of any relationship (social, familial, financial etc) between the Contractor or Contractor's employees and any Government employee, Government contractor or Government contractor employee involved in the procurement process or the administration of the contract whether or not specifically identified in this solicitation, (3) is not biased or potentially biased or its ability to render impartial advice to the Government impaired or potentially impaired due to Contractor's current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational or otherwise) that relate to the services performed or products to be delivered under this solicitation, or (4) any other potential conflict of interest identified or within the scope of FAR 9.5.

If, before or after award, an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified by the Government or discovered by the Contractor, the Contractor shall immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. The Contractor further recognizes that during the term of this contract, conditions may change which may give rise to a newly recognized actual or potential conflict of interest.

<p>(1) a description of the actual or potential conflict of interest and identify the parties involved;<br />(2) a description of the work affected by the actual or potential conflict of interest; and <br />(3) a mitigation plan as described in section (f).</p>

If accepted by the Contracting Officer, the mitigation plan will become part of the contract.</p>
<p>(g) Final Authority. The Contracting Officer is the final authority in determining whether a conflict of interest exists and whether the conflict of interest has been adequately mitigated, neutralized or avoided.</p>
<p>(h) Remedies.

If the conflict of interest results from conflicting financial or other interests involving Contractor personnel performing under this agreement, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to remove such personnel from performance of work under the contract as a means to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the conflict of interest. If the Contractor was or, with reasonable diligence, should have been aware of a potential conflict of interest before award, or discovers or with reasonable diligence should have discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and does not disclose or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, it will be deemed a material breach of the agreement/solicitation.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>Section M - Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>M.1 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and issue a single contract without discussions. Therefore the<br />Offeror's proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government<br />reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. If the Government decides that negotiations are necessary, it will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.</p>
<p>The Government may also summarily reject any offer not substantially in compliance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>M.2 Factors - Order of Importance. The evaluation factors are Acceptability, Mission Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Acceptability will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Mission Capability is more important than Past Performance. The technical factors (Mission Capability and Past Performance) individually and when combined are significantly more important than Price. Price will become increasingly more important as non-price evaluation factors become increasingly equal.</p>
<p>M.3 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Acceptability</p>
<p>a. Acceptability Criteria: The proposal will be reviewed to ensure that it conforms to all terms and conditions listed in the solicitation, the signed SF 1449, and has the requisite Top Secret facility clearance demonstrated by the Top Secret printout. If the offeror takes exception to any of the terms and conditions or fails to provide the signed 1449 or the Top Secret printout, the offer may be rejected and be considered no longer eligible for award.</p>
<p>b. Acceptability Ratings:</p>
<p>i. Pass: The proposal conforms to the terms and conditions listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>ii. Fail: The proposal does NOT conform to the terms and conditions listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Technical</p>
<p>c. Technical Criteria: The evaluation will consist of assessing the depth and appropriateness of the experience of the Offeror's proposed key personnel for the intended position. The evaluation will also assess the ability of the proposed offeror to meet the security clearance requirements for the intended positions.</p>
<p>d. Technical Capability (Resume) Adjectival Ratings:</p>
<p>i. Outstanding: The proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.</p>
<p>ii. Good: The proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>iii. Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>iv. Marginal Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.</p>
<p>v. Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. Past Performance Criteria: The evaluation will consist of assessing the relevancy of the Project Summaries to the scope, magnitude, and the types of tasks set out in the PWS. When evaluating past performance the government will consider:</p>
<p>i. Experience performing technical tasks in the PWS. <br />ii. Dollar value (i.e. magnitude) of the contractor's related experience<br />iii. DoD experience and other experience-related benefits that may affect the execution of the requirement. <br />iv. The degree to which the contractor has satisfied its customers.</p>
<p>b. Past performance within the DoD and OUSD(I) is considered more relevant than performance with other government agencies. The government may also consider information obtained from any other sources when evaluating past performance. Failure of a contractor to disclose a relevant Government contract with poor past performance may affect the contractor's past performance rating.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance Adjectival Ratings: Past Performance will be given two ratings. The first rating will be a relevancy rating, based on the following:</p>
<p>i. Very Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>ii. Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>iii. Somewhat Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>iv. Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The second rating will be a Performance Confidence Assessment, based on the following:</p>
<p>i. Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>ii. Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>iii. Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>iv. Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>v. No Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>d. The Government reserves the right to determine which past performance examples submitted by the Offeror are relevant to the requirements.</p>
<p>e. In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (neutral evaluation).</p>
<p>3. Price</p>
<p>a. The evaluated price is the sum of the pricing for the base period, all option years, and the six-month extension authorized by 52.217-8. Extension pricing will be calculated as one half of the last option year. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and completeness. Price reasonableness evaluation may use one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1.</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>M.4 Evaluation Definitions</p>
<p>a. Strength: An aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance.</p>
<p>b. Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.</p>
<p>c. Significant Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that significantly increases the risk of unsuccessful <br />contract performance.</p>
<p>c. Deficiency: A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.</p>
<p><br />M.5 Offerors are cautioned against submitting an unbalanced offer. The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to price. An example of an unbalanced offer would be proposed labor rates that are significantly less than or significantly overstated in relation to the proposed rates for other labor categories (either of the offeror's proposal or the same labor categories as proposed by other offerors). The Government may also consider an offer unbalanced if there is a significant difference between proposed labor rates in the same labor category between option periods or the proposed costs/prices from year to year are above what would be considered a reasonable adjustment for inflation. Offers that are determined unbalanced may be rejected.</p>
<p>M.6 Protests (Agency-Level)</p>
<p>Potential bidders or offerors may submit a protest directly to the Contracting Officer. As an alternative to the Contracting Officer's consideration of the protest, a potential bidder or offeror may request an independent review of their protest by a WHS Protest Deciding Official. A request for an independent review shall be submitted to:</p>
<p>Angela Kornegay, Division Director<br />WHS/AD Enterprise Analysis &amp; Studies Division<br />2421 S. Clark Street, Suite 3000<br />Arlington, VA 22202-3909</p>
<p>A protest decision by the Contracting Officer or WHS Protest Deciding Official is final and not subject to appeal or reconsideration within WHS.</p>

<DESC><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announces the opening of the first Multi-State Plan Program (MSPP) application period by releasing our final application for health insurance issuers who wish to apply for participation as an MSPP Issuer in Affordable Insurance Exchanges for 2014. </span>
<p>Issuers must apply through OPM's web-based MSPP Application Portal (Portal), which we expect to be available to receive applications beginning in February.  We are publishing this paper application now so that issuers can review and familiarize themselves with the application questions, assemble their response team and begin to prepare responses.</p>
<p>An issuer interested in participating in the MSPP may begin the application process by submitting a Notice of Intent to Apply (NOI) with the following information via email to MSPP@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Subject Line:  Notice of Intent to Apply</p>
<p>Contact Name<br />Title<br />Phone Number<br />Email address</p>
<p>Issuer Legal Name<br />Issuer Marketing Name (if different)<br />Street Address<br />City, State, ZIP<br />National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Code</p>
<p>Once OPM confirms the entity submitting the NOI represents a health insurance issuer or group of issuers with potential nationwide scope, we will contact you with instructions on how and when to access the Portal.</p>
<p>Submitting a NOI is not binding and does not commit an issuer to become an MSPP Issuer.  However, an issuer cannot submit an application without first submitting a NOI.</p>
<p>An Applicant User Guide will be available at the time the Portal opens.</p>
<p>There are a number of templates that will accompany an application.  Three of these templates are OPM-specific.  Two are included here; the third will be posted as soon as it is final.  The attached templates are:</p>
<p>&bull;	MSPP Financial Ratings Template<br />&bull;	MSPP Enrollment History Template</p>
<p>The template not yet available is the MSPP Participating Provider Template.</p>
<p>For the remaining templates, OPM intends to use those created by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for qualified health plans for MSPP applicants to submit information, including rates and benefits.  These templates will be used by the Federally-facilitated Exchanges as well as by the NAIC's System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing in support of State-based Exchanges.  Since those remain in draft, we do not include them here.  The draft templates are available at: http://www.serff.com/draft_plan_management_data_templates.htm</p>
<p>If you have questions, please write us at MSPP@opm.gov .</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; This final application represents policies included in proposed regulations for the MSPP.  Accordingly, OPM reserves the right to modify this application, as necessary, and to request additional information from applicants.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006. <br /><br />The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.<br /><br />When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank." <br /><br />In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s). <br /><br />If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.<br /><br />The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.<br /><br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system. <br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.<br /><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications.

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.271-79 Liability and Insurance (Apr 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor s control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantial all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.</p>
<p>(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.</p>
<p>(e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer. The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance.

All such personnel shall comply with contractor rules and regulations governing personnel at its shipyard, including those regarding safety and security.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor further agrees to allow a reasonable number of officers, employees, and designated personnel of offerors on other contemplated work, the same privileges of admission to the contractor's facility and access to the vessel(s) on a noninterference basis, subject to contractor rules and regulations governing personnel in its shipyard, including those regarding safety and security.</p>

<p>(b) No amount for lay day time shall be paid until all contract line items (including optional items) that require drydocking of the vessel have been completed. Lay days for work ordered pursuant to the Additional Item Requirements Clause shall not be compensable unless all dry dock work included in the contract line items is complete. <br /><br />(c) Days of hauling out and floating, whatever the hour, shall not be paid as lay day time, and days when no work is performed by the contractor shall not be paid as lay day time. Days in which work is performed that are considered normal "non-work" days (weekends or holidays) shall not be paid as lay day time if the ship would have otherwise been in dry dock.</p>
<p>(d) Payment of lay day time shall constitute complete compensation for all costs associated with lay days except for costs directly related to the changed work.</p>
<p>1352.271-87 Changes - Ship Repair (Apr 2010)<br />(a) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract, in any one or more of the following:<br />(1) Drawings, designs, or specifications, when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications;<br />(2) Method of shipment or packing;<br />(3) Place of performance of the work;<br />(4) Time of commencement or completion of the work; and<br />(5) Other requirements within the general scope of the contract.</p>

However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(e) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><p>The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items for Solicitation Number: SOL-CI-12-00049 which was posted on October 29, 2012 is amended to reflect a change to the Performance Work Statement as well as to respond to vendor questions.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp; Relative to the Performance Work Statement, any and all references to ""aerostat system" shall be changed to "aerial system". The change will be reflected in the award document when award is made.&nbsp; Please also see change to Title" of this combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> The following questions were received in response to the combined synopsis/solicitation. Answers are provided below each question.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span>. In order to properly account for density altitude effects and to offer the appropriately sized lighter-than-air system, can the EPA provide the highest means sea level elevation the system will be operated from?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> 5,500 feet<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span>. Under Minimum General Specifications there is a requirement "of lofting an approximately 23 kg payload to heights up to 300m". What is the maximum ground elevation and temperature?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> ~5,500 feet, ~100 dgrees F<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span>. Having read the minimum general specifications, the Contractor is concerned that the EPA is potentially requesting an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system based on the following descriptions, "aerial system must be maneuverable at a user-controlled altitude and coordinates either via electronic or non-carbon fuel self-propulsion" and on the phrasing of &lsquo;or' a "ground-based tether on a mobile platform." For untethered systems, has the EPA considered the restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the operation of UAVs in domestic airspace?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span>. The requirements state that the system must be capable of being transported in a 20' trailer. Must the Contractor assume that for systems comprised of a lighter-than-air envelope, that the system is inflated or deflated?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Deflated.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span>. Does the trailer transport requirement referred to in question #3 include pressurized gasses and storage, winch, and ground control station components? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> All but the gases.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6</span>. The structural requirements require a "quick change payload amount, allowing change out in less than two minutes." Can the EPA provide drawings and additional detail about the payload to allow the contractor to design a mount?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> A similar payload is described in detail in Aurell, et al., Chemosphere. 2011 Oct, 85(5):806-811. This payload was attached with three main lines and 6-8 others, all taut, to Quicklinks on an aluminum frame.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7</span>. Will the EPA supply its own ground control station for the payload system?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 8</span>. The requirements mention operation of system components off of a trailer or an ATV using a winch weighing no more than 150 lbs. This requirement creates concerns that the winch weight alone would be insufficient to anchor the system safely. Is the Contractor expected to provide a means to secure the winch system to a specific vehicle? If so, what are the requirements for attachment? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The Contractor is not expected to provide the means of securing the winch to the mobile platform other than providing a reasonable base with which to do so. The winch weight is a desired amount.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 9</span>. The Contractor is concerned that the lift generated by sudden wind gusts or rapid changes in local weather could generate sufficient lift or drag to present a significant operator hazard. What human safety factors has the EPA considered for aerostat operation tethered to an ATV, Gator, or like system?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The EPA's mobile system (ATV, etc.) must, of course, be of sufficient weight and durability to counter anticipated wind gusts.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 10</span>. Will the EPA consider a proposed aerostat system that can remain aloft for significantly longer than 2 hours and provide continuous payload power on more favorable or more preferential terms for exceeding specifications?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 11</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements it is not clear what is applicable to tethers aerostats versus RPVs. Does a weathervaning tethered aerostat meet all of the manoeuverability, controllability, and positioning requirements?&nbsp; <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Potentially, yes, although the EPA is not familiar with the performance of such devices. The vendor should provide sufficient documentation to enable EPA to determine that the minimum specifications are met by the proposed device.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 12</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements one bullet has a requirement for the winch to be "capable of 0 to 50 m/min, while another bullet states "can be retrieved from 150 m altitude within 2 min" or 75 m/min. What is the maximum winch speed required and what is the assumed maximum wind speed for this performance?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> 50 m/min</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 13</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements there is a requirement for a "Battery operated (use of 12 V) electric winch...". Is it acceptable to use a supplemental generator to meet the speed requirements listed above?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 14.</span> Under Minimum Operational Requirements there is a requirement for "flight-tolerant of turbulence such as that expected from open fire thermals such as forest fires." Will this level of turbulence be defined, and will an analysis be required to validate the system operates in the defined conditions?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> An analysis will not be required. Past operations have encountered an extreme case of a 7G force.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 15</span>. Will a tethered aerostat be subject to the FAA FAR 101 requirements for tether markings? If so will the weight of the flags and/or strobes be counted as part of the payload weight?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> This will be site-dependent. The markings will be counted against the payload capacity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 16</span>. Will the system be expected to operate in day and night conditions?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Day only.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 17</span>. For a tethered aerostat systems, is there a requirement for the aerostat to be flying while the gator is driving? If so, what is the maximum required speed and the maximum distance it will travel?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, approximately 5 mph, but only for distances of 500 feet or less, the exception being the situation in which the system was being transported for short (~2 miles) distances to a different site location but with the payload optional.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> All of other terms and conditions posted in the original combined synopsis/solicitation remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC><p>Another set of questions was received and EPA has made the decision to respond to them. Any future questions may be answered at the discretion of EPA.</p>
<p><br />The following requirements imply that the air vehicle must be an RPV with an on-board propulsion system:<br />&bull; Automated safe return or rapid landing feature if ground control or wireless connection fails.<br /><em>Comment</em>: Tethered aerostats have no such capability; they do have a rapid deflation device which automatically actuates upon a tether break (per FAA requirement).<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If the Offeror proposes a remotely piloted vehicle, it must include a return to home feature.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Capable of maintaining a fixed position (+/- 10m) wrt to the ground and altitude.<br /><em>Comment</em>: With no active airborne controls, tethered aerostats are subject to winds aloft; in a steady wind, it provides a very stable platform but with wind direction or intensity changes its fixed position may vary more than +/- 10m.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Of course, this performance specification will be subject to wind conditions.<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Can maneuver or be maneuvered to move at 4m/sec (10 mph) in a quiescent atmosphere.<br />Comment: With no active airborne controls, the platform can be moved at 10 mph only by moving the ground mooring systems, i.e., the Gator.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response:</span> The specification for maneuverability must be accomplished independent of any ground mooring system.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Capable of being oriented in relation to the ground and maintaining that orientation.<br /><em>Comment</em>: See second comment above regarding maintaining a fixed position.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Of course, this performance specification will be subject to wind conditions.<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Capable of moving into the wind to a position lateral and perpendicular to its secure point<br /><em>Comment:</em> Tethered aerostats have this capability but only as driven by the prevailing wind. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If a tethered aerostat is proposed, then it must have a means of propulsion independent of any ground mooring system.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Minimal boundary layer or propulsion effect proximal to the payload that will affect gas collection from the payload sampler.<br /><em>Comment</em>: Tethered aerostats have no airborne propulsion systems.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If a tethered aerostat is proposed, then it must have a means of propulsion independent of any ground mooring system.</strong></p>
<p>Also, your responses to Questions 1 and 2 regarding the maximum operating altitude are a bit confusing. Specifically, in your response to Question 1, it is stated that the system will be operated from a maximum elevation of 5,500 ft ASL. The response to Question 2 states the maximum ground elevation is also 5,500 ft ASL with a required operating altitude of 300 m (~1,000 ft) AGL. Is it correct to assume that the density altitude of the airborne platform is 6,500 ft ASL, i.e., maximum elevation of 5,500 ft ASL + maximum operating altitude of 300 m AGL?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Yes, 6,500 feet.</strong></p>

<DESC>EPA has recently become aware of a commercial Federal Aviation Administration approved external camera pod system which would allow testing and operation of the EPA sensors in a standard Cessna 172 or Cessna 182 aircraft, without any modification of the aircraft. The original solicitation Scope of Work specified a high performance aircraft with camera port modifications to accommodate vertical image acquisition. This amendment extends the original solicitation to include unmodified Cessna 172 and Cessna 182 aircraft, in addition to the aircraft types previously specified. EPA would prefer the Cessna 182, due to its higher weight limits, higher operating speeds, and greater in-flight stability. As in the original solicitation, aircraft must be available for flight from RDU, or within approximately 30 miles of Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p>This solicitation is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 to provide for competitive selection of research proposals. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued. Contracts based upon the responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and are in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369 "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Awards issued under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013. No contract awards or other instruments that obligate funds will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY:</strong></p>
<p>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&amp;T will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission, the Chemical and Biological Defense Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. Within the CBD is the Threat Characterization and Attribution (TCA) Branch, which has the mission to conduct threat and risk assessments on both traditional and advanced agents; characterize biological threats, provide scientific support to the biodefense, chemical defense and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>The Biological Threat Characterization Program (BTCP) supports the TCA Branch within CBD of DHS S&amp;T. The BTCP has been established to characterize biological threats to support the four pillars of biodefense as outlined in HSPD-10: Threat Awareness, Prevention and Protection, Surveillance and Detection, and Response and Recovery. The Biological Threat characterization's goal is to improve the understanding of the impact of a biological attack on the country in order to enhance national preparedness.</p>
<p>Biological threat information requirements are identified and prioritized from internal DHS sources and other Federal government partners. This BAA seeks to conducts studies and laboratory experimentation to address information requirements in biological threat characterization. The measures of success are determined by the positive influence that the deliverables have on biological agent threat awareness, prevention of and protection from a biological agent incident, surveillance and detection during a biological incident, and response and recovery from a biological incident.</p>
<p><strong><em>DHS Biological Threat Characterization Program (BTCP) Mission</em></strong></p>
<p>The mission of BTCP is to characterize biological threats to support the four pillars of biodefense as outlined in the President's Biodefense Strategy for the 21st Century, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 10: threat awareness, prevention and protection, surveillance and detection, and response and recovery. The BTCP develops and provides knowledge reports and tools that address information requirements in biological threat characterization to better understand the risk uncertainty of current and future biological threats and to determine potential impacts to guide the prioritized development of countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines, and decontamination technologies.</p>
<p>There is a wide diversity of bacteria, fungi, viruses, toxins, and biomolecules known to cause human disease. Given the diversity and disease potential, a rational first approach is to rank order-known biological agents according to perceived risk and begin threat characterization by addressing the highest risk agents first. However, given the ever-expanding list of customized agents of potential concern, it is not feasible to develop medical countermeasures for every known pathogen and toxin. Instead, broader strategies are needed to address (i.e., characterize, assess, prioritize, and counter) multiple pathogens and toxins for less than the cost of a single bioagent scenario. Characteristics common to many potential Biological Threat event scenarios must be addressed as a class, mechanism, or parameter while maintaining the scientific and other factors that support evaluating biodefense options including likelihood, consequence or risk.<br /><br /><em>Priority Traditional Agents</em> - Traditional microbial agents occur naturally and can have a major impact on public health during natural outbreaks (e.g., E. coli 0157 in tomatoes) or if used nefariously to intentionally cause harm. Examples include Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and other microbial agents, and toxins such as those identified in the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent lists. The scientific community is making progress in understanding basic pathogen biology, environmental microbiology, host immunity, and model systems that contribute to an integrated systems-level assessment of traditional Biological Threats. The BTCP focus is risk-driving parameters of the agents, potential scenarios, and countermeasures. Defining parameters and mechanisms for a systems representation will enable better characterization of key contributions to risk. In addition, knowing these parameters allows the use of calibrated surrogates and simulants when direct evaluation with the agent cannot or should not be performed (e.g., safety, ethics, unculturable). The integrated traditional agent framework is the foundation and partial validation for assessments of risks from advanced threats. <br /><br /><em>Endemic, Re-emerging, and Newly Emerging Disease Assessment</em>--Outbreaks of naturally-occurring infectious diseases are here-and-now priorities that also provide data to calibrate the systems biology approach being developed using traditional agents. These pathogens and the diseases they cause will act as an important test platform for our integrated risk and evaluation systems and threat archetypes. This will both inform our systems development and maintain and expand our collaboration with and support to the public health community. <br /><br /><em>Advanced-threat Assessment</em>--The systems biology framework including threat archetypes developed for traditional agents, validated with data from endemic, re-emerging, and newly emerging diseases, extrapolated using parameters developed with surrogates and simulants when needed, and extended with the most up-to-date science and best predictions of technology trends, provides a robust assessment of potential advanced threat scenarios. The BTCP has made initial investments in these areas including evaluation of characteristics of traditional agents to improve assessments of advanced threats. In the future, this approach and knowledge-base facilitates proactive characterization and more rapid response.<br /><br /><strong><em>DHS Biological Threat Characteristic Program Objectives</em></strong></p>
<p>The objective of biological threat characterization is to improve understanding of the impact of a biological attack on the country to enhance national preparedness. This is accomplished by providing technical intelligence on identified knowledge gaps relating to biological agents and tools that address information requirements in biological threat characterization to better understand the risk uncertainty of current and future biological threats and to determine potential impacts to guide the prioritized development of countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines, and decontamination technologies.<br /><br /><strong><em>Description of Technical Focus Areas (TFAs)</em></strong></p>
<p>The focus of this BAA is in the area of Biological Threat characteristics, specifically:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-1</span>:</strong> Studies to understand Agent Production Rates and Storage Stability/decay rates. (At the current time BTCC is working on the High consequence Bio-threat agents and this BAA may be used for the solicitation of information in order to support information gathering for other agents to inform Risk Assessments).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-2</span></strong>: Studies to understand incubation time for disease onset after exposure using the best animal models. (Once again, the Government may use this BAA in order to solicit information of agents not currently focused by BTCC to better inform Risk Analysis).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-3</span>:</strong> Studies to understand morbidity and mortality rates using the best animal models or&nbsp;by gathering useful and credible human data to better inform Risk Analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-4</span>:</strong> Studies to better understand ID50 and LD50 for non high consequence pathogens using the best animal models or by gathering credible and useful human data to better inform Risk Analysis</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TFA-5</span>:</strong> Studies examining rational approaches to biological agent characterization given the ever-expanding list of agents of concern and shifting landscape in biotechnology.</p>

<DESC>The FAA seeks a supplier to develop and maintain a Retirement Benefits Calculator application.  The FAA requires a web-based interactive Retirement Benefits Calculator with both a Human Resources Specialist function and an Employee function that would allow the users to perform multiple retirement estimate calculations.

The Federal Aviation Administrations mission is to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world. The FAA strives to reach the next level of safety, efficiency, environmental responsibility and global leadership. It is accountable to the flying public and our stakeholders. Its success depends on the respect, diversity, collaboration, and commitment of our workforce. Safety is our passion and people are our strength.

These services will be available to approximately 48,000-50,000 FAA employees, dependents and those persons who have an equivalent relationship as a family member.  These services are provided in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories including St. Croix Island, St. Thomas Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, Guam and those employees working on a foreign assignment.

Of the approximate 48,000 FAA employees, almost 28,800 employees are air traffic controllers who, because of the terms of their employment, require specialized retirement benefits calculations and certification of specialized retirement coverage provisions per FAA 3300-30 (Creditable Service Computation).

<DESC>This synopsis was originally posted on/about 11 January, 2013 via FedBizOpps.gov. 
 
The synopsis is hereby amended to include the following changes and language:

1) The proposed action number is changed FROM N61331-13-R-1602 TO N61331-13-R-0017.
2) This requirement is being pursued under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This amendment is in accordance with Class Deviation 2013-O0004, dated 15 January, 2013.
3) The Government will make an award / award determination based on relevant technical factors and the determination of a fair and reasonable price.
4) All other terms, conditions, and languages (below) remain unchanged.

NSWC-PCD CDC2 intends to issue a three-year Indefinite Quantity (IQ) sole source contract to GE Intelligent Platforms Embedded Systems, 12060 S Memorial PKWY, Huntsville, AL, 36803-3308 to procure commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts or slightly modified COTS parts for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Navigation (C4N) Systems.
  The items being acquired are:

Nomenclature	Part Number(s)	FY13-FY15 Quantities
PMC 1553 Circuit Card Assembly, QPM-1553-1SG, Up to 80 each
PMC422 Circuit Card Assembly, PMC422, Up to 123 each

This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following reasons:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supplies may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
  The items being purchased were specifically tested and evaluated against the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) technical requirements as provided on the LCAC C4N System Baseline Configuration 3 (SBC3) product specification during the products initial prototyping and evaluation phase.  No other source for these interface boards currently exists.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334418 and the size standard is 500 employees.
  Any questions relating to this announcement are due 3 days from the date this notice is published, and no later than 1400 local time (CST).  POC is Miles Hooper, Code CDC2, telephone (850) 230-7692; fax (850) 234-4197; or e-mail address Miles.Hooper@navy.mil.

<DESC>The presentation slides from Multi-BAA Pre-Proposal Conference which was held on July 16, 2012 in Washington DC are included as an attachment to this solicitation.<br /><br />The mission of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop and procure medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, BARDA supports the advanced development and procurement of drugs, vaccines and other products that are considered priorities for national health security. BARDA funding bridges the "valley of death" characterizing the late stages of product development. BARDA's support ensures continuity of funding at a critical point for medical countermeasures developed by industry or emerging from the basic research and preclinical development activities sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In procuring medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile, BARDA enhances the capabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to organize an effective response.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives. The 2011 BARDA Strategic Plan defines BARDA's vision and lays out a series of capability goals over a five year period (2011-2016). Amongst BARDA's guiding principles is supporting the development of novel platform technologies that provide flexible systems for the production of medical countermeasures against a variety of threats. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to address, in part, BARDA's Goal 4, responsive and nimble programs and capabilities to address novel and emerging threats, as well as support the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense and pandemic influenza. The PAHPA and BARDA Strategic Plan are located on the ASPR website: http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/pages/default.aspx and http://www.phe.gov/about/barda/Pages/2011barda-stratplan.aspx.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a continuation of a previous BAA (BARDA-BAA-11-100-SOL-00001) and is similarly designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SST) of BARDA.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SST Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1.Pipeline acceleration and evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p>2.Product improvements to enhance safety, efficacy, ease of use, and manufacturability of MCM.</p>
<p>3.Product repurposing to treat novel and emerging pathogens.</p>
<p>4.In vitro diagnostic platforms for the rapid diagnosis of human infection.</p>
<p>The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases (EID). BARDA is open to evaluation of technologies at multiple stages of development, but advanced development activities of products specific for CBRN and Influenza will not be considered. Development activities are to be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts.</p>
<p>BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts and/or other transactions for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success, are of interest to the Government, and support one or more of the listed BARDA SST Areas of Interest.</p>

<DESC>Responses to this Survey are requested no later than 7 February 2013.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, will be issuing a solicitation in 2013 for removal of dredge material from transfer sites located in Upper Mississippi River Pool 4. Traditionally the Corps has awarded contracts for this type of activity via an invitation for bid (IFB) that provided detailed plans and specifications regarding the method, route and ultimate destination for the material to be removed. The Corps is currently considering alternate methods of accomplishing the removal of material from the transfer sites. One of the methods being considered is a sealed bid solicitation that specifies a performance requirement to remove and dispose of a given volume of material to a location (or for a use) identified and determined by the contractor. Upon removal of the dredged material, the contractor would take title to the material to be disposed of and is free to use or dispose of the material in any lawful manner. The traditional disposal sites provided by the Government <strong>would not</strong> be available for use by the contractor. This alternative solicitation method would leave it to the contractor to determine the most cost effective method of disposing of the material appropriately. The contractor would be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and approvals to dispose of the materials removed or put them into some other use.<br /><br />Regardless of the method of removal, the Corps is still required to evaluate the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of undertaking this work. It is anticipated that the Corps will prepare an environmental assessment which will consider, among other things, the reasonably foreseeable means by which the material will be transported from its present location to mainstream commerce (i.e. commercial port, rail or highway) or disposal facility. To assist our preparation of the appropriate environmental documentation, the Corps will be seeking information from interested parties regarding potential means of removal and transportation of the dredged material and general information regarding its ultimate use or disposal location.<br /><br />As part of this input process, the Corps will provide additional information regarding the characteristics of the material to be removed. That information will made available on an "as is" basis for the benefit of potential bidders and the Corps of Engineers does not warrant that all the material will be as described nor the suitability or marketability of the material to be removed for any particular purpose. We anticipate making that information available on or about January 7, 2013. The Corps will also issue a brief survey to gather some general information regarding interest in the material and general removal and transportation methods. The Corps is also interested in receiving additional information that the industry believes the Government should consider in structuring this solicitation.<br /><br />This notice does not constitute a solicitation. This announcement and the information gathering associated with it are for planning purposes only. The acquisition methods for this project and others of a similar nature have not yet been determined. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any interested party for costs incurred for providing a response to this request. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used by the Government to help determine the scope of its environmental review and will likely be incorporated, at least in generic form, into our environmental documents. Information provided may also be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Those responding to this survey are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge or provide feedback to any information submitted under this notice.

<DESC>This synopsis is for the repair order N00383-13-M-038D. This order covers the repair of 6 Modem, Communication (NSN: 7RH 5895 014576468 FX, P/N: 112010-1) and 1 Controller Receiver (NSN: 7RH 5895 014576475, P/N: 11993-1). L-3 Coomunications (CAGE: 60225) is the only approved source to repair.

The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
