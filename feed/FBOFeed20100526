<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division and the Pathology and Physiology Research Branch in collaboration with the Division of Respiratory Disease Studies hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to New York University for a study to provide data concerning the role of gene dose on chronic beryllium disease (CBD) in the transgenic mouse "knock-in" model that expresses the human HLA-DPB1 gene family. The project seeks to investigate the hypotheses: gene dose rather than exposure dose is the main determinant of severity of CD.
<p>Purpose:<br />This research seeks to provide data concerning the role of gene dose on chronic beryllium disease in the transgenic mouse "knock-in" model that expresses the human HLA-DPB1 gene family, namely:, HLA-DPB1*0401 and HLA-DPB1*1701 . The project investigates the hypothesis: gene dose rather than exposure dose is the main determinant of severity of chronic beryllium disease (CBD). This project seeks to investigate the contribution of homozygosity and heterozygosity for genes conferring increased susceptibility to CBD. The mice will be exposed to a single form of beryllium via pharyngeal aspiration. The outcome of the experiments will be measured by histopathological examination of the lung for a granulomatous response similar to that seen in CBD in humans (Frieman and Hardy, Human Pathology 1:25-44, 1970). These outcomes will be determined by PPRB scientists in HELD/NIOSH. <br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCHB-2010-84449, CDC NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or e-mail to RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or FAX to 304-285-6083. Phone 304-285-5880. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with New York University, 70 Washington Square S, New York, NY 10012-1019 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>CMS intends to award one or more contracts for Grouper Episode for Medicine. This is a full and open competition. Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract(s).
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Policy makers have expressed concerns that the current Medicare payment system includes incentives that encourage physicians to overuse some services and underuse others, pays physicians for care irrespective of their level of resource use, and offers higher revenues to physicians who furnish more services, regardless of whether they add value (MedPAC 2008). To remedy these concerns, the concept of value based purchasing (VBP) has been introduced into the policy arena. The goal of a VBP program is to provide information to providers to encourage more efficiency and to find ways to reward physicians financially for efficient use of resources and providing high quality care. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop a plan that will transition Medicare payments into a VBP program for physician and other professional services. Such a program will pay based on efficiency and the quality of services provided. The Act also requires DHHS to disseminate confidential feedback reports to physicians using episode groupers and/or per capita cost measures.</p>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) has the following provision in Sec 3003 IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PHYSICIAN FEEDBACK PROGRAM: The Secretary shall develop an episode grouper that combines separate but clinically related items and services into an episode of care for an individual, as appropriate. The episode grouper shall be developed by not later than January 1, 2012. The episode grouper is also integral to the technology required to fulfill Sec. 3007. VALUE-BASED PAYMENT MODIFIER UNDER THE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE. This section requires the Secretary to establish a payment modifier that provides for differential payments to a physician or a group of physicians for all services furnished under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). The differential payments would be made based on the quality of care furnished compared to cost.</p>
<p>CMS has been investigating techniques that can help identify higher cost practice patterns among physicians. One technique is to compare resource use at the episode of care level. Episodes of care represent a group of healthcare services (claims) for a health condition (e.g., hip fracture, diabetes) over a defined period of time for which a physician can be held responsible. Episode groupers are software programs that organize claims data into a set of clinically coherent episodes, usually linked by diagnoses. Episode grouping software requires users to specify the input parameters for a given set of outputs or data points produced by the software. The user determines the types of claims data that will be grouped, the time frames for which the data are collected, the various software profile settings, the physician attribution and benchmarking algorithms, and the information and resource metrics that will be provided to clinicians, among other decisions. Because of this flexibility and the substantial user discretion, no one correct episode grouping method exists.</p>
<p>In the two commercial grouping software products evaluated by Acumen, LLC under contract to CMS, episode types are characterized as chronic, acute, or preventive care. Chronic condition episodes typically are administratively defined for episode grouping purposes as having a 12-month duration, usually a calendar year. Acute episodes have no administratively-imposed time limits. Acute and preventive care episodes are generally much shorter in duration than chronic episodes, and are considered complete or "closed" when there is no activity within a given period. For example, if 90 days is set as the "clean period" for an episode related to hip fracture, and no claims listing a diagnosis of hip fracture are encountered 90 days after a claim in which hip fracture is diagnosed or treated, then the episode is deemed complete. Only certain claim types can initiate or open an episode. Physician Part B evaluation and management claims or surgery claims, an inpatient hospitalization, or a skilled nursing facility stay can start an episode. Ancillary claims and durable medical equipment claims cannot start an episode in either existing episode grouper, while home health claims and hospice claims may start an episode in one of the episode groupers studied. Since a person can be treated for more than one condition at the same time, episodes may be open simultaneously for different conditions.</p>
<p>The first CMS report on episode groupers by Acumen, LLC, entitled "Evaluating the Functionality of the Symmetry ETG and Medstat MEG Software in Forming Episodes of Care Using Medicare Data," concludes that 1) the grouping algorithms do not emulate physician practice patterns common in the Medicare system, 2) inpatient physician services often do not group with the associated hospital stays, and 3) there is considerable variation in costs within episodes and within episode types." This large variation in episode costs "...suggests the need to develop models of risk or severity adjustment applicable for Medicare populations prior to being able to use the episodes software for profiling Medicare providers".</p>
<p>A second CMS report by Acumen, entitled "Prototype Medicare Resource Utilization Report Based on Episode Groupers," discusses practical aspects of implementing resource utilization reports using episode groupers. The user shall determine how to apportion costs into episodes, risk adjust costs if necessary, assign physicians to those episodes, and define relevant peer groups for the purpose of comparing physicians' costs to each other. Empirical analysis is performed on the number of episodes required for valid comparisons among physicians). Determination and use of options is determined by the user.</p>
<p>On November 10, 2009, CMS hosted a public listening session on the design of a public domain episode grouper. This listening session solicited stakeholder comments on the range of issues in the analysis of the applicability of currently available tools to identify discrete episodes of care for Medicare beneficiaries. The url announcing the listening session is located at: http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-22959.pdf . The background information for the Session, including a white paper and PowerPoint slides can be found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/downloads/Listening_Session_Slides_2009-11-10_508_compliant.pdf . This procurement continues the process of developing a public use episode grouping software.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Approach A</p>
<p>The goal of Approach A is to modify an existing episode grouping software product for use in the Medicare program. The grouping processes and logic shall be readily understandable, transparent, and comprehensible to multiple stakeholders, including physicians, policy makers, and administrators. The logic shall be valid and reliable, and have a reasonable number of homogenous cost groupings (not thousands).</p>
<p>Conceptually, episode grouping is comprised of three sub-systems or modules: clinical logic, episode construction logic, and the risk adjustment method. Clinical logic refers to the basic framework for clustering, the rationale for grouping of condition codes, grouping algorithms, co-morbidities, hierarchy of grouping codes, acute exacerbations, signs and symptom diagnosis, disease interactions, and possibly severity levels (depending on the structure of the system). Episode construction logic establishes the processes and rules by which claims are grouped using the clinical logic.</p>
<p>Each of these subsystems can stand on its own, or be integrated with the other components into a software program that groups claims into episodes. Approach A is organized by these sub-systems. This procurement is only for episode grouping software and its components. Elements of a profiling system (attribution rules, benchmarking, standardized costs, etc.) may be considered in the design of data items that will be part of the grouper software's output design. Use of these elements will be determined by the vendor in collaboration with CMS.</p>
<p>Approach B</p>
<p>The goal of Approach B is to construct a new comprehensive public domain episode grouper. The grouping processes and logic shall be readily understandable, transparent, and comprehensible to the intended audience of physicians, policy makers, and health care administrators. It shall be valid and reliable, and have a reasonable number of homogenous episode groupings (not thousands). <br /><br />Conceptually, episode grouping is comprised of three sub-systems or modules: clinical logic, episode construction logic, and the risk adjustment method. Clinical logic refers to the basic framework for clustering, the rationale for grouping of condition codes, grouping algorithms, co-morbidities, hierarchy of grouping codes, acute exacerbations, signs and symptom diagnosis, interactions, and possibly severity levels (depending on the structure of the system). Episode construction logic establishes the processes and rules by which claims are grouped using the clinical logic.</p>
<p>Each of these subsystems can stand on its own, or be integrated with the other components into a software program that groups claims into episodes. Approach B is organized by these components. This procurement is for only episode grouping software and its components. Elements of a profiling system, e.g., attribution rules, benchmarking, standardized costs, etc., may be considered in the design of data items that will be part of the grouper software's output (with input from CMS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract(s). However, the Government reserves the right to negotiate different type of Contract(s).</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is estimated as follows:</p>
<p>APPROACH A</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the base period may be awarded to more than one contractor. The period of performance for the base period is 15 months; the period of performance for the Option, if exercised, is 24 months.</p>
<p>APPROACH B</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the base period will be awarded to more than one contractor. The period of performance for the base period will not exceed 15 months; and the period of performance for the option period, if exercised, will not exceed 48 months.</p>
<p><br />This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in late May or early June 2010 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fbo.gov.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Refrigerated Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. 1525

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with Dr. Deborah Ann (Bravo) Colosi, 6218 Wagner Lane, Bethesda, MD 20816, for professional service&nbsp;to support the NIMH's NeuroAIDS Therapeutic Initiative. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Therapeutic approaches have realized much success in managing HIV/AIDS, however strategies to prevent or treat the neurological complications that frequently accompany HIV disease have been less successful. This is due to limited availability of drugs across the blood brain barrier, the high degree of toxicity that accompanies long term use of current antiretroviral drugs, and the co-morbid mental health conditions that frequently accompany HIV/CNS disease, such as depression, anxieties, mood disorders, as well as others. While the extreme manifestations of AIDS dementia complex have decreased in frequency, less severe but nevertheless debilitating neurological complications persist. This is particularly important as individuals with HIV are living longer with compromised ability to function, also exacerbated by the normal aging processes in an increasing proportion of this population. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA) proposes to expand the therapeutics program by developing several initiatives to identify new therapeutic targets emerging from basic HIV neuropathogenesis research, and foster the pre-clinical and clinical testing of these drugs through mechanisms supportive of these approaches.
<p>The vendor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Develop several funding announcements which are part of an integrated strategy to expand on the development and testing of new therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of the neurological consequences of HIV/CNS disease. <br />2. Conduct the background research for these announcements, and consult with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) weekly to discuss current scientific approaches, ongoing clinical trials, and optimal strategies that should be incorporated into these announcements.<br />3. Assist Program in the development and management of the CHARTER contract extension. <br />4. Following the post review, assist Program in implementation and management of the next phase of this contract.<br />5. Provide technical and scientific assistance to the COTR in managing income of applications in response to these FOAs, assist in programmatic review of the science proposed in these applications, and assist program in management of the funding process for those selected.</p>
<p>Dr. Colosi has more than 5 years experience working in at Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. During that time, she participated in all aspects of the process of moving drugs from bench to bedside. This includes basic science research, planning and reviewing clinical trials, analyzing and summarizing results, and licensing issues. She has experience developing and reviewing bioassays for drug efficacy, as well as biotechnology, including proteomic technologies. In addition, Dr. Colosi has a strong background in basic science, including biochemistry and virology, as seen by her doctoral and post-doctoral research experience, which is essential to understand the complexities of targeting therapeutic interventions to HIV-mediated cell dysfunction. The CMHRA currently has a need for an expert with this expertise in the drug development process and yet the need for a strong programmatic approach to therapeutics in NeuroAIDS.<br /><br />Dr. Colosi has been researching the current state of therapeutic approaches to managing HIV/CNS disease over the past 6 months and has written an extensive review of this area. In addition, she has convened a meeting with some of the leaders in the field to review our current efforts and develop a set of recommendations for next steps. Given the extent of her knowledge, Dr. Colosi is considered uniquely positioned to move the NIMH's proposed approaches to the next phase. Not only does this initiative require knowledge of the field, but it also requires an understanding of existing programs at NIMH in order to leverage resources and maximize use of limited funds. Dr. Colosi has had past experiences with the workshops that she convened. Dr. Colosi's previous work for the NIMH has been outstanding and her continuation is critical to the development of this important program to improve the lives of individuals living with HIV. It is determined that Dr. Colosi is the only source qualified to perform the required services. No other sources will satisfy the agency's requirement.<br />&nbsp;<br />The period of performance is to be twelve (12) months from date of award. Place of performance is to be at the NIH main campus located in Bethesda, Maryland 20892. This acquisition is a fee-for-service type. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, interested party may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM E.T., June 4, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Please reference announcement number NOI-1589728 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with Microwave Instrumentation Technologies (MI Technologies), LLC, 125 Satellite Blvd., Suite 100 Suwanee, GA 30024-4629. This synopsis is for a follow-on effort to current contract N00421-05-C-0148. The contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The requirement will result in a new contract providing for a period of performance running from 30 October 2010 through 29 September 2015 for the continuance of maintenance services to support a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) that is currently maintained and operated by the Multi-Mission Data Link System Branch (4.5.10.5).

Description. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subparts 12.6 and 13.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole source purchase order for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Biological and Economic AnalysisDivision (BEAD) under the authority of FAR part 13.5 to Doane Marketing Research Inc. dba GfK Kynetec (GfK) for Agricultural Pesticide Usage Data.  
The EPA requires a 12-month subscription to the 2008 Doane AgroTrak Robust System, which includes the following:  a.) historical years database access (1998-2008); b.) ten web user licenses; and c.) all crops/all pesticide types database access.  The Period of Performance will be from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011.  
Before the EPA takes regulatory actions on pesticides, studies are conducted on human health, environmental, economic and social impacts as required by the FIFRA 92-515, as amended.  In order to adequately evaluate health, environmental, social and economic aspects of the use of substitutes for pesticides, a database is needed which contains accurate, current usage data for agricultural pesticides by chemical active ingredient, end-use product, pesticide type, and crop protected.  The type of usage data needed includes the following: total and base acres treated, total pounds applied, the number of farms treating, the time of application, the stage of the pest infestation, pesticide prices and expenditures, the rate of application, target pest and pest complex, the method of application, and other related factors, by state or designated region.
This purchase will make available to EPA pesticide market survey data and reports for 1998-2008, which will serve as a critical input in conducting economic and related analyses of pesticide regulatory matters.  These data are for internal use within the EPA, not for release to nonsubscribers or the general public without prior permission of the contractor.  The market studies should provide current data for herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and other pesticides used on various agricultural sites.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  It has been determined that GfK is the only source for this data that meets the Government?s requirements.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as stated herein, may submit its capability by 5:00 PM on Monday May 31, 2010, which may be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Abbie Jemmott at Jemmott.Abbie@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER: GS-23F-0020U<br><br>The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) executes the Homeowners Assistance Program (HAP) for the Department of Defense (DoD).  HAP execution normally requires the three field offices (Fort Worth, Savannah and Sacramento Districts) to obtain appraisals of applicant homes to establish their values before a DoD base closure announcement and the value at the time of their sale or purchase by the Government.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) expanded the HAP to provide assistance to the following groups of homeowners: wounded warriors, surviving spouses of fallen warriors, permanently relocating service members during the home mortgage crises, and service members and civilian employees impacted by the BRAC 05 announcement.  This expansion of HAP will require the processing of over 17,000 applicants over a three year period, a volume equal to that experienced during throughout the BRAC programs of the 90s.  <BR>The ARRA expansion of HAP demands rapid applicant processing and payment.  It also demands accurate valuation estimates of homes within applicants communities, community value trends over periods of up to four years, and present day values of applicant homes.  In order to meet ARRA goals and objectives, USACE field offices must process applications and pay benefits more quickly than ever before.  The DoD decided that one way to speed applicant processing is to avoid the requirement to use appraisals for home valuations.  Therefore, USACE will use an accurate automated valuation model (AVM) to establish expanded HAP value trends and current values.  Using AVM will reduce the time to process each applicant by at least 30 days, and reduce overall program costs by as much as 10%.  <BR><BR>The purpose and intent of this procurement is to acquire full technical AVM services support for the three HAP field offices. <BR>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to solicit proposals for a TURNKEY hoteling or office/business services solution as described below for the following locations and estimated initial requirements: Greater Metropolitan Washington Area (within 25 miles of city center) - 220 persons/seats; Frederick, MD 44 person/seats; Greater Quantico VA area (within 25 miles of city center) 200 persons/seats; and Eatontown NJ - 482 persons/seats.  The VA prefers a single site for each geographic location but will consider offers with more than one site for a given location.  Procurement will be made on a best value basis and the VA may make one or more awards or for the entire initial requirement.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about June 4, 2010 with a closing date of June 14, 2010.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from http://fbo.gov.  Interested Offerors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from that website.  

The VA requires an office services solution akin to a seat management solution to accommodate the sudden increase in VA acquisition and training staff.  The solution requires a turnkey per seat or per person offices services solution where the VA personnel can perform all necessary office functions incident to the efficient performance of their official duties. Such an office services solution is commonplace in the commercial market and is often referred to as an "hoteling" services or business center arrangement where the office space, all ancillary services (reception, mail delivery), and furnishings (desk, chairs, telephone and the like) are provided so that companies can perform normal work functions.  Offerors will not supply any information technology equipment such as computers, printers and so forth as these will be supplied to the persons utilizing the hoteling/office services solution. Such services must be provided in Class A office space.

This is found in large cities where off site "virtual offices" are often required for such tasks as attorney document review, litigation, proposal preparation and so forth.   Such contracts do not involve lease or tenancy rights with the standard commercial terms and conditions with typical terms stating "This agreement is the commercial equivalent of an agreement for accommodation(s) in a hotel. The client accepts that this agreement creates no tenancy interest, leasehold estate, or other real property interest in the clients favor with respect to the accommodations.  The client is being provided the right to share the use of the center"

The VA seeks to make use of standard terms and conditions found in the commercial marketplace as the normal solutions to the staffing crisis are not available to it and mission failure or significant impairment of function is not a viable alternative.

The aforementioned procurement will be made on a best value basis.  All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the agency.  Questions must be submitted in writing via email to frank.flutter@va.gov.

This BAA is intended for the VAi2 Initiative's Industry Innovation Competition (IC). The Industry-IC invites interested contractors to contribute ideas for innovations that increase Veteran access to VA services, reduce or control costs of delivering those services, enhance the performance of VA operations and improve the quality of service that Veterans and their families receive. Specifically, the BAA supports the acquisition of solutions submitted by industry in response to VAi2 topics which will be set forth in the BAA. The BAA allows for multiple awards.

<DESC>Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWN)<br />Data Discrepancy Support (CDDS)
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)</p>
<p>Introduction: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential 8 (a) small businesses that can provide data discrepancy support to providers of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) services, to resolve discrepancies involving administrative, patient, and clinical measures data electronically submitted via a web-based application (known as CROWNWeb) by ESRD providers/facilities.</p>
<p>History: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) End State Renal Disease (ESRD) Program (http://www.cms.gov/center/esrd.asp) currently provides a User Help Desk to support the ESRD Network and Dialysis Facility community which submits patient and clinical data electronically to CMS via the CROWNWeb application.</p>
<p>In February 2009, CMS introduced a phased implementation of CROWNWeb (http://projectcrownweb.org/crown/index.php) to provide a secure, web-based system that captures clinical and administrative data from Medicare-certified dialysis facilities across the United States. The CROWNWeb system will provide a single, central database, used by all ESRD Facilities, Networks, and CMS, as a repository for 100% of clinical data to support various program goals such as National Quality Improvement projects, Public Reporting, and Value Based Purchasing. CROWNWeb data will be important to the calculation of facility-specific scores and percentage payment reductions to implement the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP) established under &sect;153(c) of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008.</p>
<p>Description of the Work: The existing CMS ESRD CROWN Help Desk requires an additional Tier-3 level service provider to resolve open help desk tickets and assist ESRD facilities, Networks, and organizations who submit data in batch on behalf of facilities to correct discrepancies in their CROWNWeb data submissions. Currently, there are two ways to enter data into CROWNWeb: (1) Single User Interface (web-based data entry one record at a time) or by (2) authorized Batch Submitting Organizations (BSOs) who upload files of many records. The batch submission process for ESRD facilities includes providing: patient demographic data, patient admit/discharge data, patient treatment data and patient clinical data. In the current phase of the CROWNWeb implementation there is a data discrepancy error rate of &gt;20% for batch data transmission and a lower error rate associated with the Single User Interface data entry method. Discrepancies arise in the form of data inconsistencies, near matches, logic errors, missing or invalid data pertaining to patient events/treatments (admit, discharge, restart, transplant, transient, change in modality, etc), dates, facility or provider information, multiple patient accounts/IDs, and clinical data related to Form CMS-2728 or Form CMS-2746.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of services required of the Data Discrepancy Support provider may include:<br /><br />&bull; Delivery of Tier-3 Help Desk support to resolve open tickets related to discrepancies in electronic data submission. Support would be performed during regular business hours using government-furnished IT infrastructure and existing help desk applications.<br />&bull; Service delivery metrics reporting including quarterly, monthly, and weekly metrics related to open tickets, incident classification, error category, and resolution/response time. Support will require establishment of service level agreements. Support may require decision analysis using existing Help Desk reporting tools.<br />&bull; Process and/or review standardization, management, and training documentation related to incident prevention, error types and resolution methods. Support will involve regular contributions to enhance the CROWN Help Desk knowledgebase, training documentation, and support the ESRD user community.<br />&bull; Continuous process improvement that promotes root cause analysis, and advances innovation/change proposals for improved accuracy and efficiency in electronic data submission.<br />&bull; Administrative, project management, and communications support.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall have appropriate staff or an appropriate team (with Teaming partners) to respond to User Help Desk tickets and fulfill the above work responsibilities, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Staff with a working knowledge and specialized understanding of ESRD clinical issues, CMS' ESRD Program, including the ESRD Networks and Dialysis Facilities, and the expertise and experience in analyzing CMS administrative data and other ESRD clinical data.<br />2. Staff with a working knowledge and understanding of nephrology and ability to research and resolve errors and discrepancies involving data from multiple sources and forms relating to patient and facility events/treatments.</p>
<p>3. Staff with understanding of database programming, validation rules, and logic checks to identify, analyze, and provide options to prevent recurring errors in electronic data submissions. Contractor's staff must also have the ability to generate dynamic ad-hoc reports to be provided to CMS upon request, as it pertains to the results of the data validation.</p>
<p>Address your company's capabilities</p>
<p>Please provide your experience, knowledge, and capability to provide the following (refer back to the points of work above):</p>
<p>1. Discuss your background and knowledge of ESRD clinical issues, CMS ESRD Program, and expertise and experience in analyzing CMS ESRD administrative and clinical data.</p>
<p>2. Discuss your knowledge and experience with the CMS regulations, policy, and instructions related to the ESRD administrative and clinical data collection.</p>
<p>3. Provide past experience and/or capability in delivery of User Help Desk support services for health care providers.</p>
<p>4. Provide your experience and/or your ability to identify and develop more efficient and effective methods to resolve and reduce the incidence of data discrepancies.</p>
<p>5. Provide your experience in analyzing health care data and clinical information, including information related to significant ESRD areas to support the data discrepancy effort: patient information; CPM values; Form CMS-2728, and Form CMS-2746, from multiple sources/entities.</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Georgette Vlangas (georgette.vlangas@cms.hhs.gov). CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Please address each in order listed above.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to supply arobotic manipulation and positioning system for in-space manufacturing.  This Request forInformation (RFI) pertains to the design and fabrication of the mechanical, electrical,and controlling software for a robotic system.	The specific application is to integratethe robotic system into an electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF3) system that will bedeployed to the International Space Station (ISS).  (A parallel RFI NNL10EBF3ELECTRONBEAMis also being advertised for identifying sources for an electron beam gun for this EBF3system.)  NASA is currently conducting market research to identify firms with specialized expertisein the design, analysis, and fabrication of components for small robotic positioningsystems particularly related to use in space. The robotic system will be designed to operate inside a vacuum chamber within the ISS,requiring operations in 0-g, a vacuum environment of 10-5 torr and higher vacuum, ISScabin pressures of 10 psi, and using ISS input power supply of 28 VDC or 124 VDC.  Thehardware will also be designed to survive high vibration and g-force loads, temperatureexcursions between -50C to +50C, and launch in an unpressurized launch vehicle. Therobotic system will support positioning of multiple interchangeable heads, including butnot limited to an electron beam (EB) gun with attached wire feeder, light machiningtools, and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) sensors. The EB gun, machining tools, and NDEsensors should incorporate the same automatic quick disconnects for the mechanicalconnector at the end of the robotic arm and will be used individually, as is typical in atool-change concept.  Power for the individual interchangeable heads will be external tothe robotic arm, so the arm does not need to accommodate power connectors for the variousheads, but must allow for the power cabling to the top of each interchangeable head. Thewire feeder will require a second automatic quick disconnect at the attachment point tothe EB gun to enable automatic changing between a variety of wire feed stocks.	Therobotic system may be Cartesian, cylindrical, or arm based with the goal of maximizingthe working volume within a minimum total chamber volume. The robotic positioning systemshall enable coordinated, multi-axial motion enabling precise following of a tool pathwhile maintaining a constant velocity at the electron beam head.  Additionally, amotorized turntable, or turret assembly, is needed to position multiple base plates orbuild stubs. This base-plate fixture must be removable via a simple or automatic quickdisconnect system. The size and weight of the system and supporting components should beminimized in order to facilitate integration with the ISS. The robotics must includesafety features to prevent harm to personnel, the ISS, and the electron beam freeformfabrication equipment.The following specifications are in draft form and therefore subject to change. Thesespecifications are intended to depict the general performance envelope. Fabrication volume: 6 inch cubePositioning accuracy: +/- 0.001 inch in Cartesian spacePositioning velocities: 0.0  50.0 (+/- 0.1) inches per minute while maintainingpositioning accuracyPower: 100 Watts peak. Respondents should have demonstrated capability and experience in the design, analysis,fabrication, and testing of robotic systems, preferably with experience on systems forspace applications. Respondents shall emphasize how their stated capabilities andexperience relate to the specific performance requirements and challenges associated withdeveloping components for space applications. Respondents shall list specific missionswhere their hardware has flown, if publically available. Respondents may offer responses to any or all of the following:1.  Design, analysis, and fabrication of components for small robotic positioning systemsparticularly related to use in space applications.2.  Costs:  a) Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs to design the robotic systemand associated hardware to space-qualified requirements plus build three units broken outat a minimum in the following categories: design, testing, and fabrication/delivery. (b)Provide assumptions used in development of ROM costs.3. Delivery: (a) Provide an estimated delivery time frame. (b) What are the major risksand foreseen or unforeseen challenges to meeting the delivery - how can they be overcome?4. Experience: (a) Interested parties must have experience with design, analysis,fabrication, and testing of robotic systems; specific experience with designing andfabricating robotic systems used in reduced gravity and vacuum environments for spaceapplications, is desired. In addition to the above information, responses must include the following: name andaddress of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number ofemployees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone,and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company,joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub)or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years(highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of eachprocurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). Information, such as trade secrets and commercial or financial information provided tothe Government on a privileged or confidential basis that, if released, would result incompetitive harm should be identified and marked as Proprietary. Government civil servantemployees are subject to the non-disclosure obligations of a felony criminal statute, theTrade Secrets Act, 18 USC 1905. NASA will likely provide proprietary information to itssupport service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party proprietaryinformation in confidence.  Company names and identifiers will be removed from theinformation prior to providing it to support service contractor  personnel. As such, tothe extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as orconstrued to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a)about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to support servicecontractors and (b) submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consentto such handling and disclosure of submitted information. Responses should not exceed 10 pages total, in 12 point font, not including diagrams,pictures, or figures.  Preferred file format is Microsoft Word, Power Point, Excel orAdobe (PDF).  Existing documents that describe suitable existing products or proposedproducts are acceptable.  The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategydevelopment. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on anon-attribution basis. Providing data and information that is limited or restricted foruse by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limiteddata/information is not solicited. No information or questions received will be posted toany website or public access location. NASA does not plan to respond to the individualresponses. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offeror(s) responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and theGovernment does not presently intend to award a contract, nor will the Government pay forinformation solicited. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are notconsidered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract..Inputs shall be compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements concerninglimitations on export controlled items. Technical questions should be directed to: Dr. Bill Seufzer at: Bill.Seufzer@nasa.gov.Procurement related questions should be directed to: Ms. Teresa Hass at:Teresa.M.Hass@nasa.gov. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to supply anelectron beam system for in-space manufacturing.  The specific application is tointegrate the electron beam gun as a changeable tool into an electron beam freeformfabrication (EBF3) system that will be deployed to the International Space Station (ISS). (A parallel RFI NNL10EBF3ROBOTICSYSTEM is also being advertised for identifying sourcesfor a robotic positioning system for this EBF3 system.)

The hardware will also be designed to survive high vibration and g-force loads,temperature excursions between -50C to +50C, and launch in an unpressurized launchvehicle. The electron beam gun will be mated to a robotic positioning system that willalso support other tools, therefore the gun should incorporate automatic quickdisconnects to facilitate interchange with other tools. Electrical disconnect of the gunwill not be required. The size and weight of the electron beam gun and all supportinghardware and electronic components should be minimized in order to facilitate integrationwith ISS. For scaling reference, the targeted build volume is approximately 6 inches by 6inches by 6 inches.  Liquid cooling of the electron beam gun and high voltage powersupply is permitted, using on-board cooling system on the ISS, to minimize heat expulsioninto the ISS ambient environment.  The electron beam gun will be used to melt aluminum,titanium and ferrous alloys; however, x-ray generation should be minimized.  The electronbeam gun should provide a power output of approximately 2 kW at a maximum acceleratingvoltage of 20 kV utilizing ISS standard input power of 124 VDC. The electron beam gunshould have the capability to deflect, raster, and vary the beam from sharp to softfocus. The electron beam gun must include appropriate safety interlocks thatautomatically shut down the electron beam gun in the event of power, operationalanomalies, or inadequate vacuum (to prevent turning the beam on while the door is open),and shielding of electron beam gun and associated power supplies to protect from coronadischarge in the reduced pressure environment in the ISS, to prevent harm to personnel,ISS and the electron beam freeform fabrication equipment.Respondents should have demonstrated capability and experience in the design, analysis,fabrication, and testing of electron beam gun systems, preferably with experience onsystems for space applications. Respondents shall emphasize how their stated capabilities and experience relate to thespecific performance requirements and challenges associated with developing componentsfor space applications. Respondents may offer responses to any or all of the following:1.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Programs Office has a requirement for high resolution ortho-rectified imagery over the City of Cheyenne, Warren Airforce Base and the surrounding areas of Laramie County, Wyoming. The USGS has the opportunity to obtain all of this orthoimagery from the City of Cheyenne, Wyoming for 25% of the cost of the entire project because other governmental entities and local governments are contributing to this project.

<DESC><p><br />This is a sources sought notice and is not a request for proposal or bid. The intent of this sources sought notice is to determine if there small businesses that are qualified and capable of performing IT Production services at a fair market price for the U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM's) anticipated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Production - Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) contract. The USSOCOM Special Operations Research, Development, and Acquisition Center (SORDAC) in Tampa, FL, is seeking a Capability Statement from all qualified Small Businesses contractors.</p>
<p>The TACLAN Program provides Special Operational Forces (SOF) operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. TACLAN provides the automation infrastructure and common-user applications to interconnect deployed SOF headquarters, main operating locations, tactical teams and liaison elements. Numerous joint, service, and SOF deployed automation programs/efforts operate on TACLAN to gain connectivity to SOF Information Environment (SIE) networks. TACLAN merges numerous deployed SOF automation efforts into a consolidated infrastructure program consisting of hardware and SOF validated software applications. The TACLAN program includes, but is not limited to,TACLAN Suites, Mission Planning Kits (MPKs) and Field Computing Devices (FCDs). Each TACLAN Suite consists of three easily transportable, multiple integrated networks; 60 general use laptops; 10 intelligence laptops; routers; and ancillary equipment used by SOF Command and Control Nodes, forming a deployed Local Area Network (LAN). MPKs consist of four general use laptops and ancillary equipment used by SOF teams for detailed mission planning support. FCDs are small handheld computing devices used by the most forward deployed SOF teams to automatically interface with the TACLAN suite via tactical communications.</p>
<p>At a summary level, the anticipated scope for the TACLAN Production acquisition includes:</p>
<p>* Production<br />-- Program Planning and Management<br />-- Product Design, Fabrication, Integration<br />-- Systems Engineering and Technical Support<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Market research<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; White papers<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Analysis, testing, recommendations, and implementation of new technology<br />-- Software Integration<br />-- Test and Evaluation<br />-- Configuration Management<br />-- Information Assurance/Security Accreditation<br />-- Quality Assurance<br />-- Meeting/Conference Support</p>
<p>* Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)<br />-- ILS Plan<br />-- Product Procurement<br />-- Technical and Sustainment Support<br />-- Warranty<br />-- Provisioning and Spares<br />-- Technical Manuals<br />-- Training (New Equipment Training and Sustainment Training)<br />-- Fielding and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Support; Fielding Plans, Disposal Plans<br />-- Software Licensing/Maintenance</p>
<p>* Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the TACLAN contractor will provide all personnel, facilities, materials, equipment, software and services necessary to perform the tasks outlined above.

<p>USSOCOM's current TACLAN Production contract (H92222-08-D-0017) expires<br />31 March 2011. The Government anticipates a single, small business set aside contract for the C4I Production - TACLAN contract. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is anticipated to be 541519 (Other Computer Related Services), with a small business size standard of 150 employees. If you believe a different NAICS Code is more appropriate please provide the recommended NAICS code and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>All interested Small Businesses with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit a CAPABILITY STATEMENT consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures which should include:</p>
<p>1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.<br />2) Identification of the type of Small Businesses (i.e., SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.).<br />3) Past experience with IT Production work.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Offices intent to award an interim bridge contract to extend the services of the current Logistics Support Services contract, for a period of performance beginning 1 August 2010  30 November 2010.  A competitive contract was awarded 1 August 2004 to World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069, Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  The interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, W9124L-10-C-0002, which was awarded as a sole source on 1 April 2010 to World Technical Services Inc. and will expire 31 July 2010.  This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The bridge contract will be issued to the current contractor, World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069 Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  The contract type is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract.  This bridge contract will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Sill Installation pending award of a competitive 8(a) follow-on contract.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this four-month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 561210.   Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be faxed to (580)442-3819, ATTN:  Angela Triplett.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a modification on a sole source basis to Precision Machine & Supply, Inc., 3218 East Main Street, Lewiston ID 83501.  The justification is Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This procurement is to purchase ten additional Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) control systems and ten additional Hydraulic Control Manifolds which were specially designed, manufactured, and supplied under Contract No. R06PC30062 to modernize pressure regulating valves (PRVs) at Hoover Dam.  The modernization required the following:  (1) changing the control of the PRV from mechanical to digital; (2) replacing the components operated by lake water and the mechanical linkages to the turbine with oil-hydraulic systems and digital hydraulic drivers; and (3) linking computer intelligence electronically from the UCM PLCs to the PRV's controls to operate the modernized PRV.  In order to achieve the modernization, Precision Machine was required, in part, to perform the following work:  (1) design, build, and install a PLC control system to operate the PRV that communicates with the Unit Control Modernization (UCM) control system and (2) design, manufacture, and install a control manifold to properly distribute the oil for moving the cylinder.  In response to Precision Machine's requirements, Controlled Motion Solutions (Comoso) and American Governor provided designs and schematics.  Precision Machine required that the Comoso's hydraulic manifold correctly control the flow of high pressure hydraulic oil into and out of the hydraulic cylinder in response to commands received from the American Governor controller.  Precision Machine and its subcontractors have exclusivity agreements to the design and systems and they are proprietary.  The additional quantities of the PLC control systems and Hydraulic Control Manifolds must be identical in design, manufacture, assembly, and function to those already provided for on the modernized PRVs under Contract No. R06PC30062.
This notice of intent is not to be considered a request for quotations or competitive proposals, however, all capability statements received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    
All responses to this special notice shall be provided to Rita Horkan, LC-10212, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470, Facsimile (702) 293-8036, or via email at rhorkan@.usbr.gov.
The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f)(4).

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Capital Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with O8O Studio, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13, for services related to the Lease of Hurricane Simulator for 2010 Air Venture Show at the National Weather Service exhibit during the 2010 EAA Air Venture Show. To enhance NOAA presence at AirVenture (Oshkosh, WI) this summer, plans are being made to incorporate a Hurricane Simulator (HS) as part of the exhibit. The HS produces winds of a Category 1 hurricane, including video, sound and vibration in a self-operating unit. The National Weather Service (NWS) exhibit traditionally has been comprised of several computer/Internet terminals where real time products were demonstrated to encourage interaction with the public. NWS brochures also have been distributed. A dynamic attraction like the HS, we feel, will bring additional people to the exhibit allowing us to effectively reach more of the public with our message. Several private sector exhibitors at AirVentue use high-tech attractions to draw the prople in; having the HS at the NWS exhibit will help "level the playing field". Additional information about AirVenture can be found at http://www-airventure.org/. Details on the Hurricane Simulator are at http://gizmoexhibits.com/. Period of Performance: July 25, 2010 through August 4, 2010. O8O Studio, Inc. is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 332999 with a small business size standard of 500. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Gina.E.Lee@noaa.gov or faxed to (301) 713-0810 by June 10, 2010. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-41. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please refer to NWWB0230-10-11898 for this requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERY: "THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE PRIME CONTRACTOR UNDER THE REMEDIAL ACTION CONTRACT EP-S1-06-03, WHICH USES RECOVERY ACT FUNDS." <br />
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Remedial Action Contract (RAC) for remedial services including various engineering services such as designing remedial actions, enforcement support including oversight, remedial investigations and feasibility studies, at sites located within the six New England states. This requirement has orders funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). Due to EPA's decision to use ARRA funds on the existing EP-S1-06-03 contract and the unanticipated increase in workload/funding as a result of this ARRA work, the request to increase specific Contract Line Items has become necessary. This action will result in a modification to increase the Base Period Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) 002 - Subcontracting Pool and 003 - Other Direct Costs (ODC), which will result in a Contract Ceiling increase for the Base Period. The anticipated requested Subcontract Pool amount is $6,088,592 and the ODC amount is $1,240,573. This action will increase the total Base Period by $7,329,165 to $64,816,837, which is necessary to continue to provide the critically needed services under this Remedial Action Contract through the Base Period. Also, the increase will allow services to continue without interruptions to the day to day operations of this contract. Without an increase for the two line items, progress will be severely impeded on a key ARRA construction task order and severely impact ARRA outlays. Additionally, there will be insufficient capacity to complete the ARRA project/task order and continue existing work on other task orders for the duration of the Base Period, including a remedial action task order utilizing the same technology as the ARRA funded Site.</p>
<p>This unusual and compelling circumstance of the increase in work load and funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act has occurred during the final eighteen months of the Base Period (5 years) of this contract. This request to increase CLIN's 002 and 003 will allow Region 1 to continue with the mission to protect the environment and to meet ARRA goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The statutory acceptance permitting other than full and open competition for this requisition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency, as implemented by paragraph 6.302-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>
<p>The justification for other than full and open competition document will be posted after issuance of this modification in accordance with FAR 6.305.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. <br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 42 is to obligate $7,729 in funding in support of Work Assignment 2-201, Amendment 4. The period of Performance of WA 2-201 remains from July 29, 2009 through September 30, 2010. Work Assignment 2-201 is now funded to $92,729.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Modification 42 also obligates $93,145 in initial funding in support of Work Assignment 2-203. The period of Performance of WA 2-203 is May 20, 2010 through September 30, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-201 of Contract EP-C-05-046, the contractor supports EPA in providing ways to increase information sharing and improve collaboration between EPA Regions, EPA Headquarters and the Indian Health Service (IHS) working on Clean Water Indian Set Aside (CWISA) projects using ARRA funds. In particular Amendment 4 supports the preparation for, participation in, and note taking of ARRA tribal set aside conference calls in support of post-meeting activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-203 of Contract EP-C-05-046, the contractor supports EPA's assistance to Iowa and Kansas in its oversight of ARRA grant projects in order to ensure successful implementation of the ARRA requirements. The contractor will conduct site visits for 79 water projects (47clean water and 32 drinking water) in Iowa and 45 water projects (22 clean water and 23 drinking water) in Kansas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<a href="mailto:amanda.andrews@usace.army.mil">USACE Geospatial Center</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC), is the developer of the family of Combat Terrain Information Systems (CTIS).  Those systems include the Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) in 3 distinct versions the Deployable, the Light and the Base.  The AGC is responsible for supporting the software architecture of these systems, supporting research and development projects and a providing a global data sharing architecture designed to share data and project collaboration across the Army topographic community.<BR> <BR>Terra Suite software is the baseline 3D imagery analysis software for the Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) family of systems and has been integrated into the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) baseline architecture for the DTSS.  The Terra Suite software is used on numerous AGC developed and supported topographic systems and is found in the Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) of every topographic unit in the U.S. Army. The Terra Suite software suite is being taught at the Army Terrain Analyst (21Y) Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) schools the Basic Non-Commissioned Officers Course (BNCOC) the Advanced Non-Commissioned Officers Course (ANCOC) and the Terrain Warrant Officers Course.  The entire family of Combat Terrain Information Systems (CTIS) / Digital Topographic Support Systems (DTSS) is reliant on the Terra Suite software to perform the critical 3D GIS, mapping and imagery  analysis functions for Army terrain units deployed in combat in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom as well as for unit operations in garrison.  The maintenance service provides licensing, software improvements, updates and technical support for the Terra Suite software. Software development services are occasionally required for the AGC efforts of research, development, testing, evaluation and integration necessary to keep the combat systems current and technologically relevant for the life of the systems. Training is required to familiarize new employees and project engineers with the background and experience required to use and teach the Terra Suite software to Army terrain analysts at all combat maneuver echelons.  The software is further used for research, development, testing, and evaluation programs, and is included with other software as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tool by Army topographic and intelligence systems developed or supported by the AGC.   <BR>    <BR>As such, the AGC has, for five years, purchased the Terra Suite family 3D visualization software, software maintenance and subscription services and occasional software integration support required by this architecture.  The DTSS Terra Suite architecture includes TerraBuilder, TerraExplorer Pro, TerraExplorer, Command and Control/Mission Planning (C2MP), TerraFuser and TerraGate.  These software modules are part of the  Army Battle Command Architecture and are in use in more than 300 DTSS systems  across the Army.   <BR> <BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if there are sources capable of satisfying the government's requirement for the acquisition of the TerraSuite family of software and services in support of the DTSS program and systems, AGC data sharing architecture, research and development.  <BR><BR> <BR>NO PROPOSALS are requested or accepted under this RFI.  Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope and potential alternative means of meeting the government's requirement is sought.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 511210.   <BR> <BR>The AGC is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting capability packages from industry on the requirements below.  Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages and must address the following areas:  (1)  provide for purchase as an authorized retailer of the Terra Suite family of products; software, licenses, maintenance and subscription services; (2) knowledge and experience on the DTSS and ABCS software architecture testing and approval requirements for the insertion of subsequent Terra Suite software versions and new capabilities; (3) knowledge and experience  related to the integration and development of Terra Suite software routines and scripts into existing software interfaces;  (4) knowledge and experience related to design, development, management and sustainment of the AGC Globe project; (5) knowledge and experience related to design, development, evaluation, and incorporation of innovative state-of-the-art web based presentation of TerraGate networked  servers and datebases for access by TerrExplorer Pro interface.  <BR> <BR>Interested sources are encouraged to submit company literature in response to this RFI.  Any submission of such company literature will be treated separate from, and will have no  bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future Request for Proposals (RFP).   <BR> <BR>The AGC will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 21 June 2010, 10:00 AM.  POC for this action is: Elvie A. Thompson, Contracting Officer, Elvie.a.thompson@usace.army.mil  <BR> <BR>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, INVITATION FOR BID, OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">WAWF INSTRUCTIONS </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">is recommended.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES FAR PART 13.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-40.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 and is a small business set aside with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for Ricin Biothreat and Elisa Kits that meets or exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>Non-Coated Ricin ELISA Quantity: 40ea<br />Rinin Biothreat Kits Quantity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40ea</p>
<p>RICIN TEST: FOR THE RAPID QUALITATIVE DETERMINATION OF RICINUS COMMUNIS AGGLUTININ II (RICIN TOXIN)</p>
<p>USE:<br />The Ricin test strip is a hand-held biological agent detection and identification device for Ricinus Communis Agglutinin II the causative agent for Ricin poisoning. It is intended for use in the field for performing rapid analysis contained in samples collected from the environment. The Ricin test strip is NOT a diagnostic device, and is not intended for testing on samples collected from humans or intended for any medical use. The lateral flow devices (LFDs) are reported to enable the rapid, less than 15 minutes, detection of ricin in various environmental samples.</p>
<p>LFDs must employ antibodies which tightly bind compounds referred to as antigens. The high specificity and affinity of antibodies for their respective antigens must enable them to detect specific antigens at concentrations well below 1 ppm in the presence of other compounds in vast excess.</p>
<p>The Ricin ELISA kit must employ a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of ricin in environmental samples and has been adapted to the detection of ricin in food samples. This ELISA must successfully be applied to the detection of ricin in juices (apple, orange, pineapple, prune, V-8), milk (2%), infant formula (soy-based), soda (cola), produce (grapes, lettuce, grapefruit), breads (wheat bread, &lsquo;everything' bagel, tortilla), milk chocolate, sunscreen, body gel/lotion, and shampoo with conditioner at levels less than 1 mg/kg (&lt; 1 ppm).</p>
<p>TESTING PRINCIPALS:<br />ELISAs must employ antibodies, proteins which tightly bind compounds referred to as antigens. The high specificity and affinity of antibodies for their respective antigens must enable them to detect specific antigens at concentrations well below 1 ppm in the presence of other compounds in vast excess.</p>
<p>TESTING PRINCIPALS:<br />LFDs must provide a rapid qualitative test to detect the presence of Ricin Toxin. The test should utilize a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively detect the presence of biological threat agents in aqueous samples. The assay should be conducted by the addition of sample into a test device Sample Port and observing the formation of colored labeled antibody, than migrates via capillary action along the membrane. A positive sample should react with the agent-specific labeled antibody conjugate and form a line in the S (sample) Window. In the absence of the specific agent, no line will develop, suggesting a negative result. To serve as a control for the procedure, a colored line in the C (control) Window should always appear regardless of the presence or absence of specific biological agents in the sample. The test should be invalid if no colored line appears in the C (control) Window.</p>
<p>VALADATION:<br />These methods should be validated by the FDA and acceptable for uses that meet the specifications for the rapid detection of the stated toxin.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (george.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov) before 1:00 pm (1300) ET on 01 June 2010.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. <br /><br />Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," and 2) Price. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price.</p>

<DESC><p>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-10-1068201-02.</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. (iv) This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541519 and the small business size standard is $25M. The Government intends to issue a time and material / Labor Hour Contract for a base plus two option years. The Government reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.</p>
<p>(v) &amp; (vi): GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is seeking qualified sources capable of Internet Monitoring and Analysis Support Services (IMSS). Please see the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Other Terms and Conditions document for more details on this requirement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors -Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709. Offerors are required to submit their proposals in three separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>Volume 1 - Technical</p>
<p>Shall include supporting documentation as attachments to the technical volume, such as resumes, project management plan, Conflict of Interest Plan, and certifications. This volume shall contain the Technical Approach and not be a reiteration of the SOW. This portion of the proposal shall exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of each offer. Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail a technical approach that will meet the requirements specified in the SOW (attachment #1). The technical volume shall not exceed 25 pages and be submitted electronically in PDF format. The page limitation does not include Cover page, Table of Contents, Resumes, Certifications, Project Management plan, or Conflict of Interest Plan.</p>
<p>Volume 2- Past Performance</p>
<p>This volume shall describe the Offeror's success in performing comparable contracts/orders. The Past Performance Volume shall be no more than three pages, i.e., no more than one page narrative per contract/order and submitted electronically in PDF format. The Offeror shall submit directly to the Government:</p>
<p>A list of three contracts/orders, similar in scope, duration, and price to the work described in the SOW. The Offeror shall adhere to the following guidelines in generating this list:</p>
<p>o Contracts or orders must have been completed within three years of the quote due date. <br />o The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort.<br />o The list should include both a contractual and technical point of contact (email addresses and phone numbers) for each of the contracts/orders. <br />o If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. <br />o The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. <br />o If the contract/order is not described in the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.</p>
<p>The Offeror should also send the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to the RFP (Attachment 2) to the sources that it identifies in the Past Performance Volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, Internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFP close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each Offeror as well as data obtained from possible other sources such as the Nation Institute of Health's (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS) or the Department of Defense's (DOD) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance.<br />Government:</p>
<p>Volume 3 - Pricing Proposal</p>
<p>The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitute deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable. This volume shall include proposed labor categories, labor rates (fully-loaded), level-of-effort, and materials / Other Direct Costs / and Travel (if applicable) for a base plus 2 option periods. The pricing proposal shall be submitted on the attached Microsoft Excel Sheet (Attachment 3) with the cells unlocked.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals and are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 Technical Proposal</p>
<p>FACTOR 1) Technical Understanding: The proposed content will be evaluated on the ability to demonstrate that the offeror understands the technical requirements and has a coherent, feasible and efficient approach to providing the services required.</p>
<p>The proposal shall:</p>
<p>a) demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the SOW; <br />b) specify the contractor's current infrastructure for internet monitoring and analysis support services to include any (if applicable) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTs), Government off the Shelf (GOTs), or contractor proprietary software; <br />c) present an approach to monitoring FDA Regulated Products and tracking affiliated networks; <br />d) presents an approach to reporting and notifying the FDA; <br />e) delineate a detailed and well organized project plan and staffing plan that demonstrates all aspects of the services to be performed</p>
<p>FACTOR 2) Relevant Experience</p>
<p>This section of the technical proposal shall include a written narrative describing two to four projects that are similar to this effort in terms of scope, complexity, importance to the agency's mission, and size. The proposed projects that are included in the narrative should involve internet monitoring. Projects listed may include contracts with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. The narrative shall emphasize any situations in which the Offeror conducted internet monitoring, tracked affiliated networks, and monitored regulated products, such as pharmaceuticals, bilogics, vaccines, medical devices etc...</p>
<p>The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical apprach minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical approach fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technical approach exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past Performance: The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that bidder's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the bidder as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>
<p>VOLUME 3: PRICE</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two 12 month option periods. Price is less important than technical and past performance. As proposals are rated more equal technically pricing will prevail. The FDA will evaluate the proposed labor rates and bottom-line price by making a price reasonableness determination. FDA will determine price reasonableness by utilizing one or several of the following price realism techniques: reviewing the proposed ceiling amount and labor rates against amounts and rates previously paid by the FDA for similar work, amounts previously charged by the contractor for similar work, standard market labor rates for similar labor categories, and determining whether the overall proposed level of effort / labor mix reflects the contractor's proposed technical approach and meets the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work. If applicable FDA reserves the right to review the contractor's labor rates on the General Service Administration (GSA) (if applicable) website and seek price information from other commercial and Government sources. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY Section 508 Standards This contract qualifies for an exception to Section 508. As such, Section 508 standards requirements will not apply. (xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. (xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (APR 2010), applies to this acquisition (See clauses in attachment #1)</p>
<p>(xvi &amp; xvii) All questions must be submitted in writing to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Wednesday June 9, 2010. Answers to all questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation no later than Monday June 14, 2010. Proposals must be submitted electronically to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than June 21, 2010 at 2pm ET.</p>

	(end of provision)

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:

Line Item 0001:  One (1) Mass Spectrometer. ***

Introduction

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and services to fabricate, install, and test one Mass Spectrometer.

Background    

NISTs Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement for a Mass Spectrometer to be used for projects involving the qualitative characterization of peptides by mass spectrometry.  These projects include the analysis, by computer algorithms, of spectra (ion trap spectra and linear collision cell spectra) produced by mass spectrometers to assign peptide sequences to be compiled into reference libraries used by research laboratories to discover disease-related biomarkers.  Another project involves characterization of biological drugs to identify the presence of and sites of a large array of chemical modifications.  Both projects involve the analysis of a large number of biological samples containing a large number of peptides and modifications.
The required instrument shall be capable of analyzing complex mixtures of peptides by electrospray ionization in order to produce high quality tandem mass spectra (to be included in the reference library) as well as capable of making qualitative measurements of samples to identify peptides and the presence and location of chemical modifications.

Minimum Requirements

The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below.  All items must be new.  Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.

A.	General Requirements:

1)	The mass spectrometer must be able to perform MSn experiments (where n= 1, 2, or 3) at high scan speeds to analyze complex mixtures of peptides eluting from a HPLC column.  
2)	Fragmentation of peptides must be done on a chromatographic time scale with a choice of rapid switching between collision-induced dissociation (CID), higher collision energies to optimize fragments in the low m/z region, or electron transfer dissociation (ETD).
3)	The mass spectrometer must collect high quality (high signal-to-noise ratio) MS and MSn spectra with reproducible peptide fragmentation run-to-run and instrument-to-instrument. 
4)	The mass spectrometer must have the ability to collect MS and dependent MSn scans in the mass range of m/z 200-2000 with a choice of either low mass resolution or high mass resolution and high mass accuracy for each scan.
5)	Electrospray source must have interchangeable parts to perform ionization (at normal or elevated temperature) of HPLC effluent with flow rates between 50 nL/min to 1 mL/min.

B.	Minimum Requirements for Performance:

1)	High mass resolution measurements must be 60,000 at full width at half maximum (FWHM) for m/z 400 at a spectrum repetition rate of 1 second. 
2)	High mass accuracy measurements must be < 3 ppm with external standard and < 1 ppm with internal standard.
3)	Must be able to acquire at least 50 MS high resolution scans (60,000 at m/z 400) and 200 MS2 scans (at unit resolution) in under one minute.

C.	Minimum Requirements for Computer and Software:

1)	A computer, with Windows operating system, a 100 Gb hard drive and a DVD+RW/+R drive, to be used for programming instrument methods and storing data.
2)	Includes software to control all parts of the mass spectrometer, perform automated instrument tuning and calibration, and to view data during real-time acquisition and post-acquisition.  Software to perform peptide identifications is not required.
3)	Instrument software must provide additional control for an HPLC and autosampler.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFKPR00-10-12322 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is set aside for Small Business. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard is 541990 and $7.0M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Marine Mammal Conservation Division has a requirement to conduct Sea Turtle Stranding Network surveys at the Principal Nesting Beaches of the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle in Tamaulipas, Mexcio. In the U.S., an active and organized sea turtle stranding network has been developed and continues to be improved in order to quantify the seasonality, species composition, stock structure, life history stage, sex ratio, and distribution of turtles that wash ashore dead or alive. The stranding network endeavors to identify both anthropogenic and natural casual factors of mortality with the hope of identifying mortality factors and implementing sound management and conservation measures. Due to its endangered status, strandings involving the Kemp's Ridley, Lepidochelys kempii receive a great deal of attention from federal regulatory agencies charged with enforcing the Endangered Species Act as well as fishing industry interest whose fishing activities may be affected by management actions. The epicenter of Kemp's Ridley sea turtle nesting is located between La Pesca, in the state of Tamaulipas and Lechuguillas, in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Stranding data collected in Mexico from 2001 to the early part of 2009 have shown that significant strandings are occurring, both during the nesting season and throughout the remainder of the year. Stranding data are a source of important information relative to population structure as well as mortality factors operating on the population. The specified work will facilitate the continuation of stranding surveys on the Tamaulipas, Mexico coastline to document mortality and to evaluate potential causative factors. More data are needed to understand the level of sea turtle strandings and to evaluate the trend(s) in strandings. Prior to the initiation of stranding sueveys in Mexico in 2001, data in Mexico were anecdotal at best and were only recorded during the months of nesting activity at the principal nesting beaches, and then, only when time permitted. Mexico implements a shrimp closure which coincides with the Kemp's Ridley nesting season so that this period likely represents low levels of sea turtle strandings. Objectives: Conduct year-round, sea turtle stranding surveys along the Tamaulipas coastline of Mexico. Ensure that accurate location and detailed stranding data are collected for each documented stranding. Enhance knowledge of mortality factors on the population through thorough documentation and reporting of results, including necropsy data as practicable. Tasks: 1). Conduct patrols three times/week from the Tepehuajes, Rancho Nuevo, Barra del Tordo, Altamira and La Pesca camps. These patrols will cover the prime sectors of the Kimp Ridley's habitat. This work will be accomplished during the period of September 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011; 2). Locate patrol leaders permanently at each of the five field camps and patrol leaders are responsible for security at each of the camps to prevent vandalism which translates into annual savings to the program; 3). Collect GPS location data for each stranding location, as well as detailed biological information on each stranded turtle that includes checking for internal and external tags. Complete standardized reporting forms and archive data in a database for managing stranding data; 4). Perform necropsies on dead stranded sea turtles whenever practical and the cause(s) examined. Standardized necropsy forms will be used. Stranded sea turtles will be examined for external tags and scanned for the presence of PIT tags. Turtles will also be scanned for wire-coded tags when a magnetometer is available. Deliverables: A Progress Report of activities and results will be submitted by February 15, 2011 and a Final Project Report will be submitted by August 31, 2011. The progress report shall include quantitative data collected by the stranding network, including standard strandings form for each turtle encountered and all necropsy results in standard format. Summary tables shall be included that tabulate strandings by species by week by geographical areas in the standard format. The final report shall include complete results and analyses, including maps of the locations of the standings and results of PIT tag and wire-coded tag scanning. The resulting purchase order shall be awarded on a best value basis and will be firm fixed price. Period of Performance: September 1, 2010 to August 31, 2012. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) - Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) - Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit.

INSURANCE <br /><br />a. The Contractor will secure, pay the premiums for and keep in force until the expiration of this contract, and any renewal thereof, adequate insurance as provided below, such insurance to specifically include liability assumed by the contractor under this contract.</p>
<p>(1) Workman's compensation insurance as required by law of the State.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive bodily injury liability insurance with limits of not less than $500,000 for each accident.</p>
<p>(3) Property damage liability with a limit of not less than $100,000 for each accident.</p>

<p>b. Each policy of insurance will contain an endorsement that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government's interest will not be effective unless the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice of cancellation or change to the Contracting Officer at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the aforementioned actions. When the coverage is provided by self-insurance, the Contractor will not change or decrease the coverage without the Administrative Contracting Officer's prior approval.</p>
<p>c. A certificate of each policy of insurance will be furnished to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) days after notice of award certifying, among other things, that the policy contains the aforesaid endorsement. The insurance companies providing the above insurance will be satisfactory to the Government. Notices of policy changes will be furnished to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>11. HANDLING OF DATA <br /><br />a. The Contractor in performance of this contract may have need for access to and use of various types of data and information in the possession of the Government which the Government obtained under conditions that restrict the Government's right to use and disclose the data and information, or which may be of such a nature that its dissemination or use other than in the performance of this contract would be adverse to the interests of the Government or other parties. Therefore, the Contractor agrees to abide by any restrictive use conditions on such data and not to:</p>
<p>(1) Knowingly disclose such data and information to others without written authorization from the Contracting Officer, unless the Government has made the data and information available to the public; nor</p>
<p>(2) Use for any purpose other than the performance of this contract that data which bears a restrictive marking or legend.</p>
<p>b. In the event the work required to be performed, under this contract requires access to proprietary data of other companies, the Contractor will obtain agreements from such other companies for such use unless such data is provided or made available to the Contractor by the Government. Two copies of such company-to-company agreements shall be furnished promptly to the Contracting Officer for information only. These agreements will prescribe the scope of authorized use or disclosure, and other terms and conditions to be agreed upon between the parties. It is agreed by the Contractor that any such data, whether obtained by the Contractor pursuant to the aforesaid agreement or from the Government, will be protected from unauthorized use or disclosure to any individual, corporation, or organization so long as it remains proprietary.</p>
<p>c. Through formal training in company policy and procedures, the Contractor agrees to make employees aware of the absolute necessity to maintain the confidentiality of data and information, as required above, and further aware of the sanctions which may be imposed for divulging either the proprietary data of other companies or data that is obtained from the Government to anyone except as authorized. The Contractor will obtain from each employee engaged in any effort connected with this contract an agreement, in writing, which shall in substance provide that such employee will not during his/her employment by the Contractor, or thereafter, disclose to others or use for his/her own benefit or the future benefit of any individual any trade secrets, confidential information, or proprietary/restricted data (to include Government "For Official Use Only") received in connection with the work under this contract. The Contractor will furnish a sample form of this agreement to the Contracting Officer within 10 days after award.<br /><br />d. The Contractor agrees to hold the Government harmless and indemnify the Government as to any cost/loss resulting from the unauthorized use of disclosure of third party data or software by the Contractor, its employees, subcontractors, or agents.</p>
<p>e. The Contractor agrees to include the substance of this provision in all subcontracts awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will consider case-by-case exceptions from this requirement for individual subcontracts in the event that:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor considers the application of the prohibitions of this provision to be inappropriate and unnecessary in the case of a particular subcontractor; <br />(2) The subcontractor provides a written statement affirming absolute unwillingness to perform absent some relief from the substance of this prohibition; <br />(3) Use of an alternate subcontract source would reasonably detract from the quality of effort; and <br />(4) The Contractor provides the Contracting Officer timely written advance notice of these and any other extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>f. Except as the Contracting Officer specifically authorizes in writing, upon completion of all work under this contract the Contractor will return all such data and information obtained from the Government, including all copies, modifications, adaptations, or combinations thereof, to the Contracting Officer. Data obtained from another company will be disposed of in accordance with the Contractor's agreement with that company, or, if the agreement makes no provision for disposition, will be returned to that company. The Contractor will further certify in writing to the Contracting Officer that all copies, modifications, adaptations or combinations of such data or information, which cannot reasonably be returned to the Contracting Officer (or to a company), have been deleted from the Contractor's (and any subcontractor's) records and destroyed.</p>
<p>g. These restrictions do not limit the Contractor's (or subcontractor's) right to use and disclose any data and information obtained from another source without restriction.</p>
<p>12. DOT INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(1) Work under a task order may involve access to sensitive information, as described in paragraph d. below that will not be disclosed by the Contractor unless authorized by the CO or designee. To protect sensitive information, the Contractor will provide training to any Contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such authorization. Contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular task order.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor will ensure that Contractor employees are: (1) citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service documentation; and (2) have background investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management.</p>
<p>(3) The contractor will include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources.</p>
<p>(4) Sensitive Information is proprietary data or other information that, if subject to unauthorized access, modification, loss or misuse, could adversely affect national interest, conduct of Federal programs, or privacy of individuals specified in the Privacy Act, but has not been specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy under an Executive Order or Act of Congress."</p>

<DESC><p><br />Combined Synopsis/Solicitation</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-10-R-DBR013 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<p>Contract line items for this requirement are listed in Attachment II.</p>
<p>Contractor's proposal shall provide a unit price per student on a Firm-Fixed Price basis for each CLIN on Attachment II. The Government will evaluate price proposals and may award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial price proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>Contractor's price proposal shall also include cost per student for ground transportation from nearest commercial airport to contractor's training facility and back. Enter this data on Attachment II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Price will be evaluated to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the sub-totals for the elements in attachment II. Ground transportation to/from nearest airport is not a separate price or direct cost under this contract. Nevertheless, USCG does reimburse its members/employees for this expense and it will be considered in analyzing price proposals. The Government may determine that proposal unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Contractor's proposal shall document whether it is certified as an Educational Institution to provide 3100CG TRANSAS ECDIS training with National Maritime Center (NMC). Refer to the NMC website http://www.uscg.mil/nmc/gmap/findschool.asp <br /><br />Contractor's proposal shall document the ratio of students to simulators in accordance with 5.0 of the PWS (Attachment I).</p>
<p>Contractors shall provide recent past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS.

Relevant is defined as work that is pertinent to the PWS and is of the same quality of service, timeliness or scheduling and similar business relations. To be considered recent, the services must have been performed within the past three years. Contractors shall include three references consisting of : (1) the contract number; (2) the agency or company for which the work was performed; (3) a summary of the work product(s) and similarities with the requirements of this RFP; and (4) the name of the contracting and technical person(s) to be contacted with their address, telephone, email address and facsimile numbers. If there is no past performance information, please provide the following statement in your proposal "No Past Performance information available". Contractors shall forward attachment IV "Past Performance Questionnaire" to each of its references with directions to return the questionnaire directly to the contract specialist Diran Arslanian.</p>
<p>The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the quotations received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>A proposal will be determined technically acceptable if the contractor: (1) is certified, (2) meets the simulator to student ratio, and (3) has no negative past performance information.</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.<br /><br />This is a best value, commercial item acquisition; award may be made for other than lowest price and will be made to the offer or proposing the best value to the Government.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 17 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 19 June 2010. E-mail quotes are acceptable and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200135 in subject line.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 18 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 21 June 2010. E-mail quotes are acceptable and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200136 in subject line.

<p>&nbsp;COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

THERE ARE NO OTHER CHANGES TO THIS SOLICITATION


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NICHD-10-111 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standards are $7.0M.  However, this solicitation is a not a set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure the Professional Services of AlgoTek, Inc to continue to provide technical and scientific advice to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in order to promote and advance the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiative (MOBCI).  The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

The MOBCI Broad area Announcement is aimed at promoting high-risk, high-yield, scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding, rather than focusing on a specific system of solution. Algotek, Inc was first retained as a special expert consultant to the NIAAA in the 2007 at the beginning to provide advice on the development of a revolutionary research initiative on the mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorders. Algotek has the unique capabilities needed for this project as demonstrated by education, training, work experience, success in managing highly competitive, revolutionary research programs w/in the Federal Government.  Algotek have unique familiarity with the current project because of their recent experiences in providing consultation on its formulation and development.  Algotek expertise and credibility in mathematics, neurophysiology and computation science, as well as their demonstrated ability to establish highly effective revolutionary research programs, are essential to the NIAAA in establishing this research program.  Algotek has developed new approaches for evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of novel computational methods and for comparing and integrating the results of heterogeneous research programs. Algotek has the professional standing and experience to attract and integrate world-class researchers normally outside the field of alcohol research, but with potentially valuable insights into the field, to collaborate with alcohol researchers.  Furthermore, Algotek has excellent relations with a number of Federal agencies that will maximize co-funding opportunities for the NIAAA. 

In continuing with our work since 2007 for FY10 Algotek, Inc will be involved in the following activities/tasks: 

	Continue to consult on technical questions and agenda preparation for proposal site visits
	Continue to participate in proposal site visits
	Consulting and participating in MOBCI kick-off meeting
	Consulting and participating in MOBCI quarterly meeting and other meetings, as needed

	Facilitating of transdisciplinary collaborations within and among contractor team
	Develop a plan and format for modeling workshop
	Establish/discuss the overarching technical goals of project and how they will fit into the big picture of understanding MOBCI
	Continue to work with Consortium members on milestones and go/no-g decisions for projects during Year one
	Identify notable progress areas and technical achievements
	Discussion and formulation of desirable model/data/result sharing and use among  Consortium members
	Formulation/development  of initial Wiki site for sharing of data, articles, models and general communication and team building
	Discussion and Assist with Next Steps: Configuration management and SharePoint development
	Travel to Consortium Teams and NIAAA as needed
	Support MOBCI Consortium goal/milestone development and technical assessment
	Support MOBCI technical workshops, Principal Investigator meetings and site visits to Consortium sites
	Facilitate and support inter- and intra-project inter-disciplinary collaborations
	Provide input to NIAAA information systems staff on MOBCI Consortium wiki/collaborative environment for discussions, data sharing, references/papers sharing and possible executable models/algorithm and

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, appliesto this acquisition.9.   The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, will not beused.  The following clause will be used to evaluate proposals.M-307  EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD (BEST VALUE)(a) The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to thatresponsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determinedtoprovide the "best value" to the Government.  Such offer may not necessarily bethe proposal offering the lowest cost or receiving the highest technical rating.(b) Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors listed below.It should be noted that cost is not a numerically weighted factor.  Althoughtechnical factors are significantly more important than cost, cost is animportantfactor and should be considered when preparing responsive proposals. Theimportance of cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree ofequality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.Whenthe offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal interms of technical capability, or when cost is so significantly high as todiminishthe value of the technical superiority to the government, cost may become thedetermining factor for award.  In summary, cost/technical trade-offs will bemade, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governedonly by the tests of rationality and consistency with the establishedevaluationfactors.Factor 1 and Factor 2 are of equal importance and are more importantindividually than Factor 3.Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS.10.  Offerors shall include in their proposal a completed copy of the provisionat 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items,with its offer.  A copy of 52.212-3 is included as Attachment 2 to thissolicitation.11.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- CommercialItems, applies to this acquisition and is included in this solicitation..12. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required ToImplement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to thisacquisition.  Additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are included as anattachment to this solicitation.13.  Additional Information:The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) may be accessed at:http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.Offerors shall submit a price for each CLIN in paragraph  5 above based on thenine milestones described in paragraph 7 above.L-324  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSALS(a) The technical proposal shall cover your understanding of the work and yourmethod to attain contract objectives.  The technical approach shall enabletechnical personnel to make a thorough evaluation and a determination as towhether the product proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of thegovernment.  The technical proposal shall be specific, detailed and completeand fully demonstrate that the prospective offeror has a thoroughunderstanding of the government's requirements.  Statements that theprospective offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications,statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, and phrases suchas "standard procedures will be employed" or "well known techniques will beused," etc., will be considered insufficient.(b) Specifically, the following information should be included in yourtechnicalproposal:Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE:The offeror shall provide  3  descriptions of relevant projects worked on inthepast 10 years that are of similar structural size and also included sea towing.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE:The offeror shall provide 3 contact references for projects worked on in thepast10 years.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS:The offeror shall submit a project plan, similar to a business plan, detailingtheprocess either planned or in place for the project that will confirm allcriticalrequirements and specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) will bemet.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p>This is a best value, commercial item acquisition; award may be made for other than lowest price and will be made to the offer or proposing the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 07 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 09 June 2010. E-mail quotes are acceptable and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200131 in subject line.

<DESC>Collaborative Website Requirement
VA798-10-RQ-0106

A.	 This requirement has not been extended.  The due date for responses remains May 27, 2010 at 3:00 PM EDT.  No additional questions will be accepted after issuance of this amendment.

B.	Questions and Answers

1.	The comprehensive web based Program management plan with dashboard/metrics needs to be implemented three weeks from award.  Can this be a web based solution, if so is there a preference as to where it will be hosted?

Government Response:  The design calls for VA to host the website with content provided by the contractor.

2.	If the Program Management plan is provided in an online format, does it need to be 508 compliant?

Government Response:  Yes.

3.	Will the collaborative website be hosted at the VA facility or Vendor Site?

Government Response:  See response to Question 1.

4.	Will the vendor be responsible for the purchase of software licenses hardware?

Government Response:     This has not been determined at this time, but should this prove to be the most efficient way of doing business, the appropriate budgetary adjustments will be made.  

5.	Does any hardware to support this already exist? If so, where are the servers located? Will there be a vendor day to tour the VA facility hardware?

Government Response:  Yes. A pre-contractual vendor day activity is not planned.  
 
6.	Does the VA own any enterprise licenses for COTS collaboration tools that can be used for this effort?

Government Response:     Not to the best of our knowledge.

7.	Are there any service level support requirements related to this program initiative?

Government Response:    Any other requirements that may be related do not affect the achievement of this program.

8.	Can some of the non-customer facing development work and or hosting be performed at a nearby contractor facility?

Government Response:     Yes

9.	Do all resources working on the project need to be US Citizens?

Government Response:  Contractor employees working on this project must meet the Security requirements stated in VAAR 852.273-75 which is included in the posted notice.  In addition, those employees must read, write, speak, and understand the English language fluently and maintain good communication skills.

10.	Will there be an oral presentation phase to the evaluation process?

Government Response:   No. 

11.	Will the contractor be responsible cost hardware/software licensing needed to develop the solution?

Government Response:     This has not been determined at this time, but should this prove to be the most efficient way of doing business, the appropriate budgetary adjustments will be made.  

12.	Is there a preferred methodology for this effort e.g. Rational Unified Process?

Government Response:   No. 

13.	Are there any specific COTS products that are envisioned to be part of the SEI collaborative portal?

Government Response:    No.

14.	Please elaborate on required functionality at each milestones related pertaining to the collaborative website timeline:

o   Functionality of the collaborative website to be implemented not later than four months after project initiation? 
o   Stage I Interactive website design and functionality at 6 months 
o   Stage II at 8 months
Government Response:  Proposal are expected to determine the levels of functionality based on a realistic projection of deliverables based on the timeline provided.   

15.	As the VA plans to host the website will the VA provide server hardware from its own infrastructure, or is the contractor expected to quote hardware? 

Government Response:  This has not been determined at this time, but should this prove to be the most efficient way of doing business, the appropriate budgetary adjustments will be made.  




16.	The solicitation states that the collaborative website will have content managed and uploaded by the contractor. However as a collaboration tool including blogs and wikis, we would expect (as in corporate settings) that end users (SES) would contribute and collaborate on content. Can the government clarify what kind of content the contractor is responsible for - e.g. is it "best practices for using a collaboration framework and tools?"

Government Response: Much of the content will be determined based on the assessment. Government expects the content to go well beyond information regarding best practices for using a collaboration framework; instead it expects that the content and methods used to generate online collaboration will result in a best practice for government.  

The contractor will be responsible for implementing collaborative management tools for engaging the members of the Senior Executive Service such as a central, interactive repository of knowledge that can serve as an ongoing resource for current and future SES members better doing their jobs and assisting with VA transformation efforts.   This will include but is not be limited to access to online educational resources and information for members of the VA Senior Executive Service.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Refrigerated Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.  A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. 1525

<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements below.
<p>NMFS desires to contract for an occupied submersible and support vessel in waters off southern California. The submersible will be used to make visual observations and quantitatively survey demersal fishes, coral/sponge assemblages, and associated habitats on rocky offshore banks at depths of 80-350 m. There are two main objectives of this work: (1) to quantify habitat-specific abundance, size composition, and condition of corals and conduct surveys of fish associations with corals at various times of day and evening to quantify the function of corals as habitat for fishes on offshore rocky banks in the southern California Bight; and (2) to quantify species and size composition of demersal fishes and estimate habitat-specific abundance on an offshore rocky bank in the southern California Bight. A minimum of 6 dive-days (plus additional days to transit, and mobilize and demobilize scientists and equipment) will be required during September-October 2010, and a minimum of 8 dive-days (plus additional days to transit, and mobilize and demobilize scientists and equipment) will be required during September-October 2011.</p>
<p>Submersible Requirements:<br /><br />Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research. The total submersible system shall consist of an occupied submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, accurate tracking system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have the capability of carrying aboard at least one (1) NFMS Observer and one (1) Contractor provided pilot, and shall have viewing ports accessible to the observer during all portions of the dive. Contractor shall provide at least two (2) fully qualified pilots for the purpose of alternating dive participation, and one support crew member to assist with deck operations, and navigation, tracking, and communication with submersible (for a total of at least 3 submersible personnel).</p>
<p>The submersible shall be capable of regularly operating to a depth of 360 m sea water and must be able to operate in contact with the seafloor over rugged substrate that includes boulders, pinnacles and rockwalls. The submersible shall be certified American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), or recognized equivalent, to this depth, with appropriate documentation of inspection and construction.</p>
<p>The submersible and support crew shall be capable of providing 6-8 hours of submergence during a normal operating day, consisting of multiple dives. The submersible shall be highly maneuverable and capable of performing multiple dives per day while steaming at a minimum speed of 2 km/hour with external lights on and frequent use of external strobes. The submersible shall have a means to deploy and retrieve sampling gear and biological specimens.</p>
<p>Exterior lighting and illumination capable of providing sufficient light for video imaging of objects at a distance of at least 20 ft from the submersible at maximum operating depths is required. A through-hull electrical connection to the exterior strobes shall be provided for use with internal hand-held cameras. An external, high resolution color video camera capable of being mounted on the front or the side of the submersible in such a way as to generate high quality video record of transects, along the sea floor, with viewing angle adjustable from horizontal to vertical is required. The video system shall include an internal monitor, digital recording deck, and have datalogger capability (PISCES design or similar) encoded with synchronous data on time, date, and depth. The video system will include externally mounted multiple lasers for measuration purposes. In addition, the submersible will be outfitted with a recently calibrated CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) and altimeter sensor that are linked to an operational data logging system. All CTD and navigation data will be provided to chief scientist each evening as digital ASCII-format files.</p>
<p>The submersible shall be capable of carrying and using a Doppler velocity log and Ring Laser Gyro that will enable the determination of the exact distance traveled by the submersible. This equipment will be installed by submersible personnel in a manner that does not interfere with the conduct of fish surveys.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have communication equipment (i.e., underwater submersible to support vessel-surface communication). Minimum range for such equipment (underwater model) shall be one-half mile. During surface operations, the submersible must have a means for visual contact (functional strobe and locating beacon as a minimum). The submersible's Contractor shall have an operations procedure manual including emergency procedures and safety precautions. All observers/scientists will be briefed on these safety procedures and precautions prior to diving. Submersible supplies should include air/regulator for pilot and scientist; insulated emergency suits for prolonged submergence. The life support system (02 + C02 scrubber) systems of the submersible must be capable of supporting submersible occupants for at least 72 hours at an ambient temperature range of one (1) to twelve (12) degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have a functional acoustic tracking beacon for acquisition of depth/range from the support ship (e.g., Trackpoint II type and Winfrog, or equivalent). The operator of this equipment will need to precisely track the submersible transects, and provide a digital ASCII-formatted file of navigational data synchronized with time for each transect. Precision of these navigational data is critical to the success of our project.</p>
<p>Support Vessel Requirements:</p>
<p>1. The support vessel shall be of sufficient size, minimum length of 100 ft overall, to safely launch and recover the submersible and special oceanographic equipment during at least sea state five (5) conditions in the operating area. Sea state five (5) is herein defined as average wave (swell and local seas) heights of six (6) feet and/or wind velocities of 21 knots. The support vessel shall meet the requirements of NOAAs National Undersea Research Program (NURP) for certification and safety inspection.<br />2. The support vessel shall be highly responsive for precise positioning and submersible retrieval, i.e., ideally with bow thruster and/or two-engine main propulsion system to maximize maneuverability.<br />3. The support vessel shall be available to mobilize on the dates specified for this project.<br />4. Bridge to deck communication (VHF or hardwire) and unobstructed view of the submersible is required for launch/retrieval operations. An aft control center would be optimal.<br />5. The support vessel shall have a complete hydraulic-powered launch and retrieval system with two times (2X) manned submersible weight capacity for precisely maneuvering the submersible from the deck cradle into and out of the water in the sea conditions defined. Documentation of a recent static lift test must be provided. All submersible-handling equipment shall meet the NOAA NURP certification requirements.<br />6. The support vessel shall provide a minimum of 50 kW of 120 volt AC electrical power within 80 ft of deck-mounted submersible operations center. Three-phase 220 volt power is desirable.<br />7. The support vessel shall be capable of remaining at sea for at least ten (10) days without resupplying and capable of cruising at least nine (9) knots to minimize transit time between stations. The required work-day duration will be 12 hours of submersible support dive time and 24-hour crew support duration to permit surface-oriented oceanographic research and/or 24-hour transiting to the next dive station.<br />8. The total launch-and-recovery system shall not require scientific personnel to participate in the at-sea operations of the submersible handling of the launch and recovery system.<br />9. Berthing (including clean, dry bunks, bedding, linen, blankets and towels), food, fresh water, survival suits, etc. for a scientific crew of at least eight (8) persons shall be provided by the support vessel in addition to the staffed submersible crew (3 persons). Food provided shall be of high quality, sufficient quantity, and well prepared.<br />10.

The support vessel shall provide laboratory space for the scientific personnel, exclusive of space for the submersible crew (provided in their own work van), including at least a suitable desk or dry counter work space of about 40 sq ft for data preparation and video viewing and post-dive tape summary.<br />12. The support vessel shall provide at least 10 cu ft freezer storage exclusive of space required for ship's use, plus refrigeration space (32-40 degrees F) for short-term specimen storage, and at least 500 cu ft of readily accessible, dry, clean storage space for equipment.<br />13. The support vessel shall be equipped with fully operating primary and back-up units for standard ship's navigation (including radar and differential Global Positioning System (dGPS)) for at-sea operations.<br />14. The support vessel shall have a high resolution recording fathometer (minimum accuracy of plus or minus 1 m in 305 m of water) capable of rounding to at least 500 m.<br />15. The support vessel shall have both primary and back-up SSB and VHF units for standard ship-to-shore communications capability, including access to the marine operator at distances from shore required by the operating areas. Cellular communications equipment is desirable. Hand-held radios shall be provided for all shore parties and skiff operators.<br />16. Modest on-board machine shop capabilities are required to accommodate sampling apparatus modification as necessary. In addition, ship/sub crew shall be qualified to perform dive/sampling systems troubleshooting (electronic, mechanical, photographic tasks).<br />17. The support ship will carry at least one suitable seaworthy skiff (e.g., 18 ft inflatable with 25 hp outboard), which may be launched/retried as a dive tender and for transportation to shore at remote locations. There must also be at least one spare outboard motor onboard in good working condition.<br />18. The support ship will provide a safe means of boarding and deboarding personnel and equipment.<br />19. The crew will consist of a captain, first mate, engineer, cook, and deck hand.<br />20. All safety equipment on the support vessel shall be functional.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

Discuss ideas for the SOW and other requirements documents, and RFP in general, to allow for a better proposal; <BR>2. Identify specific requirement omissions from the SOW and other requirements documents that would better articulate and define IR/DRTS in concept and detail; <BR>3. Identify potential issues in the Draft SOW and other requirements documents that may unnecessarily constrain contractors' latitude in approach to the IR/DRTS requirements.<BR><BR>The IR/DRTS team anticipates that these meetings will not exceed 1 hours in length at our facility, and will be held 24 through 26 August 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY-"In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub.L 111-5 and Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 5.704, The Government posts this notice of intent to issue a task order under an established IDIQ Contract with Humanitas, Inc., 1100 Wayne Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20910."
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVILABLE UNDER CONTRACT # HHSH250200976001I, Administrative, Technical and Logistical Support Services to HRSA's Office of Federal Assistance Management, Division of Independent Review, to plan, direct and execute the independent review of applications for HRSA grants and cooperative agreements for web-assisted Teleconference Meetings and Field Reviews.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Review entitled "(BHPr) Comprehensive Geriatric ARRA Education Program Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals." These services include pre-review, review and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>Add the Following to Description:<br />The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a Cost Reimbursement Task Order to Humanitas, Inc., under the IDIQ Contract No. HHSH250200976001I, in the amount of $20,759.51. The period of performance is for three and one half (3.5) months from the effective date of award.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Comprehensive Geriatric ARRA Education Program Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals." These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a Cost Reimbursement Task Order to Humanitas, Inc., under the IDIQ Contract No. HHSH250200976001I, in the amount of $10,722.04. The period of performance is for three (3) months from the effective date of award.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals (EETHP) - Training in Primary Medicine and Dentistry Physician Assistant Training." These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>

<DESC>Title - RECOVERY - ARRA Oracle &reg; GRC Consulting Services
<p>RECOVERY ACT ACTION</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) BUSINESS SYSTEMS OFFICE (NBS), OFFICE OF THE DIRECOTER (0D)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 5.7 Publicizing Requirements Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act this is a notification of a modification to an existing, competively awarded fixed priced delivery order using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding. The contract is for administrative, technical and logistical support and was competed and awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded delivery order number HHSN-276-2009-00572U to Oracle USA, Inc. (DUNS No. 005536698) on 9/30/2009. This initiative, approved by the NIH Management Budget and Work Group (MBWG) and the Director, NIH provides improvements to the NIH enterprise resource program (ERP) infrastructure to support the implementation of the ARRA, including activities to improve accountability, transparency and reporting, and mitigating the risk of fraud, waste and abuse, of all federal funds including ARRA funds. This initiative strengthens ERP access and transaction controls, and will provide the NIH with and enterprise-wide risk management tool to manage both financial and programmatic risks. The contractor provides resources to assist in the implementation of the Oracle Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) application suite of software, to include testing, configuration, documentation and training. The contractor also provides resources in quantities and timelines in accordance with, and as notified by, the current ordering processes of the Project Officer to meet agency demands for surge support.</p>
<p>This notification is to acknowledge the modification to the task order mentioned above through the issuance of task order no. HHSN-276-2010-00293U. The proposed modification is for implementation services identified during scoping sessions. This change will cost $190,991.03 and the details are provided below:</p>
<p>&bull; The requested modification is to add additional ARRA funds to the existing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) control previously competed under the ARRA procurement requirements. <br />&bull; Additional implementation services as defined during the scoping sessions.<br />&bull; Additional Technical Workshops and a workshop to evaluate CCG's capability to integrate with the Siteminder Secure Proxy Server and Single Sign-On to ensure NIH is compliant with IT Security Standards.<br />&bull; Other critical related services identified during scoping sessions are needed.</p>
<p>The new task order (HHSN-276-2010-00293U) is for the acquisition of GRC Controls Suite application provided by ORACLE USA, Inc. During the solicitation and award phase of this procurement, NBS was not aware of the need for the additional implementation services, technical workshops and other critical related services. Also, during the scoping session for this task order it was determined that a significant number of extra requirements that were not initially proposed but are needed to completed the project would be provided. Prior to award, this procurement was competed through GSA Schedule 70 SIN 132-51 amongst two other vendors, Price Waterhouse Coopers, LLP and Deloitte Consulting, LLP. Since the items requested by the program are needed for the contractor to effectively complete the work under the subject order, and the additional installation of tools for the GRC application are required for complete up-to-date functionality, a Change-Order will be issued to Oracle USA, Inc. for the required services in accordance with FAR 52-243-1. In accordance with the ARRA guidance, the modification to this award is being publically posted on FedBiz Ops for notification purposes.</p>
<p>The modification required the first option year to be exercised early. The contractor has an internal financial holdback on the contract value of fixed price projects. That holdback is not recognized as revenue until the completion of the contract. The option years on this contract present a unique challenge for the contractor, which causes them the inability to financially close out the base project until four years from now after the optional work under the original task order. Therefore, the contractor would not be able recognize the financial holdback of the contract value as revenue until the year 2014. This is a revenue recognition problem and also violates the principle of recognizing the revenue when it was earned for the contractor. For this reason, the contracting officer and Branch Chief, Sally Boakye, have agreed to the contractor's request of providing a new task order for the ARRA services under Option Year One. There is no new work associated with this modification.</p>
<p><br />This notice is for information purposes only. This is not a RFQ nor is a RFQ available.<br />If you have any questions please contact Raymond Hawkins at hawkinsra@mail.nih.gov</p>

The four (4) bid proposals were evaluated by the panel members with two vendors being technical acceptable and capable of providing the required services.</p>
<p>The Contracting Office determined that Alpha Construction and Engineering Corporation should be selected for award based on the overall technical superiority rating received for their proposal. <br />Based on all of the above it is in the best interest of the Government to modify the current contract with Alpha Construction and Engineering Corporation for the additional services in lieu of initiating a new procurement for the same services.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0001.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Navy have identified more than 400 underwater sites that are potentially contaminated with munitions and most are in shallow water posing a threat to human safety and the environment.  Similar to dry land UXO, successful and economical remediation requires a well-coordinated combination of sensor technologies, and effective classification algorithms to detect the munitions but with minimal false alarm rate.

<DESC>Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  North Branch, VA Puget Sound Healthcare System , 9600 Veterans Drive, Tacoma, WA  98493

2.	Description of Action:  This is a justification for other than full and open competition for the procurement of Service Agreement to maintain and service two BV Pulsera C-Arms (also known as fluoroscopes or portable X-ray machines) for the Research and Development Office for the Department of Veterans Affairs VA Puget Sound Healthcare System (VAPSHCS).  This is a sole source per FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  The use of a particular vendor is required to service the robotic C-Arms that were acquired under R&D contract SPM200-02-D-8321 ensuring consistency in research studies.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:   VAPSHCS has a requirement for service and maintenance of two BV Pulsera C-Arms.  The RR&D Center of Excellence for Limb Loss Prevention and Prosthetic Engineering has recently purchased two BV Pulsera C-arms (i.e., fluoroscopes or portable X-ray machines).  The RR&D Department is currently in the process of taking the C-arms apart and constructing a custom designed biplane fluoroscope.  They will be one of about five laboratories in the country with the ability to use a biplane fluoroscope to study the internal motion of bones.  The current warrantee on the C-arms expires in May of 2010.  This service agreement will allow us to have Philips Medical Systems provide service and routine maintenance to the C-arms.   The vendor is required to provide customer services on the robotic C-Arms located at 1660 South Columbian Way, Bldg 13, Room 105, Seattle, WA 98108.  The equipment quality performance assurance service as scheduled by Philips will include a general system inspection and review of system operation, calibrating the system as necessary, system lubrication and filter replacement or cleaning, completing minor operational and reliability field engineering change notices or updates and other remedial maintenance of a non-emergency nature. Philips will provide such planned maintenance during the Service Coverage hours at a time that is mutually agreed upon.  The estimated cost for these services is $42,720.00 for a period of performance of 14 May 2010 through 30 April 2014.

4.	Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  Philips Medical Systems is the only contractor providing this technology with the specifications needed.  In addition, Philips Medical Systems is working with the RR&D Center to modify the two C-arms to develop the biplane system.
6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  In the future, the contracting specialist will conduct market research for any new vendors that offer these services.  

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: The anticipated price to the Government is $42,346.  The base year will cost $10,306.78 (~$890 per month).  Each of three option years will be at the same cost per month.  This is a unique piece of equipment that has been modified to meet our specifications.  As per past service contracts for similar equipment from other companies (e.g., MTS), this has been determined fair and reasonable. 

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was performed. 

9.	Other Considerations:  Unique source  vendor is sole manufacturer and distributor of product purchased that will be in need of service.  There are no other authorized vendors who can service this equipment made with the technology and the specifications for our needs.  See attached sole source.

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None.

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Due to the unique nature of service required this sole source is necessary.  However, prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors can offer these services.					
12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bona fide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 

Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
