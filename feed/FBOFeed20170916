<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with LKC Technologies Incorporated to purchase a UTAS Visual Electrodiagnostic System (VES) equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld stimulator to support the Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) and the Signal Transduction Laboratory (STL). This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" and has a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Branches &amp; Laboratories at NIEHS fall under the Intramural Research and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Divisions. The CMB ensures the judicious and humane use of rodents for biomedical research that benefits human and animal health and the overall goal of the STL is to define the mechanisms that cells, tissues and organisms use to respond to physiological and environmental stimuli. The CMB and STL need a VES with testing capabilities and protocols that can perform beyond the capabilities of an Electroretinogram (ERG) (i.e. more than retinal function evaluation in mice). The system will be used to perform electrodiagnostic evaluations of visual functions in mice. In addition, the VES will help provide specific data about the location and underlying causative factors of abnormalities that routine diagnostic tests cannot differentiate. The UTAS VES equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld Stimulator offers a unique set of testing capabilities and protocols (i.e. comprises several technologies which record electrical potentials from the surface of the eyes to provide objective indications of the function of various parts of the visual system) that are not available on any other commercially available system. The UTAS VES equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld stimulator offers the capabilities and features described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within three (3) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within three (3) days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to LKC Technologies Incorporated. There is no solicitation package available. The Contracting Officer for this requirement is Ms. Onyenauch&eacute; Washington. All questions or concerns relating to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail to uche.washington@nih.gov</p>

SPECIFIED REQUIREMENT: Network Contracting Office 7, Charleston, SC is seeking sources for a potential contractor to perform the following type of service: 
STATEMENT OF WORK

TITLE OF PROJECT:  Annual Software Maintenance Service for TargetVision Equipment 

SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to provide full software support for all TargetVision system equipment in use at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center (RHJVAMC) at 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC, 29401, and at RHJVAMC s associated Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).  Full software support is defined as such services which involves upgrading of software and checking the correct functioning of these devices to ensure the fault-free operation.  This software maintenance work shall be performed via vendor remote log-in, unless the difficulties are such that on-site maintenance and/or repair work from Contractor personnel is required.  

BACKGROUND: The devices listed below (EQUIPMENT TO BE SERVICED) require regular maintenance and timely software upgrades as they become available. To enhance patient experience, maintenance must be completed immediately.  Excessive downtime will negatively impact the patient experience while they are waiting for care. Also, due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software, only a vendor-certified technician should perform the maintenance.
 
PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The contractor shall complete the work required under this SOW during the following time periods.  The annual period of performance for the base year (and thus all subsequent option years) shall begin October 1, 2017, or upon the date this contract is awarded.       

TYPE OF CONTRACT: Firm-Fixed-Price

SCOPE:  The Contractor shall be fully responsible and accountable for software maintenance of all listed equipment beginning on the date specified in the Notice to Proceed.  These specifications are a statement of the minimum level services that are to be provided. They are not intended to be, nor shall they be construed as, limiting specifications or requirements. At a minimum, for the covered units the contractor shall perform software support every year and to take all measures which would be taken by a prudent manufacturer to maximize the life expectancy and minimize downtime of related systems and ensure safe and reliable operation. 

All covered devices shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, the best practices of the industry, and applicable codes, standards, and regulations. If a conflict arises between these standards, the most stringent shall prevail. 

The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel with an approved vendor clearance to perform maintenance on the equipment in use throughout the RHJVAMC and at associated Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).  Software maintenance shall include vendor remote log-in to the TargetVision system if necessary to restore optimum operation or modify capabilities of the system. 

All scheduled work that requires a TargetVision unit to be taken out of service shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR) or designee and the contractor shall report to the COR or designee the status of equipment or systems not operating by the close of each workday.  The contractor shall be responsible for the installation of signs as related to equipment and/or systems as deemed necessary by the COR or designee. In the event, any device is identified as defective and requires repair, a  defective  sign must be placed on each unit until unit has been repaired or the error has been rectified.  

The Contractor shall maintain the machinery spaces, shops, and storage areas in a clean and orderly manner. When work is performed in these areas, the Contractor's personnel shall clean up all debris and leave the area in a presentable condition. The Contractor must obtain the approval of the COR or designee before storing anything in equipment spaces. Operating supplies such as lubricants, rags, cleaners, etc., shall be properly secured in containers approved by the COR or designee. Storage shall not negatively impact the means of egress, fire protection systems, and emergency lighting; nor, shall it significantly increase the amount of combustible material in the equipment space. Safety requirements shall be maintained as required by NFPA, the National Electrical Code and the manufacturer s recommendations.

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Education intends to award sole source firm fixed price purchase order to the OCLC, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It has been determined that the OCLC, is the only nonprofit provider of a hosted proxy server highly trusted for our government system. There are many proxy servers available some are even free through Open Source with questionable securities.  There other companies which provide a proxy service for profit. The OCLC, Online Computer Library Center (formerly the Ohio College Library Center) has been a trusted library technology provider since its beginning in 1967.  The OCLC is continually developing technology to provide further access to information while reducing information costs. The proxy service authenticates users to our subscription databases which require authorized access on our federal system. This provides current instructors and student access to the university libraryâ€™s e-content while off campus or utilizing their private routers on campus.  The OCLCâ€™s EZProxy is the industry standard for libraries, services utilizes sign-in credentials already established such as the studentâ€™s LDAP, instructional educational platforms (Blackboard), or their library card to authenticate their access to the Bureau of Indian Educationâ€™s government online system.  When the library card is utilized, we remain in control to grant the privileges each semester is re-enrolled or is active with local internships or research with our neighboring university.  The OCLC, Online Computer Library Center, is the authority figure in worldwide metadata for libraries. The OCLC hosts the largest worldwide online public access catalog, WorldCat, connecting 16,131 libraries in 120 countries including Haskell Indian Nations University.  The MARC records provided by the OCLCâ€™s Cataloging and Metadata Service is unmatched providing more current and accurate library material records than our nationâ€™s Library of Congress. This saves much time and effort than creating original cataloging records or painstakingly importing them from various systems.    The purpose of this procurement is to award based on a sole source requirement, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  This notice is not a request for competitive quotations.  A solicitation will not be available for this requirement.  The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only.  However, any information received within five business days after the posting date of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Information may be sent to Janice Begay, Purchasing Agent at janice.begay@bie.edu. A determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Questions may be directed via the above email.

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p><br />&emsp;<br />Requirements</p>
<p>This order is to acquire an inert atmosphere glovebox, to provide a controlled environment for storage of sensitive chemicals and to set up sensitive chemical reactions.  The criteria for the product are: <br />1.	Gas purification system<br />2.	Gas purification system for closed cycle circulation of gloveboxes<br />3.	Removal: oxygen and moisture, &lt;1 ppm (referring to gloveboxes with max. leak rate O2 = 0.05 Vol%/h, according to ISO 10648-2)<br />4.	Maximum effective purifying volume: 2 m&sup3;<br />5.	Filter: 1-filter column gas purifier<br />6.	Capacity blower: max. 20 m&sup3;/h<br />7.	Control (PLC) with operation panel<br />8.	Regeneration program: automatic, PLC-controlled<br />9.

<p>The mission of the PET Radiopharmaceutical Science Section (PRSS) is to develop new PET radioligands and develop radiolabeling methods.  In our research, we consistently synthesize small molecule compounds.  This requires a variety of high precision instruments, including an inert atmosphere glovebox.  This order is to order a new glovebox that will be used to store air-sensitive chemicals and set up sensitive chemical reactions. The glove box will be filled with nitrogen, instead of air and will be used to synthesize small molecule compounds for organic chemistry, as well as for PET radiochemistry.  The instrument will be used heavily by 10 group members.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Justice (DOJ), Facilities and Administrative Services Staff, intends to contract for electricity services on a sole source basis with Two Con LLC (Stonebridge Carras (Stonebridge)), 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Bethesda MD, the property manager of the building located at 145 N Street NE, Washington D.C., in which DOJ is the primary tenant. The property manager is responsible for paying for the cost of electricity utilized in this building and passing these costs on to the DOJ through lease payments. The DOJ has installed "above standard" retail loop and Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units in this building. Each unit requires a separate electrical meter. The contract action will be for the lessor to supply the electricity needed to operate the retail loop and CRAC units. The electricity supplied to the equipment is tied into the building's overall electrical system. It is the Government's belief that Stonebridge is the only vendor capable of providing electricity required to operate the government furnished equipment that is installed in this building. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. No written solicitation will be issued. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries shall be received no later than September 20, 2017, 4:30 pm EST. No telephonic responses will be accepted on this action.

As used in this clause-&shy;<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a <br />Page 8 of 48 <br />cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br />(b) <br />If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>

<p>(2) <br />Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(3)<br />For long-term contracts-&shy;</p>
<p>(i) <br />Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) <br />Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) <br />The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f)<br />If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) <br />If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties. <br />Page 17 of 48 <br />(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use. <br />-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein. <br />-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean Depuy Synthes Sales, Inc. dba Depuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction. <br />-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA. <br />-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center. <br />-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD). <br />-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007). <br />-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007). <br />-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR <br />164.402. <br />-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules. <br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance. <br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate <br />(a) <br />The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.</p>
<p>(b) <br />The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement.</p>
<p>(c) <br />The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.</p>
<p>(d) <br />In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.</p>
<p>(e) <br />The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.</p>
<p>(f) <br />The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.</p>
<p>(g) <br />The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.</p>
<p>(h) <br />To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and</p>
<p>(i) <br />The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p><br />II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate <br />(a) <br />The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.</p>
<p>(b) <br />The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(c) <br />The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.</p>
<p>(d) <br />Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>(e) <br />Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.</p>
<p>(f) <br />Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.</p>
<p><br />Page 19 of 48 <br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions <br />(a) <br />The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(b) <br />The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>(c) <br />The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p><br />IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity <br />The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA. <br />V. Breach Response <br />(a) In general. <br />In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances. <br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach. <br />This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach. <br />(b) Government Reporting Provisions <br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT)&nbsp;-the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate. <br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us&shy;cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e&shy;mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us&shy;cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the&nbsp;-Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. <br />Page 21 of 48 <br />Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US-CERT office. <br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation. <br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances. <br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed. <br />(c) Individual Notification Provisions <br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted. <br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies <br />Page 22 of 48 <br />of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following: <br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached. <br />-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred. <br />-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. <br />-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information. <br />Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address. <br />If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval. <br />The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing. <br />Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds <br />Page 23 of 48 <br />that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA. <br />VI. Termination <br />(a) <br />Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) <br />Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) <br />If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.</p>
<p>(2) <br />If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.</p>
<p>(3) <br />If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.</p>
<p><br />VII. Miscellaneous <br />(a) <br />Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) <br />Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p><br />(End of HCAA Local Clause 5001) <br />LEIE <br />Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs (October 2015) Page 24 of 48 <br />1. <br />The Contractor shall not employ or contract with any individual or entity (hereinafter collectively referred to as "person") to provide items or services that will be included in invoices submitted to the Government under this contract if such person is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) or the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List. The Government is legally prohibited from paying for provision of items or services by such persons. The prohibition extends to services beyond direct patient care, such as services of persons in executive or leadership roles and administrative and management services, whether or not such services are billed separately. The LEIE may be found at http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions.asp, and the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider list at http://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Access-Cost-Quality-and-Safety/Quality-And-Safety-of&shy;Healthcare/Program-Integrity/Sanctioned-Providers.

<p>2. <br />Prior to start of contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists to determine whether the name of any person the Contractor employs or contracts with to provide services or items for which payment may be made under this contract appears on the Lists, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the Contractor has queried the Lists and no such names appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>3. <br />During performance of the contract, and prior to persons other than those whose names were queried in accordance with paragraph 2, above, (hereinafter "new persons") providing services or items under the contract, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists as in paragraph 2, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the names of such new persons do not appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>4.<br />The Contractor is advised that during performance of the contract, MTF personnel will perform a recurrent recheck of the names of contractor personnel working in the MTF against the Lists, as specified in OTSG/MEDCOM Policy Memo 15-037. The Government will notify the Contractor in the event any contractor personnel working in the MTF appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>5. <br />Should any person providing items or services under the contract appear on either of the Lists at any time during contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) in cases where the Contractor identified the person, notify the Contracting Officer, and (b) promptly remove that person from the contract.</p>
<p>6. <br />Violation of any aspect of the above paragraphs shall be considered a material breach of the contract and may result in termination of the contract.</p>
<p>7. <br />The Contractor is further advised that, in accordance with Civil Monetary Penalties Law [CMP] (codified at 42 USC &sect; 1320a-7a):</p>
<p><br />a. <br />There are steep civil monetary penalties associated with billing the Government for providing items or services by a person on either of the Lists, and with failing to return to the Government any overpayments received for provision of such items or services.</p>
<p>b. <br />Billing under the contract for provision of items or services by a person on either List may also result in exclusion of the person that employs or contracts with such person.</p>

<p>(2)<br />[ ___ ] Have, [ ___ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i)<br />Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A)<br />The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B)<br />The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii)<br />Examples.</p>
<p>(A)<br />The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>Page 41 of 48</p>
<p>(B)<br />The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C)<br />The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D)<br />The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
