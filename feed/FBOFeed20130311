<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) on behalf of the U.S. Army  <br> Program Manager Close Combat systems (PM CCS) is conducting a Market Survey to  <br> identify potential sources for the manufacture, inspection, testing, and delivery  <br> of the family of Shoulder-Launch Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) Rounds:  <br>  <br>    <br> 1)	DODIC HX05, Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Dual-Purpose (HEDP) MK3 Mod 0,  <br> NSN: 1340-01-158-0577 <br>   <br> 2)	DODIC HX06, Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Anti-Armor (HEAA) MK6 Mod 0,  <br> NSN: 1340-01-227-8870 <br>  <br> 3)	DODIC HX07, Rocket, 83mm, Common Practice (CP), MK 7 Mod 0,  <br> NSN: 1340-01-227-8871 <br>  <br> 4)	DODIC HA34, Rocket, 83mm, Novel Explosive (NE) MK 80 Mod 0, <br> NSN: 1340-01-503-0809 <br>  <br> The Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) System is a direct fire,  <br> infantry assault and armored vehicle weapon used to destroy fortified bunkers and  <br> urban structures. The SMAW System is comprised of a reusable launcher, sight,  <br> spotting rifle, and a family of four rounds. The four rounds come packaged one to  <br> a disposable encasement, which comprises the rear half of the launch tube and is  <br> packaged with a magazine of ammunition for the spotting rifle. <br>  <br>  <br> Each round is described below: <br>  <br> 1.	The Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Dual-Purpose (HEDP) MK3 Mod 0 is used  <br> against bunkers, urban structures and light armor. It has a range from 17m to  <br> 500m. The Dual Mode warhead is loaded with 2.3 pounds of aluminized Composition  <br> A-3 explosive. It automatically senses the target type and selects the mode  <br> accordingly. Against hard targets (e.g. light armor, concrete, brick, etc.) the  <br> warhead functions immediately upon crushing, allowing a good coupling of energy  <br> into the target. Soft targets (e.g. sand bag covered bunkers) cause the warhead  <br> to function in the delay mode. This delay allows the warhead to penetrate and  <br> increases the heaving capability of the warhead. The spotting cartridge clip is  <br> recessed into the foam spacer used to fill the space between end cap and the front  <br> of the warhead. <br>  <br> 2.	The Rocket, 83mm, High Explosive Anti-Armor (HEAA) MK6 Mod 0 consists of a  <br> unitary shaped charge designed to go against armor. It has a range from 17m to  <br> 500m (250 m with a moving target). The warhead has a trumpet liner and Octol for  <br> the explosive fill. It uses a probe mounted crush switch to increase penetration  <br> by increasing stand-off. Due to the greater length of the round, the spotting  <br> cartridge clip stored in cavity molded into the outside of the end cap. <br>  <br> 3.	The Rocket, 83mm, Common Practice (CP), MK 7 Mod 0 is used for training and <br>  simulates both the DM and HEAA rounds. It consists of an INERT warhead mounted to <br>  the same rocket motor. The plastic warhead contains a marking powder to clearly  <br> show point of impact during training. It is fired from the same encasement as the <br>  tactical rounds and contains ballistically matched spotting rounds. <br>  <br> 4.	The Rocket, 83mm, Novel Explosive (NE) MK 80 Mod 0 was developed to provide <br>  enhanced blast capability against caves and urban structures. It has a range from <br>  50m to 300m. It contains 4.0 pounds of PBXN-113 explosive. It is similar in  <br> functioning to the HEDP although it is designed to function at higher impact  <br> angles. The spotting cartridge rounds are held on the outside of the end cap in a  <br> manner similar to the HEAA. <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for the SMAW rounds is  <br> 332993, Ammunition (Except Small Arms) Manufacturing. <br>  <br>  <br> All responses should be prepared in MS Word or PDF format, limited to ten (10)  <br> pages (test results may be included as attachments). Responses should also include  <br> a cover letter (not included in the page count), and, at a minimum, address the  <br> following:     <br>  <br> 1.	Provide sufficient information to support the company's claim that it  <br> presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to produce the SMAW  <br> Round variants. In addition to the SMAW Round variants, responders should offer  <br> information on how training is performed using the CP Round training rockets. The  <br> response shall indicate how the interested party(ies) have achieved a level of  <br> technical maturity such that they are capable of meeting the above requirements  <br> and successfully completing a Government Qualification program without additional <br>  research and development. <br>   <br> 2.	Provide a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes,  <br> inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production  <br> capabilities (including minimum sustainable and maximum attainable monthly  <br> production rates of the above described rounds or any similar SMAW rounds).    <br> In addition, provide a Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical  <br> production. <br>  <br> 3.	Provide a point of contact for your Company which will include: the  <br> corporate point of contact's name, address, website (if available), phone number,  <br> and email address.  Companies are to state their NAICS Code, Cage Code and Duns  <br> Number.  <br>  <br> 4.	Provide the respondents business size as it applies to NAICS code 332993   <br> and any socio-economic considerations.  <br>  <br> 5.	Provide history of similar services that your company has provided to  <br> other government agencies or other non-government customers. If applicable, please <br>  identify the agency or non-government customer. If you are unwilling to share  <br> your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or <br>  similar services commercially (outside the federal Government.). If you elect to  <br> identify your past and current customers to which you provided similar products,  <br> include the customers/company name and point of contact, phone number and  <br> address/e-mail where they can be contacted. <br>  <br> 6.	Respondents should identify any subcontractors that would be utilized in  <br> the production of  the SMAW rounds and approximate delivery of each item after  <br> award. <br>  <br> This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be  <br> construed as a  Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the  <br> U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All  <br> information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>*** This requirement was previously referenced under tracking number erte100038b.***<br />The US Department of Education (Department) seeks to contract with a small business to operate and make continuous improvements to the usefulness and usability of the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC).  ERIC is an online bibliographic and full-text digital library of education research, including journal articles and non-journal materials (e.g., technical report, conference paper).  ERIC is the world's largest and most frequently used digital library of education resources.  It is comprised of more than 1.4 million bibliographic records and more than 450,000 full-text materials indexed from 1966 to the present.  Each of ERIC's 1.4 million bibliographic records contains an abstract of a journal article or non-journal document, along with indexed information such as the author, title, and publication date.  The necessity and significance of ERIC to the field of education research is longstanding and widespread, as evidenced by over 250 million ERIC searches in 2012 and 6.5 million downloads of full-text documents in the same year.
<p>The objective of this requirement is to acquire the services of a contractor to operate and make continuous improvements to the usefulness and usability of the ERIC.  This procurement is comprised of three major activities: (1) maintaining the ERIC system, (2) re-organization of the IES (ies.ed.gov) and NCES (nces.ed.gov) websites, and (3) the design and implementation of an education practitioners' website on ERIC.  The first major activity or maintaining the ERIC system requires the contractor to index recently released documents, create abstracts, obtain agreements from journals to index their publications in ERIC, and to share ERIC data with vendors.  The second major activity will streamline the IES and NCES websites with ERIC and the vocabulary of the ERIC database and stop the duplication of work that is current on IES and ERIC websites where IES products are first published on IES websites before they are included in ERIC.  By allowing a contractor to publish all IES products in a single repository (i.e., the ERIC website), the Department will remove the duplication of work, reduce the level of effort, and realize cost savings while enabling ERIC to fulfill its mission.  The third major activity, or the design and implementation of the education practitioners' website, will introduce education practitioners who are unfamiliar with the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) to IES and its mission.  This procurement will be divided into the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull;	Task 1: Coordination and Communication with the Department;<br />&bull;	Task 2: Redesigning the Content of the IES Website;<br />&bull;	Task 3: Improving the ERIC Database;<br />&bull;	Task 4: Acquire and Link to Library Materials;<br />&bull;	Task 5: Restore Access to ERIC Full Text Documents;<br />&bull;	Task 6: Coordinate with Vendors;<br />&bull;	Task 7: Communication with Users;<br />&bull;	Task 8: Maintaining ERIC; and<br />&bull;	Task 9: Transition between Contracts.</p>
<p>In addition to the tasks outlined above, the procurement will include the following options:<br />&bull;	Option Year One: Repeated Performance of Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.2;<br />&bull;	Option Year Two: Repeated Performance of Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.2; <br />&bull;	Option Year Three Repeated Performance of Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.2; and<br />&bull;	Option Year Four: Repeated Performance of Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.2.</p>
<p>The Department is contemplating a hybrid contract for this requirement in which ten of the seven tasks are fixed-price, and two of the nine tasks are cost-reimbursement.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the anticipated contract is 60 months (one 12-month base period and four one-year option periods).  Task 2: Redesigning the Content of the IES Website will have a period of performance of 24 months, and Task 3: Improving the ERIC Database will have a period of performance of 12 months.  All other tasks are to be performed throughout the 12-month base year and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a total small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS Code is 518210 -- Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 6.2 -- Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  A hybrid contract is anticipated to be awarded in July 2013. <br />Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will be exclusively available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov on or about March 26, 2013.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor FBO for any amendments.  All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx as required by FAR 4. 1102.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit questions regarding this requirement to: Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov.</p>

<SOLNBR>N6134013R2404
<CONTACT>David Srinivasan 407.380.8126
<DESC>Notice of Intent

Program:  Event-Based Maintenance (EBM).
Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to contract with Andromeda Systems, Incorporated (Virginia Beach, VA), on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

This contemplated effort may result in the issuance of a three-month contract extension to the Event-Based Maintenance contract, N00421-08-C-0035. This contract is for the EBM software tool, part of a planned suite of software that originated with PMA-271, and the E-6B TACAMO aircraft. The EBM tool (and the planned suite) support(s) the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) in maintaining, planning, scheduling and executing (MPS&E) aircraft maintenance.
 The extensions Period of Performance would be 01-APR-2013 through 30-JUN-2013. 

Rationale:  This contemplated effort is a continuation of efforts that ASI began with contract 
N00421-00-D-0328, Delivery Order 0107, and continued with contract N00421-08-C-0035. ASI has Original Software Developer-level knowledge of the EBM tool. The software is in a developmental stage, with a large number of software fixes and improvements required. 

Use of ASI allows for Software-Development Reach-Back.  Other defense contractors and/or Government entities are unable to effectively reach back and draw from ASI resources regarding prior development of MPS&E. Use of another contractor would lead to increases in cost and development time because of the unique differences in coding/software-system design that are typical from software developer to software developer.
 

When the software tool suite reaches a mature development stage, the Government intends to competitively procure the maintenance of all MPS&E software.

Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding, and this notice is not a request for competitive proposals.
ASI is deemed the only source available because, IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The Government's intent is to issue a three-month contract extension for this developmental requirement.

<a href="mailto:gloria.thoguluva@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM SW) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07860-5000, on behalf of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5422, is assessing handgun technologies as well as production capacity of the US small arms industrial base.  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). <br>  <br> To facilitate the assessment, the following information is requested: <br>  <br> 1. Performance Improvement: Request information on potential improvements in handgun performance in the areas of accuracy and dispersion out to 50m, terminal performance, modularity, reliability and durability in all environments. <br>  <br> *  The handgun and ammunition combination should, at a range of 50 meters, have a 90% or better probability of hit on a 4 inch circle when fired from a test fixture.  It must maintain this throughout the life of the system. Systems are encouraged to utilize ergonomic and design improvements to minimize the effects of greater recoil energies, reducing the degradation of shooter-in-the-loop dispersion thereby improving the probability of hit. <br>  <br> *  Modularity includes but is not limited to compatibility with accessory items to include tactical lights, lasers and sound suppressors. There is specific interest in designs that would be adaptable and/or adjustable to provide enhanced ergonomics that ensure 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male military personnel access to controls, such as the safety, magazine release, slide release and all other applicable controls. There is also interest in designs that offer these enhanced ergonomics while providing full ambidextrous controls.  <br>  <br> *  The handgun ammunition's terminal ballistics will be evaluated at ranges of 0-50m, over 0-14 inches of ballistic gelatin, to determine whether it provides more lethality when compared to the current U.S. Military M882 ammunition fired from the M9.  Ammunition evaluated will meet international law of war conventions that bound current general purpose military ammunition. The Pistol evaluated must be capable of chamber pressures equal to or greater than SAAMI specification for the given cartridge, with prolonged reliability equal to or greater than the current M9.  However, the ability to accommodate higher chamber pressures in excess of 20% over SAAMI spec without degradation of reliability is of specific interest. <br>  <br> *  Reliability and Durability includes but is not limited to Mean Rounds between Stoppage (MRBS), Mean Rounds Between Failure (MRBF) and Service Life.  There is specific interest in designs with ratings of at least 2,000 rounds MRBS, 10,000 rounds MRBF and 35,000 round Service Life.  <br>  <br> 2. Production capacity estimates.  Request information on minimum and maximum monthly production rates for a military handgun and associated ammunition as well as the lead times to achieve these production rates. This estimate should consider a US based production facility by the third year of deliveries. This capacity should be above and beyond any current production orders or current sales. If new facilities are planned or required, so state.  A list of State and Federal agencies, as well as foreign governments, that have adopted the handgun should also be included. <br>  <br> 3. Detailed descriptions of proposed handguns to include pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the principles as well as general and specific capabilities behind the submissions.  Physical dimensions, weight and safety features should be included.  <br>  <br> 4. Summarized and detailed test data from any certified test facility that addresses improvements in the areas proposed. Test operating procedures utilized and independent evaluations are also solicited. <br>  <br> 5. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate. Request estimated pricing for the submission based on the following quantities:  250,000 to 550,000 handguns. <br>  <br>  <br> This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government use of such information. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its Acquisition Strategy, Performance Work Statement and Performance Specification.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INFORMATION: <br> Interested offerors should submit the information annotated above, in hard copy, by March 11, 2013 to: Army Contracting Command, Acquisition Center, ACC-NJ-SW, Bldg 9, Attn: Gloria Thoguluva, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07805. Electronic submissions may be sent to gloria.thoguluva.civ@mail.mil. Submissions shall not exceed 25 pages (8 x 11 inches), not including test data. Font shall be 12 pitch with one inch borders. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. All information marked {Proprietary to company name} will not be disclosed outside of the Department of Defense.  <br>  <br> Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number, e-mail address, and type of business (i.e. Small Business, Large Business, 8a Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business). <br>  <br> NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

You are advised that providing responses to the questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for future solicitation.  An important outcome of this research is the possibility of setting aside this acquisition for exclusive competitive participation within a specific Small Business Administration (SBA) program in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.201(a).   <br>   <br> The anticipated period of performance for the aforementioned requirement is 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2014 with four one-year option periods. <br>  <br> Description of services.  Joint Base Lewis-McChord is one of the largest and most modern military reservations in the United States, which includes Yakima Training Center (YTC), and is the premier military installation in the Northwest.  YTC has the best collective range in the Northwest.  YTC is an approximately 323,000 acre military reservation located in Yakima and Kittitas Counties in central Washington, approximately seven (7) miles north of the city of Yakima, Washington.  YTC is bounded on the north by Highway I-90; on the east by the Columbia River; Highway I-82 forms most of the western boundary; and the southern boundary is located approximately 6 Kilometers south of Yakima ridge.  YTC lies in a transitional zone between the Cascade Mountains and the Columbia Plateau.  The climate of the region surrounding YTC is characterized by hot, dry summers, and cold, dry-to-moist winters.  The average precipitation ranges from four (4) to six (6) inches per year.  Precipitation falls mainly during fall and spring.  Access to the Range and range operations may be hampered by snowfall and drifting snow.  Most of the land on YTC ranges from gently rolling to rugged terrain.  YTC is used primarily as a training area for large-scale military maneuvers, particularly those involving heavy wheeled and tracked vehicles (tanks and armored personnel carriers), and for training in use of large, long-range weapons.  Active Army, U.S. Army Reserves (USAR), National Guard (NG), Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, and Foreign Military Forces under a Standard of Forces Agreement that includes Canada and Japan in carrying out various military activities will utilize the Multi-Purpose Training Range (MPTR).  It is estimated that the MPTR, located in the northern section of YTC, will normally be utilized 248 days per year, equivalent to 380 eight (8)-hour man-days.    <br>  <br> Thus, the purpose requirement is to operate and maintain the MPTR (i.e., Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC)), Range 1487A, and provide supplemental target and repair support to the Digital Range at Yakima Training Center (YTC).  This effort is to provide training support to enhance the Training Units' abilities to accomplish missions successfully and support mobilization in accordance with Forces Command (FORSCOM) Regulation 350-2. <br>  <br> Performance shall include: <br>  <br> 1.	Operation and maintenance of Enhances Remote Equipment Target System (ERETS) equipment <br>  <br> 2.	Operation and maintenance of facilities <br>  <br> 3.	Grounds and tank trail maintenance <br>  <br> 4.	Operational Readiness: In order for the MPRC ranges to fulfill their training missions they must have a minimum number of targets up and in a completely functional mode.  This minimum number of targets will be known as the  quote mark operational readiness level quote mark  (ORL) and will be verified each day by a range test report.  The ORL for each of the MPRC ranges shall be 90% of all targets minus all targets for which Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) is being accomplished at that time.  <br>  <br> 5.	All administrative duties to include material requisitioning, quality control, development and maintenance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), records, files, and libraries of documents to include Federal, State, and Local regulations, codes, laws, technical manuals, and manufacturers' instructions and recommendations, which are necessary and related to the functions being performed, and shall compile historical data, prepare required reports.   <br>  <br> Disclaimer.  This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services.  Responses to this Sources Sought shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ). NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes and to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described, and to solicit industry feedback relative to various aspects of the proposed contract effort. The purpose of this notice is to also obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519-Other Computer Related Services with a small business size standard of $25.5 million.
<p><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Science and Technology for America's Reinvestment: Measuring the Effect of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness and Science (STAR METRICS), is a multi-agency venture comprising the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The goal of STAR METRICS is to build a data infrastructure that will support program evaluation, science policy analysis, and enable the development of metrics related to estimating the effects of federal funding of science and technology research. STAR METRICS will achieve this goal through collaboration between federal agencies, research institutions, the scientific community, and the public. A key to the efforts of this consortium is data collection, management and dissemination guided by policy and relevant federal regulations. Additional information about the program can be found at the following: http://www.starmetrics.nih.gov</p>
<p>STAR METRICS is managed by the Office of Extramural Research (OER) at NIH. The STAR METRICS website is hosted by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) at NIH and information technology services are currently provided through contractors with oversight from federal staff.</p>
<p>STAR METRICS is organized into two levels of activities. Level I relates to estimating employment resulting from research awards. Level II is in development and will concern development of a database of federal R&amp;D awards. OER expresses an interest in STAR METRICS' streamlined yet scalable operations while achieving cost reduction as it begins to develop Level II activities. An early practical outcome of Level II will be development of a searchable database of awards with information from participating federal agencies. It will be important to design and implement this database to be interoperable with Level I as well as complementary projects and technologies such as SciENCV (http:// rbm.nih.gov/profile_project.htm)</p>
<p>Data for STAR METRICS are collected from voluntarily participants such as universities and are also integrated from existing, but separately maintained, federal agency sources. Great importance is placed on data quality and procedures associated with collection, maintenance, and provenance of data. In addition, the assumptions underlying any calculations used to generate quantitative reports are expected to be made available to the scientific community for evaluation and suggestions for improvement. Consequently, all procedures related to data management are expected to be extensively documented, verifiable, and independently reproducible.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to acquire professional IT services for various STAR METRICS activities which will enable continued collection, archival, analysis, maintenance, and dissemination of data and results from this multi-year, longitudinal effort. The NIH/OD/OER seeks information from interested vendors on cost-effective approaches for STAR METRICS' consortium data collection, management, processing, and dissemination of approved information.</p>
<p>Project Requirements/Tasks</p>
<p>Services acquired will ensure:</p>
<p>1) Technical support to the users of STAR METRICS.<br />2)Maintenance of the existing repository of Level I STAR METRICS data which contains confidential information relating to employment generated by research awards by to institutions. <br />3)Design, development and maintenance of a Level II database of research project information as per requirements provided by the STAR METRICS Program Managers and the Interagency Working Group. This database will be populated with information provided by participating federal agencies.<br />4)Maintenance and enhancement of the STAR METRICS website.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The period of performance will be a base year plus three (3) additional 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE<br />In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194.

This notice constitutes as a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00178-11-Q-1902 which solicits/requests white papers for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD).  White papers including a rough order of magnitude (ROM) which are meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches towards advancing the state of the art technologies used in targeting systems may be submitted.
  There is an urgent need for novel technologies capable of improving targeting accuracy.  
 
DESCRIPTION:  The current topic areas of interest/objectives include but are not limited to:  

Topic: A. Azimuth Sensing Technology
There is an urgent need for technologies capable of improving azimuth determination.  Current weapon systems are able to engage targets with an accuracy that exceeds existing targeting equipment capabilities.  Laser designation is presently the only practical solution to the accuracy problem; however, the drawback is that the operator is vulnerable to counterattacks during the designation.  Accurate knowledge of a users location coupled with range, azimuth, and elevation to target, will allow for a targets location to be known well enough to call for a precision strike.
 

The goal is to provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing capability for use in handheld targeting devices to allow the user a level of self navigation (6 Degrees Of Freedom).  The technology shall reduce Target Location Errors (TLE) associated with digital magnetic compasses; as well as allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, day or night, inside buildings and while wearing body armor.  The technology will be an improvement to the accuracy available from a digital magnetic compass regardless of the magnetic environment.  The goal is to eventually reduce TLE to less than 10m, thereby permitting accurate target location at ranges of up to 10km from observer to target.  The limitations imposed by user objectives are not conducive to GPS interferometers and celestial compass technologies.
  The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing; however, novel ideas are encouraged. 

Desired Capabilities:  a) Could be integrated into a handheld application; b) Less than 1 mil vertical angle accuracy; c) Boresightable to optics; d) Volume no more than 1 cu in; e) 1 mil azimuth accuracy; f) 0.25 lb; g) 360 degrees per second operational slew rate (without recalibration); h) Less than 60 sec start-up time.

Topic: B . Laser Target Designation Technology
Currently fielded USMC Laser Target Designators (LTDs) emit a laser which is encoded with Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) codes.  These LTDs are class IV lasers and emit 30-80 milliJoules (mJ) of laser energy.  A 50-80 mJ system typically weighs 12 lbs, and a 30-50 mJ system typically weighs 4 lbs.

The USMC is interested in novel technologies and materials which are able to reduce the size, weight, electrical power, and cost (both system and sustainment cost) of conventional, PRF-encoded LTDs.

Topic: C.
  Eye Safe Laser Target Designation Technology
NSWCDD has been tasked by ONR to investigate the viability of a high pulse rate / low energy laser designation and guidance capability.  The combination of many low energy pulses has several advantages.  First, the system can be more covert since integration of pulses is required to detect the laser.  Newer very high velocity projectiles that are being developed will require data rates that are substantially higher that todays lower pulse rate designators.  The lower energy per pulse requires the designator to develop less peak power, potentially decreasing the size and power requirements of the designator.  Finally, fewer pulses can be integrated at closer ranges to give an equivalent signal to noise ratio.
  Thus, the data rate can be increased upon closing on the target which yields higher data rates at closer ranges (where it is needed).

The development of this technology presents some technical challenges. First, narrow pulses are desired to increase the instantaneous signal to noise ratio.  This requirement drives the sample rate of the signal processor up.  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) can handle the processing requirements but memory access to perform the pulse integration is a challenge.  Much like GPS, multiple correlators must be implemented to accommodate timing uncertainties.  Each correlator must have read/write access to high-speed memory.  Given the limited memory of the FPGA, a limited number of correlators can be implemented.

A second challenge is the clock stability required of the designator and seeker.
 Since multiple pulses must be integrated, any clock skew between the designator and seeker will cause the integrator to walk relative to the designator pulse and fail to correlate before the requisite number of pulses.  Consequently, there is a need for highly stable clocks for both the designator and seeker.

Topic: D. Laser Seeker/Sensors Technology
Given the engagements that are required in an urban environment, Class 4 lasers present a hazard to troops and civilians.  To reduce this hazard, it would be advantageous to switch from the current designation lasers to a 1550 nm designation laser. Unfortunately, there are several technical roadblocks.  First, while there are a plethora of detectors at 1550 nm, these detectors are small single detectors.
  Such small detectors limit the field of view of the seeker.  Due to advancements in gyro technology, newer systems are designed without gimbals (strapdown).  Consequently, even a larger field of view is required.  Current 1550 nm detectors are too small and have too high of a capacitance (affects noise and bandwidth).  There is a need for novel 1550 nm detector technologies and configurations to fill this need.

Topic:  E. Integrated Day/Night Sensors Technology
Prove the feasibility of an inexpensive single imaging sensor that provides day video, enhanced night video and the ability to view laser wavelengths of 860 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm.  Current state of technology in FPA imaging systems has provided a number of technologies (silicon, InGaAs, HgCdTe, and CMOS imagers) that are sensitive to near infra-red energy, making many of them useful for detecting laser energy at 860 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm.
  A single FPA with the ability to present day and night imagery superimposed with the image of the laser spot is desired.  There is also a need for extending night viewing ranges through the use of pulsed IR laser illumination gated imagery.  Reasonable technology cost is of key importance.  

Topic:  F. Optics Technology
Prove the feasibility of a lightweight miniaturized optical system capable of recognizing 1.4 x 1.7 m target at ranges up to 5km.  The optical technology would be coupled to day and night imaging systems and see-spot viewers for an indirect view capability.

Advances in sensor technologies have enabled the use of indirect view imaging for targeting applications.  This enables the use of novel technologies such as folded optical systems which allow for longer light path in a smaller package.
  Any improvement which reduces size and weight is encouraged.  Ideally, the design would have a single light path; however, designs which allow for multiple light paths may be necessary.

Topic: G. Laser Spot Imaging/Tracking and PRF Code Reading Technology
The currently fielded USMC Laser Target Designator (LTD) is the AN/PEQ-17, the Portable Lightweight Designator Rangefinder (PLDR).  The PLDR contains an integrated, although limited, Laser Spot Imaging (LSI) capability.  The integrated LSI relies on the user to select a combination of two filters that can be manually adjusted over the LSI camera aperture on the front of the system.  Even so, the available combinations of filters are not adequate to see the laser spot under all environmental and lighting conditions.

The AN/PAS-25, Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI) is also currently fielded within the USMC.
  The TLSI is an approximately 8 lbs cooled mid wave thermal imager which is also sensitive to the 1.06 micron wavelength. 

The USMC is interested in technologies and materials which are able to reduce the size, weight, electrical power, and cost (both system and sustainment cost) of laser spot imagers.  Also of interest are ways of reducing cooling requirements and start-up (cool-down) times.  The USMC is also interested in LSI technologies which are able to read PRF codes and display the PRF number to the user.  The USMC is also interested in LSIs which are able to view laser spots at multiple wavelengths.  For example, the ability to view Class I eyesafe rangefinding lasers (typically 1550-1570), Class IV 1064 nm lasers, and IR Pointers (typically around 860 nm), would also be beneficial.

A set-aside determination will be made based in part on the capabilities a firm is able to demonstrate in response to this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.<br /><br /><strong>Background: <br /></strong><br />The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are working together to enhance community and individual resiliency before, during and after a disaster. This initiative is in support of the complementary core missions of the Agencies which are to build and sustain our nation's capability to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters and to engage local resources to ensure the "whole community" is supported. ASPR and FEMA have partnered to help identify potential solutions to enable individuals with access and functional needs to sustain and extend the use of their durable medical equipment (DME), or medical devices powered by electricity, such as oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and intravenous infusion pumps, and to shelter at home or with friends/ family during prolonged power outages. Additionally, this technology can enable local government agencies and/ or local community organizations to know where devices are located in order to help identify locations/areas where services and resources are needed.<br /><br />In addition to "health resilience technology" utility during disasters, the technologies should have day to day utility for DME dependents. Ideally solutions with a data component will leverage existing open source technologies that could be readily utilized or adapted to deliver capabilities in the following areas of focus:<br /><br />&bull; Low-power consumption sensor units (ideally composed of open source hardware) that can interface with DME and automatically transmit location, type of DME, remaining charge, time stamp and other relevant information over several spectrum (e.g. zigbee, Wi-Fi, CDMA, amateur radio).<br />&bull; Power generation / storage devices (batteries) that do not require frequent recharging to provide electricity to DME during periods of electrical outage. <br />&bull; The ability to share relevant device data with state, regional, and local government and with community organizations in format that can be universally consumed.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:<br /><br /></strong>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) requests capability statements from entities with experience working successfully in any or all of the aforementioned health resilience technology focus areas listed above. Please address as many of the following activities in your capability statement that are feasible and relevant:<br /><br /><strong>I.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any small business firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 811310 for an upcoming requirement for the National Ice Core Laboratory. The U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL) is a specialized facility in Lakewood, CO, which stores about 17,000 meters of ice cores that have been drilled from the ice-covered regions of the world, for the purpose of the scientific investigation of the past climate of the earth, and the study of its atmosphere in past times. The cost, to date, of acquiring the samples stored in the NICL is approximately $350M. However, even if such an amount of money were available to replace the samples if lost, it would likely be impossible to replicate them. The ice core samples must be stored at temperatures well below freezing, within narrow ranges of variation. It is not enough that the cores be prevented from melting: if the stored samples approach freezing, some components of the old air and other substances they contain can migrate out of the ice, and mislead scientists who make measurements on the ice, rendering the samples useless. If the temperatures vary too much even within a range of cold temperatures, the ice can undergo disastrous structural changes. The ice core storage part of the NICL freezer consists of three rooms of different sizes, held at different temperatures by a refrigeration system controlled by computer interface, run by a two-stage system using R22 refrigerant fluid with multiple reciprocating Mycom compressors of different capacities. This requirement is for ongoing maintenance and repairs of the NICL refrigeration system, control computer, and freezer building and its ancillary parts. This requirement also includes emergency response and repair for refrigeration or control computer system failures, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week including holidays. The National Ice Core Laboratory refrigeration system consists of four 4-cylinder Mycom reciprocating compressors and two 8-cylinder Mycom reciprocating compressors; two evaporative condenser towers, four evaporators operating at -38C (-36F), two evaporator coils operating as a single evaporator operating at -24C (-11F); and two evaporator coils operating as a single evaporator operating at approximately +4C (+39F).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY:  This announcement is seeking information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of the interest, capabilities and qualifications of Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB's), in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 109-461.  
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16 has a requirement for on-going facilities construction, alterations, and repair of buildings, structures and other real property, and minor construction relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), for the following VISN 16 locations:  VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (Biloxi, MS; Pensacola, FL; Eglin AFB, FL; Panama City, FL); G.V.

Any contracts awarded will cover work at all three medical centers and associated outpatient clinics.  Separate contracts will not be awarded for each separate facility/location.
The anticipated contracts will include a base year plus four (4) option years and will be awarded as Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC's).  It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of eight (8) contracts awarded assuming sufficient qualified contractors submit proposals.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC Controls, fire suppression, intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, and other related work.  Projects will be design/bid/build from already completed designs, or projects including a statement of work and using the VA Master Construction Specifications (http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/spec.asp )
The VA anticipates awarding MATOC's in the following three categories:
Category 1 - Task order amounts between $2,000.00 and $750,000.00
Category 2 - Task order amounts between $750,000.01 and $2,000,000.00

<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-13-03
<RESPDATE>041913
<ARCHDATE>04192014
<CONTACT>Dr. Adam Russell, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-13-03@iarpa.gov
<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to solicit information relevant to a possible future IARPA investment. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support the development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA solicitation and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses.</span></strong> The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
<p><strong><br />Background and Scope<br /></strong>IARPA is soliciting responses to this RFI in order to assess the extent to which Alternate Reality Environments (AREs)i, such as Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), may provide capabilities that allow for high-quality, externally valid social, behavioral and psychological research in near-realworld contexts.</p>
<p>This RFI invites interested parties to respond with ideas, approaches, and evidence that can address one, some, or all of the following questions:<br />1. What, if any, social, behavioral, and/or psychological research has been conducted using AREs (to include ARGs)?<br />2. Is there evidence that ARE/ARG-based research provides greater external validity than other methods of social, behavioral, and/or psychological research?<br />3. What are the key elements to incorporate when designing or using AREs/ARGs for research purposes? What may be the biggest challenges for designing or using<br />AREs/ARGs for research?<br />4. How might one design an ARE/ARG that combines periods of controlled data collection as well as periods of "free play" and interactions?<br />5. How might subject recruitment, screening, and informed consent be performed for an ARE/ARG, while limiting priming effects that may occur when explaining the purpose of a research study?<br />6. What protections can be put in place to maintain the privacy, safety, and anonymity of subjects? How have previous AREs/ARGs addressed these issues? Responses should consider issues regarding the collection of data via personal identifiers that may be sensitive (e.g. user names, phone numbers, emails, IP addresses, etc.), other data that may potentially be sensitive, and data security and protections.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br /></strong>IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential IARPA investment (such as a program, seedlings, or a Grand Challenge). IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the U.S. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged. Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-13-03;<br />2. A single overview briefing chart (limited to 1 page, not including cover sheet and references) graphically depicting the key ideas and a written description addressing one or more of the key questions above (limited to 5 pages, not including cover sheet and references, in minimum 12<br />point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins);<br />3. An attached list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />Submission Instructions to Respondents Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 pm Eastern on Friday April 19, 2013.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i AREs create an "alternate" reality out of the real world by using different media (e.g. print, cell phones, websites, augmented reality, etc.), to superimpose fictional narratives on physical reality. While AREs are constructed and communicated through multi-media, they involve having people accomplish tasks or interact with others using live actions in the physical world. In this way, research using AREs would presumably be different from research in "virtual worlds" (where tasks/interactions are entirely online), observational research (which may lack experimental control to test specific variables) and laboratory research (which may require subjects to come to a testing site that is clearly distinct from their daily experience of the world). For more on examples of existing AREs/ARGs, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game and http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/08/conspiracy-for-good-a-recap-of-an-arg-by-the-creator-of-heroes/ .</p>

What do you expect to be the technical evolution, roadmap, and real-world deployment from today's vehicles and infrastructure to a partially or fully automated transportation system?<br /><br />7. What are the current and applicable technical standards and what are the needs for new ones? What needs to be standardized? What should not be standardized?<br /><br />8. How do you think the technical testing, verification, validation, and certification should be performed, and what facilities and capabilities are needed?<br /><br />9. What type of facilities and capabilities do you expect to be needed for testing? Do these facilities and capabilities currently exist?<br /><br />10. What do you think are the minimum levels of reliability recommended for achieving increased levels of vehicle automation? Is the level of reliability necessary for full automation attainable in an automotive environment? Are there examples of complex automotive systems achieving this level of reliability?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human Factors <br /><br />The ultimate goal of the human factors considerations will be to ensure traffic safety by avoidance or mitigation of any unintended consequences introduced by automation into the surface transportation system. Note that in such a system, the human element is not restricted to the driver, but also includes anything or anybody that could affect-or be affected by-the human-vehicle system's trajectory. For this purpose, the Volpe Center seeks information from manufacturers, industry, user groups, and academia identifying and discussing the main issues emerging when considering multiple types of operators, operations, environments including infrastructure and automation philosophies; and on any other topic relevant from a human factors point of view. Whenever possible, interested parties should provide the underlying reasoning for their answers. Interested parties are encouraged to reference the literature or subject matter experts. The human factors aspects of the research plan to be developed by the U.S. DOT will examine the human-vehicle-environment/infrastructure system from the point of view of the driver and the pedestrian. <br />Where the respondent is currently working on automation, please identify whether the focus is on development of fully autonomous driving by the automated systems (i.e. the driver relinquishes control of the vehicle to the automation) or rather, on keeping drivers in control while augmenting their perception, cognition, and performance via automated systems. Reasons for choosing either focus are also of interest. <br /><br />1. What is your purpose for developing automated vehicles or corresponding infrastructure systems? What benefit and challenges do you expect from vehicles with different levels of automated systems operating autonomously, i.e., without driver intervention, or vehicles with different levels of automation supporting or augmenting drivers' perception, cognition, and performance?<br /><br />2. What type of drivers, vehicle operations, pedestrians, driving environments (or scenarios), and infrastructure types are you designing for? Do your designs anticipate and provide for vehicle operators with special needs?<br /><br />3. What do you think is the best way of deploying different types of automated vehicles to different types of drivers and travelers in different types of environments without jeopardizing safety?<br /><br />4. What training and certification, if any, do you think drivers and travelers will need in order to operate/ride vehicles at any level of augmentation or autonomy safely in any type of environment/infrastructure? Will riders of such vehicles need training and/or certification to take over in case of failures? Will pedestrians operating in such systems need any special instructions?<br /><br />5. How should drivers' and riders' trust in the automated systems be managed so that they will be able to benefit from them without over-reliance? How will pedestrians' trust in such systems be managed?<br /><br />6. What is the appropriate level of transparency of the automated systems to the drivers so they can safely use the systems? How do you achieve this appropriate level of understanding of the underlying functions, limitations, and contingencies of the automated systems by drivers?<br /><br />7. What type of system design, training, and/or standardization among vehicles will enable drivers to successfully switch between different levels and types of automation within and between vehicles, environments, and infrastructure?<br /><br />8. Are there any efforts to standardize the automated systems' human-machine interface across manufacturers? Please provide details.<br /><br />9. What are the human-factors lessons from other industries, transportation or otherwise, that are applicable to vehicle automation in surface transportation systems?<br /><br />10. Do you know of any working groups, nationally and internationally, that are addressing these questions? Please provide details.<br /><br />11. Any other human factors considerations not addressed above?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submitting Responses<br /><br />This RFI has been assigned a solicitation number&nbsp;for administrative and reference purposes only.&nbsp; This&nbsp;RFI&nbsp;is not a solicitation.&nbsp; Interested parties may submit or identify comments, ideas, answers, or issues that address all or any of the topics and questions above.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a sole source award to the ILEC in which past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the ILEC accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of any other ILEC within the same state region and with other E911 contracts within this office.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the ILEC's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation, identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the ILEC's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the ILEC will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the ILEC's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the ILEC will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the ILEC's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the ILEC will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the ILEC's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the ILEC will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the ILEC's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an ILEC without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the ILEC may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, the ILEC must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov.  From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules.  The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

<p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS <br />The Government must receive your proposal no later than the time and date specified in the request for proposal or subsequent amendment(s). Offerors must meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions and technical requirements. Failure to follow these instructions may result in an offeror being ineligible for award. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be furnished in the following format with the numbers of copies as specified below: Email submissions of proposals are preferred and acceptable as long as all required information is submitted, including required signatures. Faxed Responses will NOT be accepted. Technical Proposal MUST be submitted as a separate document from all other proposal documents.<br />1.1 Proposals shall be submitted in two parts - a Technical proposal and a Price/Business proposal. Each part shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the other. <br />1.2 Offerors are cautioned that sufficient and detailed information must be provided to enable the Government to evaluate their proposals fully in accordance with the evaluation and award criteria contained herein. The Government is not obligated to ask for additional information and in the absence of appropriate information; the proposal will be rated deficient.<br />1.3 All Evaluation Factors excepting Relevant Past Performance will be incorporated into the resulting contract by reference at time of award and retain the full force and effect as all of the other contractual terms and conditions hold therein.<br /><br />PROPOSAL DOCUMENTS<br />The following documents shall be submitted by the offeror for evaluation to be considered responsive:<br />1. Price Proposal, Schedule of Items. Submission of ALL items <br />2. Representations and Certifications. AGAR 452.209- 70 (Alt 1) and AGAR 452.209-71 (Alt 1)<br />4. Technical Proposal. Submit 1 electronic copy (PDF or Word) or 2 hard copies of the Technical Proposal <br />Special Notes:<br />1. The offeror must submit an offer for all items. Round to the nearest cent.<br />2. In the event of an error in extending the total price, unit prices will govern unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer.<br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past performance with similar installations, including references.<br />2. Ability to meet specifications<br />3. Ability to meet time<br />4. Price<br />Technical and past performance when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Failure to submit this information will render the offer as non-responsive.<br />&bull; All Offerors who submit a proposal for this project must be registered to the System for Award Management (SAM) in accordance with FAR 52.204-7 and FAR 52.204-8 (Previously CCR and ORCA). <br />&bull; All Offeror's must respond to the required evaluation criteria of the solicitation to be considered for award. <br />Technical Proposal Instructions<br />Technical proposals will be evaluated to determine the ability of the contractor to meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed description of the organization, techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals that merely paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/statement of work, or use such phrases as "will comply" or "standard techniques will be employed" will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly provide the following:<br />(1) Technical Capability<br />a. Past Performance: Provide evidence of successful installations in other remote locations similar to this project.<br />b. Ability to meet the above specifications<br />c. Ability to meet timeline.<br />The contractor will meet the Acceptable rating level by demonstrating they have the organization and equipment needed to accomplish the work described in the solicitation in a timely and efficient manner. Additional merit may be awarded to vendors who exceed the standard. <br />(2) Past Performance <br />The technical proposal must address past performance for both the offeror and proposed subcontractors. OFFERORS SHOULD PROVIDE ONLY THE INFORMATION LISTED BELOW. PERFORMANCE INFORMATION WILL BE REQUESTED FROM REFERENCES PROVIDED.<br />Contractors may also discuss past accomplishments that indicate your firm's ability to perform the work required by this solicitation. The government will contact a sample of the vendor's past customers to determine the rating for this factor. The currency and relevance of the information and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. The Forest Service considers that current (within the last 3 years), relevant (similar in nature and scope) performance is a better indicator of ability than older or less similar work. Any offeror who does not have a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will receive a rating of neutral. <br />Factor a, Business Relations, is the most important sub-factor. The other sub-factors are all equal in value. The four sub-factors will be evaluated to determine an overall rating for past performance. <br />a. Business Relations - the standard is met by contractors who have a history of effective working relationships and cooperative behavior toward the employing entity.<br />b. Compliance with Contract Terms and Conditions - the standard is met by contractors who have consistently met contract terms and specifications and demonstrated conformance to standards of good workmanship.<br />c. Timeliness of Performance - the standard is met by contractors who have consistently demonstrated compliance with contract schedules and have completed work on-time.<br />d. Customer Satisfaction - the standard is met by contractors who have consistently satisfied their customer's expectations as evidenced by the willingness to rehire.<br />At a minimum, provide the following information:<br />&bull; Names, telephone and email address of principal officials who were in charge of the project and that are familiar with your performance. <br />&bull; A description of the work performance, <br />&bull; The agency/company or individuals you worked for, <br />&bull; The size (value) and location of the contracts, <br />&bull; Contract numbers.</p>
<p>Individuals or businesses without prior contracts as a business entity should list contracts and subcontracts completed by predecessor companies or key personnel. <br />The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has authorized Federal agencies to collect past performance information under OMB clearance number 9000-0142. Both the information provided in the proposal and Government records will be used to evaluate the Offeror's past performance; however, references other than those listed may also be contacted. <br />The Contractors will earn the Exceptional rating if all references rate the Contractor as Excellent on all subfactors listed above. <br />The Contractor will meet the Acceptable rating level if a majority of references rate the Contractor as Acceptable or better.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE EVALUATION FACTORS <br />Since an Offeror's proposal(s) must be compliant in order for it to be eligible for award, compliance of the offer is a mandatory solicitation requirement. In general, the Government considers the non-price factors of past performance, proposed schedule, and experience in similar work to be in descending order of importance. <strong>ALL EVALUATION FACTORS OTHER THAN PRICE, WHEN COMBINED, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN COST OR PRICE IN THE AWARD DECISION.<br /></strong>The TEB will evaluate each proposal strictly on its content and will not assume that performance will include anything not specified in the proposal. The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with the procedures established herein. The technical evaluation panel will then assign to each evaluation criterion a final adjective consensus rating of exceptional, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable based on the following descriptions:<br /><strong><br />Exceptional<br /></strong>An exceptional proposal contains significant strengths and no weaknesses. The proposal exceeds the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the Statement Of Work (SOW). The proposal offers value-added methodologies for improving service that benefits the Government. The evaluator has no doubt that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the SOW if the technical approach proposed is followed. The Offeror acknowledges risks and develops an approach that proactively identifies and mitigates risks, and looks to reduce or eliminate future risks.<br /><strong><br />Good<br /></strong>A good proposal contains significant strengths and only a few minor weaknesses. The Offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements as defined in the SOW. The evaluator has a high degree of confidence that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the SOW if the technical approach proposed is followed. The Offeror acknowledges technical or schedule risk and develops an approach capable of <br /><br /><strong>Acceptable<br /></strong>An acceptable proposal contains strengths that outweigh any existing weaknesses. The Offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the SOW. The evaluator is confident that the Offeror can successfully achieve the requirements in the SOW if the technical approach proposed is followed. <br /><br /><strong>Marginal<br /></strong>The proposal meets the bare minimum performance and technical capability requirements defined in the SOW, and also have significant weaknesses. The evaluator is not confident that the Offeror can successfully complete the required tasking without significant Government oversight or participation. The proposal either fails to address risks or the proposed risk mitigation approach is not deemed to be sufficient to manage the risk.<br /><br /><strong>Unacceptable<br /></strong>An unacceptable proposal that contains one or more significant weaknesses and deficiencies. Proposal fails to meet specified minimum performance and technical capability requirements defined in the SOW. The evaluator is confident that the Offeror will be unable to successfully complete the required tasking. The proposal does not adequately acknowledge or address risk, mitigate risk, or may actually introduce risk.</p>
<p>When the adjective ratings for each criterion of each proposal have been finally assigned, the evaluation panel members will jointly discuss each proposal separately and develop an evaluation panel consensus adjective rating for each technical proposal (a single adjective rating for each proposal will be determined). The criteria established on the rating sheet will be used in developing the consensus adjective rating for each proposal. If a consensus rating cannot be reached, the Chairperson of the Evaluation Board will decide which rating is most representative.<br /><br />The final rating assigned to each proposal shall be based on an average of all individual ratings, i.e.<br /><br />If there are three (3) raters and two (2) provide an exceptional rating with the third providing an acceptable rating the overall rating assessed will be an exceptional minus.</p>
<p>Standard Definitions <br /><strong>Strength<br /></strong>A strong attribute or quality of particular worth or utility; an inherent asset. Note: Simple adherence to the requirements or ability to meet a requirement is compliance but should not be listed as strength.<br /><br /><strong>Weakness</strong> A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance<br /><br /><strong>Deficiency<br /></strong>A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED WITH THE SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM) IN ACCORDANCE TO FAR 52.204-7AND FAR 52.204.8. OFFERORS MUST RESPOND TO ALL CRITERIA INCLUDED IN SECTION M OFFERORS WHO FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.</p>

<p>8.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: None additional.</p>
<p><br /><br />2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to establish policy and procedures for the proper use of Fall Preventer Devices (FPDs) during drills, testing, and maintenance of lifeboats.<br /><br />The position of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is that lifeboat release mechanisms are required to be protected against accidental or premature release. The USCG categorizes FPDs as maintenance items and has not issued any policy on their use.</p>
<p>The IMO considers the use of FPDs as an interim risk mitigation measure to be used with existing on-load release hooks, at the discretion of the Master, and pending the implementation of improved hook designs and safety features.</p>
<p><br />3 APPLICABILITY: <br />3.1 Current release date: April 2012<br />3.2 Applies to all ships that have lifeboat Release and Retrieval Systems (RRS) that do not meet the new amendments to Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Regulation III/1.5, Chapter IV, Lifesaving Appliances Code, Sections 4.4.7.6.4 to 4.4.7.6.6. Vessels will replace existing RRS with improved hooks that meet SOLAS requirements during scheduled dry-dock periods.</p>
<p>FPDs shall be used ONLY during drills, testing, inspection, and maintenance of lifeboats<br />3.3 Launching of Lifeboats without FPDs: FPDs shall not be left in place during normal operations or during actual abandon ship events (emergency operations). All FPDs shall be removed from lifeboats at the conclusion of the drill, test, inspection, or maintenance and stowed in a separate, controlled location. <br />3.4 Ordering: All FPDs shall be ordered by the class manager to ensure consistency by class.</p>
<p>4 PROCEDURE<br />4.1 Background: <br />4.1.1 A number or serious accidents have occurred with on-load lifeboat release systems during drills and servicing since becoming mandatory in 1986. <br />4.1.2 FPDs provide a secondary load path which prevents the lifeboat from falling during an accidental release of the on-load hook or the failure of the release mechanism.<br />4.1.3 The approved FPD for MSFSC is a strop or sling. This method was adopted since it is easily visible by inspection. A locking pin shall not be used since it can be easily</p>
<p>Enclosure 2.2</p>
<p><br />4.1.4 overlooked. Existing on-load release hooks shall NOT be modified to provide a locking pin insertion point.</p>
<p>4.2 General Requirements for the Use of Strops/Slings: The following should be considered when using synthetic strops or slings as FPDs:<br />&bull; Strops/slings shall be permanently marked with their date of entry into service. Strops/slings shall also be numbered for easy accounting in the "# of total #" format.<br />&bull; An initial functional test of FPDs is required before their use. This test shall demonstrate that the strops/slings do not interfere in the operation of the lifeboat or launching equipment. The test shall consist of lowering the boat and retrieving. Launching the boat is not required. <br />&bull; Any unintentional, dynamic shock loading requires the strop/sling to be replaced and associated attachment points inspected.<br />&bull; Attachment points shall be clearly marked to prevent the strops/slings from being connected to the wrong part of the block or on-load release hook.<br />&bull; A warning sign shall be placed on the release handle and a "Remove Before Operation" flag shall be attached to the strop/sling, to ensure that strops/slings are removed prior to activating release mechanism. "Remove Before Operation" (RBF-8) flags may be purchased from http://www.aeroconsystems.com/misc/beforeflight.htm.</p>
<p>WARNING:<br />DO NOT ACTIVATE RELEASE MECHANISM WITH FALL<br />PREVENTER DEVICES (FPDs) IN PLACE</p>
<p>During drills and testing the FPDs shall be attached before commencement of lowering the lifeboat. When the lifeboat is approximately 1 meter above the water the davit operator will stop lowering the lifeboat to allow the FPDs to be removed. The davit operator will then resume lowering the lifeboat to allow for testing of the release hook mechanisms. <br />&bull; During drills and testing, once the on-load release hooks have been connected for lifeboat recovery, the FPDs (strops/slings) should be reattached before the boat is hoisted clear of the water.</p>
<p><br />Enclosure 2.2</p>
<p>Strops/slings are CONTROLLED DEVICES and their use shall be monitored by the Chief Mate. Strops/slings shall be checked out at the beginning and turned into the Chief Mate before the end of the work day.</p>
<p>4.3 Inspections: Strops/slings shall be inspected before their initial use and at six month intervals. The inspection shall be logged and consist of the following:<br />&bull; Manufacturer certification documenting tensile strength providing a safety factor of at least six. <br />&bull; Permanently marked with date of entry into service and numbered.<br />&bull; Inspect the entire surface of webbing for damage. <br />&bull; Examine for frayed edges, broken fibers, paint, pulled stitches, cuts or chemical damage. Broken webbing strands generally appear as tufts on the webbing surface.<br />&bull; Inspect hardware for cracks or other defects.<br />&bull; Ensure load rating and safety factor match between strop and rigging gear.<br />&bull; <br />5 RECORDS:<br /><br />5.1 Manufacturer certification of tensile strength.<br />5.2 Log inspection prior to first use and every six months.<br />5.3 SMS Checklist 7.21-001-01-ALL, Lifeboat Fall Preventer Device Checklist shall be filled out prior to each use.</p>
<p>6 DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>6.1 Strops/slings: weight handling material made out of synthetic fibers designed to absorb shock loads; a looped line used to hoist, lower, or carry.<br />6.2 Dynamic shock loading: a very large acceleration or deceleration of a static load (for example, a lifeboat falling because the hook slipped).<br />6.3 Functional test: measure the ability of the components of the system to function as designed (for example, can the strop take the load of a lifeboat without interfering with lifting and lowering capability).<br />7 REFERENCES</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Subparts 12.6 and 13.105, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisitions Circular (FAC) 2005-66, February 28, 2013.
This procurement is a small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS classification code is 333618 with a size standard of 1,000 employees and PSC 2815.
SPECIFICATIONS: The National Park Service, Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve (GLBA) is soliciting quotes for charge air coolers. 
LINE ITEMS: 
Line Item 00010: MESABI Charge Air Cooler 275kw L&M Radiator Mesabi Charge Air Cooler, Part Number 120066 Quantity: 2 EA The minimum needs of the Government are for a Charge Air Cooler with the following performance characteristics: Air-to-air heat exchange radiator (Charge Air Cooler) with field replaceable tubes in the radiator core without the use of welding or brazing.  The radiator must be capable of cooling 880 cfm of 430 degree F air at 81" Hg pressure to 120 degrees F at a 77 degree F ambient air temperature.  The maximum pressure drop across the CAC should be 3" Hg or less.  The electric motor on the fan should be suitable for use with a variable frequency drive.  Overall dimensions of the unit should be less than 48" tall, 48" wide and 38" deep, including motor.  The equipment should be suitable for installation in an outdoor location exposed to wind rain and snow with temperatures that range from -20 to + 80 degrees F.  The radiators are to be used for charge air cooling in association with a diesel engine generator.   
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The use of the following L&M Radiator Mesabi Charge Air Cooler, Part Number 120066 is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured or installed by another company:  There are no other domestic manufacturers of this type of equipment that provide a product that is field repairable.  All other sources produce equipment that requires removal of the core and then a welded or brazed repair, which cannot be performed onsite by the staff available.  Other manufacturers produce charge air coolers that are not field repairable, but do meet the performance requirements, however none of them are small enough to fit in the space available.  Use of these other products would require the construction of a shelter to protect the units from the elements as well as shipping the cores offsite for repair.
Line Item 00020: MESABI Charge Air Cooler 180kw L&M Radiator Mesabi Charge Air Cooler, Part Number 120066 Quantity: 1 EA The minimum needs of the Government are for a Charge Air Cooler with the following performance characteristics: Air-to-air heat exchange radiator (Charge Air Cooler) with field replaceable tubes in the radiator core without the use of welding or brazing.

All interested parties are encouraged to contact the primary point of contact listed on this announcement for further information if necessary.
<p><strong>NOTE: JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (SOLE SOURCE). </strong></p>
<p>1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for NeuralStar Maintenance Renewal to Department-Owned NeuralStar Software on behalf of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Network Management Office (IRM/OPS/ENM).The estimated cost of this acquisition is $641,978.24 <br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: New Purchase Order for commercial items. This procurement is for sole source only. The period of performance for this is 1/1/13 - 12/31/13.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs: NeuralStar software provides a network-based, enterprise management solution that monitors and remotes manages all devices integrated into the network, isolates potential problems and catalogs recurring security events and provides streaming intelligence updates to users distributed across the network. The Department has a requirement for the following software upgrades and maintenance to Department-owned NeuralStar software:</p>
<p>Product Description Part Number<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2Parent and 13 Child Nodes)<br />- TCP Management Interface Protocol<br />- Operator Clients<br />- Web browser Operator Client<br />- NeuralStar Design Suite DoS Order Number : SAQMMA10M2267<br />DoS Req. No: 1019030385<br />Kratos Project Number: S00MANT.000.079<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2 Child Nodes)<br />- TCP Management Interface Protocol<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA10F4846<br />DoS Req. No: 1019030642<br />Kratos Project Number: S00MANT.000.080<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- NeuralStar SNMP Fault and Performance Management Pack Supporting Failover (2 Child Nodes)<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA11M1368<br />DoS Req. No: 1019130285<br />Kratos Project Number: S00MANT.000.094<br />NeuralStar Annual Maintenance Renewal<br />- SNMP Fault, Performance &amp; WWMI Management Package<br />- Operator Clients DoS Order Number : SAQMMA11M1857<br />DoS Req. No: 1019140191<br />Kratos Project Number: S00MANT.000.095</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: The required items are a software product developed by NeuralStar and currently in use by DoS. They are the sole source provider of the upgrades, bug fixes and or enhancements based on the fact that they own the software and protect their source code. No other provider has the source codes to upgrade or modify the product. This product was chosen through a competitive evaluation by the Department of State whereby several products were evaluated. It took approximately 2 years to conduct this evaluation. This would be analogous to Microsoft, where you cannot obtain upgrades or bug fixes to Windows 7 from Apple or HP the code belongs to Microsoft. As compared to NeuralStar, no other company can put into operation software upgrades or augmentation. The proprietary software code support is available only from the original software manufacturer and its authorized partners, and therefore precludes consideration of any other brand.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: A Combined Synopsis solicitation will be issued under FAR 5.2 procedures. The Combined Synopsis/Solicitation will include this Justification, and will be publicized on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer will make a fair and reasonable price determination based on previous purchases.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: No market research was conducted, as the NeuralStar software licenses currently deployed are a proprietary software product that can only be maintained with additional proprietary software code through authorized software resellers of the original manufacturer - Kratos Technology &amp; Training Solutions, Inc. (formerly Sys Technologies)</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: As this is a sole source justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been identified as the only products that will meet the Department's requirements as part of the Department's storage environment.</p>
<p>Based on the results of a RFI conducted in the Feb - Mar 2010 timeframe. Several vendors responded and several products were evaluated based on their responses. Each vendor was asked to provide a presentation based on their responses to our RFI. From these presentations IRM/OPS/ENM chose NeuralStar. The NeuralStar products satisfy the following high priority specifications: Manager of Managers, Performance and Fault, simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Reporting and Latency for the management and monitoring of the DoS enterprise networks and infrastructure. The NeuralStar product continues to demonstrate the ability to satisfy these criteria with an attractive cost-benefit package better than other vendor products that were evaluated. The NeuralStar product has demonstrated high marks on operational awareness via the event and alarm manager, superior ease of use for the end user, the ability to view alarms, nodes and devices at the user and group levels, and the ability to share that information among many users and groups in a single solution suite. It also provides tightly integrated performance metrics as well as long-term storage capacity for trend reporting. NeuralStar provides the framework for integrating with ENM's existing tools using the standardized .Net framework. In addition ENM has direct database access to the NeuralStar product allowing flexibility associated with storage, replication, backups and query access of this data.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: This Sole Source Justification will be publicized on FedBizOpps with the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong><br />The Government intends to award one or award more than one Blanket Purchase Agreement; however, the Government reserves the right not to award any BPA. The Government does not guarantee any order placements. Any resultant BPA(s) will be five (5) years in duration; however, either party may terminate the resulting BPA with 30 calendar days notice.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to establish a BPA for the performance of fine art conservation services in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the Harry S Truman Building in Washington D.C.  The art and architecture of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms is modeled after the great American interiors: Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, Benjamin Chew's Cliveden, and John MacPherson's Mount Pleasant.  These interiors were designed for the U.S. Department of State by architects Walter Macomber, Edward Vason Jones, and John Blatteau.  Today, these reception rooms and principal offices require annual and ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p>The Contractor will conduct a condition assessment of the collections at the U.S. Department of State, identifying short- and long-term conservation objectives over the five-year period (i.e. approximately 450 historic artifacts) and making best practice recommendations for care and preservation of the collections (i.e. exhibition requirements and environmental conditions).</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide a pre-assessment report to the Curator of Collections for review (i.e. statement on original workmanship of artist, present condition and underlying causes, prior restoration(s)/conservation, solubility test results, and photographic documentation).  Conservation will be preceded by test areas, the results of which will be shared with the Curatorial staff, and the resulting treatment will be conducted in layered approaches given subjective interpretation of solubility tests.</p>
<p>Treatments will address surface accumulation and yellowing varnish; common paint issues (flaking, cupping, and drying and mechanical cracks); support issues with structural supports, housing and/or frames; prior restoration(s) of moderate-to-poor quality; general and pervasive damage requiring filling and/or inpainting.  The Contractor will preserve original materials and workmanship to the fullest extent possible (i.e. dot-by-dot inpainting technique with reversible materials).</p>
<p>The Contractor advises the Curator of Collections as a technical experts drawing from multiple years of experience working with Government collections in the Washington, DC, region.  This includes a thorough working knowledge of historic artifacts through the colonial and federal periods with specific understanding of regional and revival styles where necessary.</p>

This can be found at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_212_213.html</p>
<p><br /><strong>Evaluation criteria:</strong><br />The procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 15.101-1. The acquisition evaluation will be conducted utilizing a best value -tradeoff source selection process, which seeks to select an offer with the overall best value to meet the Government's need. Best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement, in accordance with FAR 2.101.</p>
<p>The best value will be determined by comparing differences in the value of non-price features in cost to the Government. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical, non-price features than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to achieve slightly superior technical, non-price features.</p>
<p>Therefore, price/cost is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of an offeror, but the degree of importance of cost as a factor could become greater depending on the quality of the proposals for other factors evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make a selection based upon the initial proposal submissions so the offeror should submit its best terms in the initial proposal. The Government may also determine to make no award.</p>
<p>A single offeror will be selected who is deemed responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1 and whose offer provides the Government with a best value solution.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Key Personnel, and Past Performance. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Technical Capability:</strong><br />Offerors must demonstrate an understanding of the performance requirements and an ability to execute them in accordance with the Statement of Work. In evaluating technical capability, the Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work and soundness of their approach to specifically include an offeror's ability to provide the required services necessary to successfully execute the SOW requirements. In evaluating the offeror's technical capability, the Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the complete scope and complexity of performance requirements as it relates to the proposed skill mix and level of effort. This will be evaluated as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to plan for, manage, and staff the requirement.</p>
<p>Submissions for technical proposals shall not exceed ten (10) pages excluding title pages, table of contents, and graphics.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Key Personnel:</strong><br />Offerors must demonstrate that there will be knowledgeable and skilled personnel performing the required duties. Key personnel must have in-depth experience in specialized conservation with similar projects.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Past Performance:</strong> <br />Offerors must demonstrate proof of corporate past performance in work related to this requirement. The personnel must have in-depth experience in specialized conservation with similar projects. Companies must have experience handling detailed projects in historically significant settings</p>
<p><br /><strong>Price (non technical factor):</strong><br />The offeror shall provide a written price proposal. All services for each period of performance are to be labor hours with firm fixed rates. The offeror's price proposal should include labor categories, and fully burdened labor rates.</p>
<p><br />The Contracting Officer will establish call limitations in writing for individuals who are authorized to place calls. The call limit for each individual may vary.</p>
<p>The Government will notify the offeror of the names of individuals who will be authorized to place calls against any resulting BPA. The BPA will identify the names of the individuals authorized to schedule deliveries under the Agreement. Only authorized Government employees who have been specifically named by the Contracting Officer may schedule deliveries under this agreement. STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THIS STIPULATION IS IMPERATIVE.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal Submission:</strong> <br />Proposal must be submitted electronically to dermidoffpt@state.gov. The due date is Thursday, March 28 at 12PM EST. All proposals as well as inquiries should be sent electronically to:</p>
<p>Patrick T. Dermidoff<br />Contract Officer<br />U.S. Department of State<br />Dermidoffpt@state.gov<br />703-875-4679</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200050 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 334419.  The small business size standard is 500 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:

P/N: 90B46
NSN: 5999-01-HS2-5799
QTY: 100 EA
MFGCD: 3G3K6



It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), APEM Components, Inc. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that APEM Components is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  

Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to London.c.venzon@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 18 Mar 2013.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  	HQ Army Materiel Command	  <br>  	Office of Command Counsel  <br>  	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  	Ft.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Special Notice (DRAFT RFQ) for industry comment. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS MARKET RESEARCH ONLY. The Draft RFQ is posted at GSA's E-buy site under RFQ# 767161. The United States Air Force, Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG), Furnishings Commodity Council (FCC) proposes to contract in the future for Air Force wide Executive Office and Conference Furniture (formerly referred to as Casegoods and Common Area Furniture) utilizing enterprise wide strategic sourcing to standardize product offerings and to leverage the best pricing for the Air Force. The result of this evaluation will be to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to vendors who will be the ONLY mandated sources of supply for the entire Air Force, when making purchases that fall under the scope of this program. The Government intends to issue a formal Request for Quotes (RFQ) in Spring/Summer of 2013 via GSA e-Buy, in accordance with FAR 8.405.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the ESG FCC to establish a target of five (5) BPAs that will be awarded, against Government Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 71 SIN (Special Item Number) categories are SIN 711 8 Executive Office Furniture and SIN 711 9 Executive Conference Room Furniture, Coordinated Tables, Case Pieces and Accessories. If determined to be in the Government's best interest, the Air Force reserves the right to award more or less BPAs. BPAs will be awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-3(a). All resulting BPAs will contain agreements on prices for products at a not-to-exceed (NTE) amount and at the Call/order level, prices will become firm fixed prices.</p>
<p>This announcement is restricted to small businesses under NAICS code 337211. The planned period of performance for the BPAs will include a base period of one (1) year and four (4) one (1) year ordering periods. It is anticipated that the BPAs will be awarded not earlier than October 2013. Annual reviews of the success of the BPA as well as price reasonableness will be conducted prior to the end of each ordering period. The estimated value of the Air Force's Executive Office and Conference Furniture needs is approximately $78M. The Government does not guarantee any percentage of the $78M to any one particular contractor. BPA holders will honor their NTE pricing (or better) and their discount percentage and then each local base will compete their requirements amongst the BPA holders for their individual Executive Office and Conference Furniture needs. The discount percentage is calculated and explained in Attachment 6. It provides a framework for bases to buy GSA-listed Executive Office and Conference Furniture furniture items off of proposed product lines that are not already included in the Furniture Pricing Matrix (Attachment 6).</p>
<p>To be eligible for a BPA award, an Offeror must (1) be a current GSA Schedule 71 small business schedule holder, (2) meet all specifications listed in the Requirements Attachment 5a, and (3) have all items listed in the Furniture Pricing Matrix Attachment 6 on their schedule. No open market items will be allowed. Each contractor must also have D-U-N-S number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM Internet site at https://www.sam.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&amp;B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Contractors are also required to complete the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) found in the SAM website.</p>
<p>The Government intends to conduct a Best Value Evaluation in accordance with FAR 8. Furthermore, FAR Part 15, with its reference to Source Selection, will not be employed. <br />The purpose of posting this DRAFT RFQ is to elicit feedback from Industry in order to accomplish the following: <br />1. Ensure what we are asking for is clear<br />2. Ensure industry can provide what we are asking for<br />3. Ensure industry understands the evaluation process<br />4. Determine if the Air Force has omitted any details that prevent Industry's ability to participate</p>
<p>This is a DRAFT RFQ requesting feedback to be utilized to make the FINAL RFQ a better product.</p>

<p>Capabilities Briefings</p>
<p>Manufacturers and Dealers may also request the opportunity to provide a capabilities briefing to the Enterprise Sourcing Group's (ESG) Furnishings Commodities Council (FCC) after the Draft Request for Quotation (RFQ) is released. Manufacturers and Dealers may request the opportunity to provide an in-person or telephone capabilities brief to the Executive Office and Conference Furniture program team. This session will be strictly limited to two hours in duration, to promote consistency/fairness for all parties. The purpose of these capability briefings is to allow Manufacturers and Dealers the opportunities to not only discuss their individual capabilities, but to directly address any issues or concerns that they may have with the Draft RFQ and the subsequent release of the final RFQ. Briefings will be scheduled for March 18-22 (after draft RFQ release). The agenda for this briefing is provided below. Please note the structured nature of the agenda and refrain from providing promotional material.</p>
<p>Capabilities Briefing Agenda:</p>
<p>1. Please confirm your ability to meet the Executive Office and Conference Furniture requirements contained in Attachment 5a of the draft RFQ. Discuss any requirements you are unable to meet and/or whether or not you will be able to meet the requirements by the time the final RFQ is released.</p>
<p>2. Confirm that you have at least two GSA-listed product lines with salient characteristics for each style proposed (traditional, transitional, and contemporary) that meet 100% of the requirements listed in Attachment 5a. More specifically, if you have two separate product lines, we are looking for two product lines that individually meet 100% of the requirements of RFQ Attachment 5a. If your product is unable to meet 100% of the requirements, please identify the specific requirement(s) that the product does not meet.</p>
<p>3. Provide feedback regarding the pricing methodology we are proposing (see Attachment 6). Discuss any issues you see with the proposed calculation of an average weighted discount for non-typical products and accessories.</p>
<p>4. Discuss the RFQ response time of 30 days. Specifically, if the FCC gave you more time how would you use it, how would it affect the quality of the proposal, and how would it benefit the government?</p>
<p>5. Discuss any experience you have with GSA schedule 71, and your concerns with using GSA E-Buy as the primary acquisition vehicle.</p>
<p>6. Please discuss whether price discounts of 10% are realistic based upon total historical Air Force Executive Office and Conference Furniture spend.</p>
<p>7. Please address questions or concerns with Attachment 7 - Reporting Instructions, and Reporting Matrix.</p>
<p>8. Question and Answer session. This Q&amp;A session will be limited to no more than 15 minutes and any questions/answers will be posted for other parties to review. Note that any proprietary information will not be disclosed in any posting.</p>
<p>If you decide to participate, please send an e-mail confirming your desire to meet, along with any scheduling preferences, to the name and address at the end of this request. We will determine the final schedule and provide a response back to your firm. The deadline for requests to provide capabilities briefings will be 7 days after posting the draft RFP on GSA E-buy (March 15). Responses should be sent to SrA Michael Lucero at affcceocf@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>As of 11 March 2013, Response Date has been modified FROM: 11 March 2013 TO: 29 March 2013.  <br>  <br> The Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM SW) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07860-5000, on behalf of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5422, is assessing handgun technologies as well as production capacity of the US small arms industrial base.  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI).  <br>    <br>  To facilitate the assessment, the following information is requested:  <br>    <br>  1. Performance Improvement: Request information on potential improvements in handgun performance in the areas of accuracy and dispersion out to 50m, terminal performance, modularity, reliability and durability in all environments.  <br>    <br>  *  The handgun and ammunition combination should, at a range of 50 meters, have a 90% or better probability of hit on a 4 inch circle when fired from a test fixture.  It must maintain this throughout the life of the system. Systems are encouraged to utilize ergonomic and design improvements to minimize the effects of greater recoil energies, reducing the degradation of shooter-in-the-loop dispersion thereby improving the probability of hit.  <br>    <br>  *  Modularity includes but is not limited to compatibility with accessory items to include tactical lights, lasers and sound suppressors. There is specific interest in designs that would be adaptable and/or adjustable to provide enhanced ergonomics that ensure 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male military personnel access to controls, such as the safety, magazine release, slide release and all other applicable controls. There is also interest in designs that offer these enhanced ergonomics while providing full ambidextrous controls.   <br>    <br>  *  The handgun ammunition's terminal ballistics will be evaluated at ranges of 0-50m, over 0-14 inches of ballistic gelatin, to determine whether it provides more lethality when compared to the current U.S. Military M882 ammunition fired from the M9.  Ammunition evaluated will meet international law of war conventions that bound current general purpose military ammunition. The Pistol evaluated must be capable of chamber pressures equal to or greater than SAAMI specification for the given cartridge, with prolonged reliability equal to or greater than the current M9.  However, the ability to accommodate higher chamber pressures in excess of 20% over SAAMI spec without degradation of reliability is of specific interest.  <br>    <br>  *  Reliability and Durability includes but is not limited to Mean Rounds between Stoppage (MRBS), Mean Rounds Between Failure (MRBF) and Service Life.  There is specific interest in designs with ratings of at least 2,000 rounds MRBS, 10,000 rounds MRBF and 35,000 round Service Life.   <br>    <br>  2. Production capacity estimates.  Request information on minimum and maximum monthly production rates for a military handgun and associated ammunition as well as the lead times to achieve these production rates. This estimate should consider a US based production facility by the third year of deliveries. This capacity should be above and beyond any current production orders or current sales. If new facilities are planned or required, so state.  A list of State and Federal agencies, as well as foreign governments, that have adopted the handgun should also be included.  <br>    <br>  3. Detailed descriptions of proposed handguns to include pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the principles as well as general and specific capabilities behind the submissions.  Physical dimensions, weight and safety features should be included.   <br>    <br>  4. Summarized and detailed test data from any certified test facility that addresses improvements in the areas proposed. Test operating procedures utilized and independent evaluations are also solicited.  <br>    <br>  5. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate. Request estimated pricing for the submission based on the following quantities:  250,000 to 550,000 handguns.  <br>    <br>    <br>  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government use of such information. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its Acquisition Strategy, Performance Work Statement and Performance Specification.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  <br>    <br>  SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  <br>  Interested offerors should submit the information annotated above, in hard copy, by March 11, 2013 to: Army Contracting Command, Acquisition Center, ACC-NJ-SW, Bldg 9, Attn: Gloria Thoguluva, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07805.

<DESC>Thank you in advance for taking the time to assist us in gathering this information!  <br>    <br>  This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the services stated herein.  All business, large and small business, to include certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), certified 8(a), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Economically Disadvantage Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Small Disadvantage Business (SDB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice by completing and submitting the attached Sources Sought Questionnaire to the Government.  You are advised that providing responses to the questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for future solicitation.  An important outcome of this research is the possibility of setting aside this acquisition for exclusive competitive participation within a specific Small Business Administration (SBA) program in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.201(a).    <br>     <br>  The anticipated period of performance for the aforementioned requirement is 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2014 with four one-year option periods.  <br>    <br>  Description of services.  Joint Base Lewis-McChord is one of the largest and most modern military reservations in the United States, which includes Yakima Training Center (YTC), and is the premier military installation in the Northwest.  YTC has the best collective range in the Northwest.  YTC is an approximately 323,000 acre military reservation located in Yakima and Kittitas Counties in central Washington, approximately seven (7) miles north of the city of Yakima, Washington.  YTC is bounded on the north by Highway I-90; on the east by the Columbia River; Highway I-82 forms most of the western boundary; and the southern boundary is located approximately 6 Kilometers south of Yakima ridge.  YTC lies in a transitional zone between the Cascade Mountains and the Columbia Plateau.  The climate of the region surrounding YTC is characterized by hot, dry summers, and cold, dry-to-moist winters.  The average precipitation ranges from four (4) to six (6) inches per year.  Precipitation falls mainly during fall and spring.  Access to the Range and range operations may be hampered by snowfall and drifting snow.  Most of the land on YTC ranges from gently rolling to rugged terrain.  YTC is used primarily as a training area for large-scale military maneuvers, particularly those involving heavy wheeled and tracked vehicles (tanks and armored personnel carriers), and for training in use of large, long-range weapons.  Active Army, U.S. Army Reserves (USAR), National Guard (NG), Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, and Foreign Military Forces under a Standard of Forces Agreement that includes Canada and Japan in carrying out various military activities will utilize the Multi-Purpose Training Range (MPTR).  It is estimated that the MPTR, located in the northern section of YTC, will normally be utilized 248 days per year, equivalent to 380 eight (8)-hour man-days.     <br>    <br>  Thus, the purpose requirement is to operate and maintain the MPTR (i.e., Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC)), Range 1487A, and provide supplemental target and repair support to the Digital Range at Yakima Training Center (YTC).  This effort is to provide training support to enhance the Training Units' abilities to accomplish missions successfully and support mobilization in accordance with Forces Command (FORSCOM) Regulation 350-2.  <br>    <br>  Performance shall include:  <br>    <br>  1.	Operation and maintenance of Enhances Remote Equipment Target System (ERETS) equipment  <br>    <br>  2.	Operation and maintenance of facilities  <br>    <br>  3.	Grounds and tank trail maintenance  <br>    <br>  4.	Operational Readiness: In order for the MPRC ranges to fulfill their training missions they must have a minimum number of targets up and in a completely functional mode.  This minimum number of targets will be known as the  quote mark operational readiness level quote mark  (ORL) and will be verified each day by a range test report.  The ORL for each of the MPRC ranges shall be 90% of all targets minus all targets for which Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) is being accomplished at that time.   <br>    <br>  5.	All administrative duties to include material requisitioning, quality control, development and maintenance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), records, files, and libraries of documents to include Federal, State, and Local regulations, codes, laws, technical manuals, and manufacturers' instructions and recommendations, which are necessary and related to the functions being performed, and shall compile historical data, prepare required reports.    <br>    <br>  Disclaimer.  This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services.  Responses to this Sources Sought shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  MICC JBLM will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this Sources Sought.  The responder must clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary.  All information received in response to this Sources Sought that is marked  quote mark Proprietary quote mark  will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this Sources Sought will not be returned.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of the notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.   <br>      <br>   The government is seeking sources/vendors/companies that are capable to provide transportation to and permanent disposal of non-NRC regulated materials at appropriately licensed and/or permitted disposal facility(ies).  Such materials do not require disposal in accordance with 10 CFR 61 or 10 CFR 40, Appendix A and may include:  Low Activity Radioactive Waste (LARW), Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (TENORM), Low Activity Mixed Waste (LAMW), and TENORM Mixed Waste (TENORM/MW).     <br>      <br>   Materials for disposal consist of soil and/or debris and are typically in volumes ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cubic yards.  The source(s) of these materials may include a variety of project sites across the United States including Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites, Superfund sites, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites, and other sites where the Army Corps of Engineers has cleanup execution authority.   <br>      <br>   Transportation methods typically include use of bulk containers and transport via truck, rail, or a combination of truck and rail.  Empty bulk containers are transported to the project site and are loaded by the government (or designee) for transport to the disposal facility.  Trans-loading of materials containerized in appropriate DOT packages during transport to the disposal facility (e.g., transfer of closed intermodal containers from truck to rail) is generally acceptable.  Trans-loading of loose materials from one DOT package to another (e.g., transferring material from and end dump truck to a rail gondola) is sometimes acceptable and is subject to government review and approval prior to implementation.  During such review consideration is given for permits /licenses and physical/engineering controls proposed or in place to minimize or eliminate potential for spills or other loss of material.   <br>      <br>   This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources and services pursuant to FAR Part 10.  This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this Sources Sought Notice.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.    <br>      <br>   Interested sources shall submit electronically a narrative demonstrating their experience in these areas and any small business class certifications to LaShura.M.Johnson-Hidalgo@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00PM EST on 29 March 2013.  The narrative shall not exceed 5 pages (11 font minimum).  Tables, charts, graphs, etc., will count towards the 5 page count total (smaller font is allowed for these items, but the text must be legible).  Please make sure your business classification is identified on the first page of your response.  All data received in response to this Sources Sought Notice marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government.    <br>      <br>   No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.   <br>

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 01 - 405 - White River Jct, VT intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 01 - 405 - White River Jct, VT is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a justification and approval that provides notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-08-D-0005, Packing and Crating Services, for a period of two (2) months. The current contract expires 31 Mar 2013 and the services need to continue to ensure uninterruption until the new contract under solicitation FA4610-12-R-0014 is awarded. The period of performance for this extension will be from 01 Apr 2013 through 01 May 2013 for two (2) months and extend longer if required. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This option exercise will be at the current rate specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This option exercise will further allow for the current procurement under FA4610-12-R-0014 to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential contractor. Andersen Van &amp; Storage Inc. is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8 within 10 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise. A determination by the Government to exercise the aforementioned option clause and not compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to exercise the option. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to nancy.perez@us.af.mil and sean.kennedy@us.af.mil.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Acquisition Service-Frederick (AS-F) for Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service (VR&E).

2.  Nature/Description of Action being Approved.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Standard Communications, Inc (a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business) for the procurement of business process reengineering support services. 

3.  Description of Supplies/ Services Required to Meet the Agency's Need (including estimated value).

This requirement is to continue the work begun during the VR&E Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Services Contract.  The BPR Services Contract is working toward improving VR&E's use of automation, provision of services, and personnel performance.  All deliverables associated with this task order will be Section 508 (part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998) compliant.  This requirement will allow for the following:

A.	Expansion of the staffing model to include beta testing and familiarization, new requirements, implementation of new requirements, training, and a user guide;
B.	Preparation and development of rehabilitated and discontinued Veterans post-outcome questionnaires; implementation strategy/approach recommendations that will result in electronic and paper based questionnaires being automatically sent to Veterans at the six and twelve month milestone dates as well as recommendations for a system for managing the responses that are returned (via electronic and paper submissions) from the Veterans' completed questionnaires and following up with Veterans, who have not completed the questionnaires; recommendations for electronic questionnaire packages and providing the associated general budgetary requirements/rough cost estimates; and recommendations for types of report, analysis, and the process for tracking and report development at the national, regional office, and counselor levels.
C.	Provision of a Contractor's Project Management Plan (PMP) and project management support to ensure the timely successful completion of this TO and its associated tasks and deliverables.
The Contractor shall provide continuation of services that are critical to VBA's Business Transformation and ensure VR&E Service's required tasks align with the core area requirements of BPR.  The required tasks are a continuation of BPR improvements, and implementation supports VBA's Business Transformation.  The major task areas are as follows:

A.	Staffing Model and Enhancements;
B.	Case Management Post-Outcome Rehabilitated and Discontinued Veterans Questionnaires and Follow-Up;
C.	Contractor's PMP and Project Management Support.
VA desires to meet the following objectives for implementing the continuation of BPR improvements in support of VBA's Business Transformation efforts.  All deliverables associated with the objectives for implementing the continuation of BPR improvements will be Section 508 compliant.  
The proposed total contract cost is estimated to be $818,011.65.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.
The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5. The applicable statute is PL 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program (codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128).

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Standard Communications, Inc. (SCI) is a VA Certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  SCI's capabilities include "total life cycle" program management services; telecommunications and infrastructure services (strategy, design, engineering, acquisition, implementation, operations, and maintenance; inside/outside cable plant design and installation as well as perimeter security solutions; and telephony expertise); information technology services (functional expertise in systems development, engineering, document management - imaging/digitalization, and implementation through every phase of the information technology life cycle); data transmission circuits services; and program management and contract administration support services. 

VA has been a major customer of SCI.  In 2004 - 2005, SCI installed private business exchanges (PBXs), complex communications/IT/training projects, at VA Medical Centers in Manchester, NH; Boston, West Roxbury, Brockton, MA and the Out Patient Clinics (OPCs) in Lowell and Worchester, MA.  From 2005 - 2006, a similar project was done for the VA at the VAMCs in Battle Creek, Saginaw, and Ann Arbor and at the OPC in Grand Rapids and ten other sites in Michigan.  These new communications facilities were then integrated with the existing VAMCs at Indianapolis, Ft. Wayne, and Marion, IN; Detroit, MI; and Danville, IL.  Additionally, starting from 2006, SCI was awarded the Veterans Technology Services (VETS) government-wide acquisition contracts (GWAC) for both functional areas: Systems Operations and Maintenance and Information Systems Engineering.  Further, SCI had communications projects at the VAMC in Northampton, MA; Sheridan, WY; Murfreesboro, TN; Salisbury, NC, and Richmond, VA in 2007 - 2008.  Also, in 2007, SCI provided help desk and other support services to the VAMCs and OPCs in Kansas and Missouri.  In 2009, SCI assisted the VA's Austin Finance Center with the installation of the first NEC SV8500 100% Voice over Internet Protocol.  More specifically to VR&E Service, SCI assisted with the CWINRS Project Office in Washington, DC.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.

Not applicable per VAAR 819.7007(b). A notice of intent will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities System.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on sources such as comparison of other contracts' for same or similar services, the contractor's public price list, GSA price lists, and other market research. 

8.  Description of Market Survey.

Not required per VAAR 819.7007(b). Market research was conducted using VetBiz.gov. Accord Federal Services, LLC is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  It is registered and verified in VetBiz.gov as a SDVOSB with the NAICS code for this requirement.

9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:

SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if:

(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;

(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and

(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

It is anticipated that this procurement will meet all of these conditions.

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

	Standard Communications, Inc
	5402 Leeds Manor Rd.
Hume, VA 22639-1758
	(SDVOSB)

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Market research will be conducted at that time to determine if a more cost effective/ efficient system would better meet the evolving needs to the organization.
