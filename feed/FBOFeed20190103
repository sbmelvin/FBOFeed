The vendor will provide a customer portal via a graphic user interface or comparable.  The vendor is responsible for all updates and login information for the customer.  Options within the portal will include ordering functions, search functions by order number or patient name, delivery status for the order and other typical functions found in the medical supply ordering industry.  This will be a base plus 1 option year contract and could lead to larger VISN level contract based on performance of the system.  The vendor is responsible for providing the framework for the portal at the time of submission of their proposal.   The RFP will be published later following the response to this RFI.  

Responses are to be sent to harry.gramboiii@va.gov no later than 1400, Jan 18, 2019.

<DESC><p>DLA Aviation has a recurring need to acquire a variety of General Electric (GE) consumables and depot level repairables in support of DOD customers world-wide supporting the LM2500 engine. DLA manages over 2,000 NIINs coded to the LM2500. These items are currently supported primarily through tactical buys against a GE Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). The BOA, used by DOD, US Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security, was established by DLA Aviation in December 2016 and expires in December 2021.<br />&nbsp;<br />DLA Aviation intends to award all requirements for 494 sole source GE items that are received between now and October 31, 2019. The list of items is attached to this notice. Awards will be made by the issuance of orders against BOA SPE4A1-17-G-0013 (subsumable to BOA SPE4A1-17-G-0008). The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to award to only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) or 6.302-1. No formal solicitations will be issued for orders.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements for these items or submit future proposals for these requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete requirements for these items based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurements to satisfy requirements for these items.</p>
<p>If any non-OEM source, including surplus dealers, is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD Procurement Note C04 "Unused Former Government Surplus Property (DEC 2016)" (formerly DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material), or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (michael.massello@sba.gov). Point of contact for this action is the Contracting Officer, Kim Banks-Jackson, at kim.banks-jackson@dla.mil.</p>

<p>The purpose of this RFP, entitled "RNCP-Wide Dosimetry Guidance &amp; Monitoring of Sources and Irradiation Protocols (CLINICAL TRIALS NOT ALLOWED)," is to define a program-led strategy for respondents who can provide services, facilities, expertise and capabilities to develop a centralized dosimetry harmonization effort that fits the resources and circumstances of projects across the funded RNCP portfolio. The respondent will have preliminary data demonstrating consistent and accurate dosimetry exposures within a clearly defined radiation exposure system that is used for non-clinical radiation animal (and in vitro) studies in more than one animal species (e.g. mouse and NHP).</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about January 22, 2019 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA White River Junction Healthcare System, has a requirement for a senior mental health clinician who is an expert in both Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for the purposes of performing fidelity assessments; these services are needed for research purposes.  A fixed price contract for up to 5 years is anticipated and shall be awarded. It is the Government s belief that only a certain individual who is a nationally recognized expert in both Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy that has past collaborative experience on the research project will meet the Government s needs.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">FUNCTION: At the rear of the fuselage of most aircraft one finds a horizontal stabilizer and an elevator. The stabilizer is a fixed wing section whose job is to provide stability for the aircraft, to keep it flying straight. The horizontal stabilizer prevents up-and-down, or pitching, motion of the aircraft nose. The elevator is the small moving section at the rear of the stabilizer that is attached to the fixed sections by hinges. Because the elevator moves, it varies the amount of force generated by the tail surface and is used to generate and control the pitching motion of the aircraft. There is an elevator attached to each side of the fuselage. The elevators work in pairs; when the right elevator goes up, the left elevator also goes up. This slide shows what happens when the pilot deflects the elevator. The elevator is used to control the position of the nose of the aircraft and the angle of attack of the wing. Changing the inclination of the wing to the local flight path changes the amount of lift which the wing generates. This, in turn, causes the aircraft to climb or dive. During takeoff the elevators are used to bring the nose of the aircraft up to begin the climb out. During a banked turn, elevator inputs can increase the lift and cause a tighter turn. That is why elevator performance is so important for fighter aircraft.</span></p>

Raster video and stroke video are received from other aircraft subsystems, amplified and routed to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display. The CRT image is projected through a lens system, onto a mirror and up to a combiner glass, creating a display in the pilot's forward field-of-view. An automatic brightness control (ABC) senses ambient light levels and automatically adjusts display intensity for comfortable viewing. A Built-in Test (BIT) function provides a quick operational check of all subassemblies and can be used as a maintenance aid. Display controls and operation mode switches are mounted on the front of the HUD. A TV camera head is mounted on top of the chassis and presents a view through the windscreen. The top cover contains a desiccant access door and a retractable lifting handle. The HUD operates within its design limits and performs its mission by displaying the above designated information in a reliable manner.</span></p>

Raster video and stroke video are received from other aircraft subsystems, amplified and routed to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display. The CRT image is projected through a lens system, onto a mirror and up to a combiner glass, creating a display in the pilot's forward field-of-view. An automatic brightness control (ABC) senses ambient light levels and automatically adjusts display intensity for comfortable viewing. A Built-in Test (BIT) function provides a quick operational check of all subassemblies and can be used as a maintenance aid. Display controls and operation mode switches are mounted on the front of the HUD. A TV camera head is mounted on top of the chassis and presents a view through the windscreen. The top cover contains a desiccant access door and a retractable lifting handle. The HUD operates within its design limits and performs its mission by displaying the above designated information in a reliable manner.</span></p>

Raster video and stroke video are received from other aircraft subsystems, amplified and routed to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display. The CRT image is projected through a lens system, onto a mirror and up to a combiner glass, creating a display in the pilot's forward field-of-view. An automatic brightness control (ABC) senses ambient light levels and automatically adjusts display intensity for comfortable viewing. A Built-in Test (BIT) function provides a quick operational check of all subassemblies and can be used as a maintenance aid. Display controls and operation mode switches are mounted on the front of the HUD. A TV camera head is mounted on top of the chassis and presents a view through the windscreen. The top cover contains a desiccant access door and a retractable lifting handle. The HUD operates within its design limits and performs its mission by displaying the above designated information in a reliable manner.</span></p>

Of specific interest to ARDEC is the development of materials and manufacturing techniques that allow for new levels of functionality, affordability and performance for Munitions &amp; Armament Systems. <br />Solutions are needed for armaments and ammunition support systems/components which includes a need for materials and processing techniques that allow for the manufacturing of three-dimensional functional devices that can withstand high-g (acceleration) loadings. These systems will require the use of 5-axis hybrid manufacturing equipment with the ability to print dielectric and conductive electronic materials along with structural materials, as well as have the ability to pick-and-place integrated circuits and other components, and machine or polish finished surfaces. Complex, multi-material / multi-technology manufacturing techniques and associated software packages that allow for converting three-dimensional design into machine code for the manufacturing processes is of need. There is also solutions and availability needed for materials that are designed for this type of processing in conjunction with the rigors of high-g loading and survive harsh environments for Army applications.

<DESC><p>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><br />North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing - and the associated business size standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p><br />Background Information: <br />The Cerebral Microcirculation Section (CMS) of the Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging (LFMI), in the Intramural Rearch Division at the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS) is focused on understanding how brain cells communicate with blood vessels to ensure that the brain tissue is continuously supplied with adequate amounts of blood. For this, research in CMS employs small animal models, including rodents and small primates, and a state-of-the-art 7T small animal MRI system that allows the acquisition of anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain of the animals. In 2009, the 7T MRI system was fitted with a quadrature RF coil from Resonance Research, Inc. The RF coil is the device that produces radio-frequency pulses that are able to excite the sample inside the magnet, generating the signal that is detected so that MR images can be obtained. This RF coil, still in use, is at the end of its useful life. It has started to fail multiple times over the past year, causing cancellation of experiments so that the RF coil can be repaired. These repairs are becoming increasingly more difficult to make, because the components inside the RF coil need to be desoldered and resoldered, a process that introduces wear of the copper tracks in the RF coil. As a consequence, it is becoming more and more difficult and time-consuming to repair the existing RF coil, and a replacement coil needs to be acquired to allow continued operation of the 7T MRI system. The objective of this acquisition is to procure two new volume RF quadrature coils operating at 300 MHz.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition:</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure two (2) new RF coils. These components will modernize CMS 7T small animal MRI system and allow state-of-the-art imaging of small primates and rodents, in support of the research goals of CMS and overall mission in neurological research at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements (Scope of Work): <br />The contractor shall be able to provide Quadrature Radio-Frequency (RF) Coils for MRI Experiments with Small Animals with the following specifications:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this project lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources.
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The project is to perform maintenance dredging and breakwater repairs at Aurora and Harris Harbors in Juneau, Alaska. The work consists of pre- and post-dredge surveys, maintenance dredging and in-water disposal of an estimated 25,000 cubic yards of dredge material from Aurora and Harris Harbors. Project depth is -12 feet mean lower low water (MLLW) and the shoaled material generally consists of silty sand with gravel. The in-water placement site is in Gastineau Channel about 3 miles from Aurora and Harris Harbors, near Douglas Harbor. The work period for the in-water maintenance dredging is anticipated to be 1 November 2019 through 28 February 2020.</p>
<p>This project also includes replacement of a wave barrier on the main breakwater at Aurora Harbor and repairs to the breakwater of Harris Harbor. The Aurora Harbor wave barrier is a wood and steel structure approximately 1500 feet in length on a detached breakwater. The work consists of removing the remains of the existing steel pile and timber wall. Piles will either be pulled with a vibratory pile hammer or cut off at the bottom of the existing armor stone layer. A new wave barrier wall of similar construction will be built with approximately 250 H-piles driven about 24 feet to elevation -12 feet MLLW and the placement of creosote treated timbers in between the piles. The Harris Harbor breakwater is 1540 feet long and has suffered the loss of armor stone, primarily near the nose. A new two-layer system of B-rock and armor rock (A-rock) will be placed to repair voids in armor stone coverage. The work period for the wave barrier and breakwater repairs is also anticipated to be 1 November 2019 through 28 February 2020.</p>
<p>The Contractor is to furnish all labor, equipment, supplies, materials, supervision, and other items/services necessary to accomplish the work. The Contractor shall comply with commercial and industry standards as well as all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and procedures. The estimated magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The type of contract shall be firm-fixed price. Construction wage rates (formerly Davis Bacon Act wage rates) shall apply. The estimated award date of this contract is August 2019. This procurement is subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Heavy and Other Civil Construction, and the related size standard is $36.5 Million.</p>
<p>Interested firms are encouraged to submit a capabilities package (not exceeding 5 pages) demonstrating the ability to perform the work listed above. Packages should include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, DUNS number and business size under NAICS 237990.</p>
<p>(2) If small business, identify type of small business (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Woman Owned, etc.).</p>
<p>(3) Demonstration of the firm's experience as a prime contractor on projects of similar size, type and complexity within the past ten years. List actual projects completed and include project title, location and a brief description of the project including dollar amount and work that was self-performed.</p>
<p>(4) A listing of floating plant and mechanical equipment, including age and size, that may be used on this project.</p>
<p>(5) The firm's single project bonding limit.</p>
<p>(6) The firm's intent to propose on this project as a prime contractor.</p>
<p>Responsible sources demonstrating relevant experience and the capabilities to perform the work will be considered. The System for Award Management (SAM), as required per FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, will apply to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on SAM registration can be found at www.sam.gov</p>

<p>This is a combined Sole Source Synopsis / Solicitation published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Innovation Light-Way Pharmacy Will Call System at the Kittyhawk Pharmacy on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. See Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The Government requires an upgrade for a Pharmacy Will Call System at the Kittyhawk Pharmacy at WPAFB. The upgrade will increase patient safety, save space/time and money. The Will Call System will reduce the time it takes to find lost/misfiled or misplaced prescriptions. The Will Call System will alert patients via text/phone that they have a refill to be picked up. Currently the Kittyhawk Pharmacy is using brown bags with patient's first initial of last name/last 4 of SSN to file prescriptions. The proposed sole source is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339112: Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing.

The Will Call system must be installed on the pre-existing Innovation hardware. Third-party software is not allowed on the Innovation workstations. Additional workstations are not authorized in the Kittyhawk Pharmacy at this time.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government, if received by Tuesday, 8 January 2019, 02:00 P.M. EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Improvement over present cold mill manufacturing capabilities enabled by the cold mill enhancements should be detailed, to include plate capacity, plate recovery, plate quality, reduction in manufacturing lead times, costs, and inventories. Determination of the cost and schedule benefit, if any, to the US Government for making these investments is required, along with analysis of any reduction and/or avoidance in risk regarding cost and schedule in order to deliver armor plate.<br /><br />The CIR for Cold Rolled Aluminum will be communicated to the Cornerstone consortium and companies with pending applications via email.

<CONTACT>Mr. Dennis Burns, MMESO South Data Analyst, Phone 210-536-6074, Email daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil - Mr. David V. Sheaffer, MMESO South Team Leader, Phone 210-536-6075, Email david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1811-88_Nasopharyngeal_Airways_Non-Adjustable are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1801-50_Nasopharyngeal_Airways_Non-Adjustable. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 19 Feb 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1811-88_Nasopharyngeal_Airways_Non-Adjustable, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $456,124 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1811-88_Nasopharyngeal_Airways_Non-Adjustable who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />5.1 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 24FR PVC STERILE / 8,737 /<br />5.2 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 26FR PVC STERILE / 50,151 /<br />5.3 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 28FR PVC STERILE / 97,892 /<br />5.4 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 30FR PVC STERILE / 22,752 /<br />5.5 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 32FR PVC STERILE / 17,500 /<br />5.6 NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS NON-ADJUSTABLE 34FR PVC STERILE / 6,100 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary. <br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO South Data Analyst, Mr. Dennis Burns, 210-536-6074, Daniel.d.burns8.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Gauze Roll. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Gauze Roll products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Gauze Roll in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Gauze Roll will be established approximately April 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Gauze Roll. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Gauze Roll.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gauze Roll. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $131,603. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($131,603) of the total volume in sales ($131,603). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code _____________ assigned to contract number ______________________________.</p>
<p>[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].</p>
<p>52.222-36 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES (JUL 2014)</p>
<p>(a) Equal opportunity clause. The Contractor shall abide by the requirements of the equal opportunity clause at 41 CFR 60.741.5(a), as of March 24, 2014.

<p>(b) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the terms of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order in excess of $15,000 unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.

If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>I. OVERVIEW: This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items," as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued. Submit offers on RML-RFQ-1943775.
<p>This solicitation is a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-101 effective October 26, 2018. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 517311 Wired Telecommunications Carriers with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a total small business set aside. The Government anticipates making a single award Firm Fixed Price purchase order for a base 12-month period and four 12-month options.</p>
<p>II. STATEMENT OF NEED: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) requires renewal of 10GB optical wave transport service for the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana to a telecom crossroads in Chicago, Illinois that ultimately connects to NIAID's leased space within an Ashburn, Virginia collocation site. The line supports RML's access to NIAID's centralized business and scientific functions, such as genomic sequencing services, to NIAID laboratories located in Maryland. The RML generates terabytes of data that must be transmitted back to NIAID research and backup facilities in Maryland and the 10GB high speed connectivity is required to do so. The Contractor shall receive the optical wave and maintain the 10Gbps fiber optic network transport route as provided in the attached Statement of Work (SOW). Service delivery to the termination points shall be via 10GB ethernet over dark fiber. The Contractor is required to provide service to run from the Ashburn facility ingress point to NIAID's leased spaced within the facility.</p>
<p>III. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Base Period: January 27, 2019 - January 26, 2020<br />Option Year 1: January 27, 2020 - January 26, 2021<br />Option Year 2: January 27, 2021 - January 26, 2022<br />Option Year 3: January 27, 2022 - January 26, 2023<br />Option Year 4: January 27, 2023 - January 26, 2024</p>
<p>IV. INSTRUCTIONS: The government requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing the requirement as outlined in the SOW. The Government may evaluate only those quotes that fully meet the requirements as outlined in the SOW and respond to the solicitation instructions and requirements. Failure to furnish a full and complete quote as instructed may result in the Offeror's response being considered non-responsive and will therefore be eliminated from further consideration and award.</p>
<p>Quote shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Tamara McDermott, at tamara.mcdermott@nih.gov on or before Monday, January 14, 2019 5:00 pm EST. All or part of the successful offeror's quote may be incorporated in any contract resulting from this solicitation. The successful offeror's quote may be incorporated by reference. Reference Solicitation ID: RFQ-RML-1943775 on your quote.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. [Note: Lack of registration in the SAM will make an offeror ineligible for award].</p>
<p>V. EVALUATION: NIAID will evaluate all quotes to determine the best value to the government. NIAID will make a Best Value Determination based on the capability of each offeror's quote to provide the requirement as outlined in the SOW, past performance, and reasonable price. Non-price factors, when combined, are equal in importance to price. "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Best value evaluation is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the government of the offers that provides the optimal results to the government.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF OPTIONS<br />In accordance with FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price of the base requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>VI. DISCUSSIONS: The Government intends to award without discussions but reserves the right to conduct discussions should it be deemed in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>VII. SPECIAL NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />Offerors are advised that the Government may share your information with non-government personnel who are assisting with the evaluation of quotes. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. By submitting your offer, you will be consenting to disclosure of your offer to non-government personnel for purposes of evaluation.</p>
<p>VIII. QUESTIONS: If you have questions regarding this requirement, please submit inquires immediately, but no later than Tuesday, January 8, 2019 5:00 PM EST, via email to the Contract Specialist, Tamara McDermott, at tamara.mcdermott@nih.gov. The Government will issue an amendment to the RFQ responding to questions, if needed.</p>

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.

(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<BR><BR>a) This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C chapter 71, Contract Disputes.

(c) Claim, as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.<BR><BR>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.

Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract
award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and
within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest
decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To
be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR
33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest
Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent
to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the
contracting officer for resolution.

If MCC decides to extend the submission deadline, MCC will amend this RFQ within 5 business days from the reopening date. Unless this RFQ is amended, interested offerors shall assume that the questions and the quote submissions deadlines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The interested offerors are responsible for staying updated on the current US Government furlough/shutdown status and submit your quotes timely. Please read the US news and https://www.opm.gov/ regarding furlough/shutdown information.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Amendment 2:	The purpose of Amendment 2 is to extend the submission deadline. The quotes are now due by 5:00PM ET on 21 February 2019 (Thursday). The clarification regarding the US Federal Government furlough still applies. Please refer to the Amendment 1 for detail.</p>
<p>All changes are highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>This position is located in the Human and Community Development Unit (HCD), Sector Operations Division, within the Department of Compact Operations (DCO). DCO is responsible for developing and implementing MCC's compact programs. The department ensures that MCC compacts are designed and implemented in compliance with agency standards for procurement, financial management, environmental and social performance, and gender integration.</p>
<p>Within DCO, the Sector Operations Division is responsible for the development and oversight of MCC's agriculture, land, and human and community development investments, procurement and fiscal accountability oversight of compact programs, gender integration, and contracts support to the Department of Compact Operations.</p>
<p>The PSC will report to and be supervised by the Practice Lead and Senior Director (PLSD) for HCD and/or Managing Director of Sector Ops.</p>
<p>This position is not authorized to supervise any Federal employees.</p>
<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This notice is an update to the ARI TRAIN III requirement (W911NF-15-R-0009). The current ARI TRAIN II Multiple Award IDIQ contracts expire on 14 November 2015. The Army Contracting Command will not be hosting an Industry Day for ARI TRAIN III in fiscal year 2016. Instead, the ARI TRAIN III requirements will be solicited under the OASIS (One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services) program, http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/161367. The Task Order Requests will be solicited under Pool 2 of the OASIS program, which includes NAICS code 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) beginning in December 2015 or January 2016. <br />There will be future program announcements issued by the OASIS team to add new contractors to OASIS Pool 2, and this will be your opportunity to submit a proposal for consideration under OASIS. The Army Contracting Command has not made a final decision regarding whether or not a separate Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) program will be awarded for ARI TRAIN III. The OASIS program will be utilized and evaluated first prior to making any final decisions on a new MATOC. <br />The immediate opportunity is to become a subcontractor with an existing OASIS Pool 2 prime contractor. The list of OASIS prime contractors is available on the OASIS website. Figure what core competencies and value your organization brings to potential solutions, network with the OASIS Pool 2 prime contractors, and figure out the best ways to work together.
<p>A key step to becoming an OASIS prime contractor is being ready for an on-ramp when one happens. The BEST way to do this is to examine and understand the original OASIS and OASIS SB solicitations, http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/243631.</p>
<p>All on-ramp solicitations will be almost identical to the original solicitations. Familiarize yourself with the structure of OASIS, the Pools, the point system, relevant experience projects, pool qualification projects, etc. The better you understand the solicitations, the more you can do now to strengthen your potential score when the right on-ramp opportunity comes available.</p>
<br /><br />Information Regarding ARI TRAIN III: <br /><br />With the rapid changes in and proliferation of Army needs, the ARI must continue to support building and sustaining an all-volunteer Force composed of highly competent and resilient Soldiers, adaptive leaders, and cohesive teams of Army professionals. The envisioned procurement, the ARI TRAIN III program, will be in support of these aspects of ARI's mission: <br /><br />Analyzing Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training needs and requirements <br /><br />Design and development of exemplar or prototype methods for Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training <br /><br />Design, conduct, analysis, and assessment of research interventions in Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training <br /><br />Design, development, and evaluation of methods for the implementation and management of Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training programs <br /><br />Design, development, evaluation, and incorporation of innovative state-of-the-art technology for efficiencies in Soldier, leader, unit and organizational development and training <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<DESC><p>This announcement, dated 3 January 2019, serves to distribute the electronic version of the Government pre-solicitation conference presentation issued and presented during the 19 December 2018 pre-solicitation conference general session.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, this announcement satisfies the presolicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.203.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), N6134019R0007, for the procurement of the TH-XX aircraft. The IFR certified TH-XX aircraft will replace the TH-57B/C aircraft currently utilized by the United States (U.S.) Navy for advanced helicopter training for undergraduate pilots. NAVAIR anticipates the award of a single firm fixed price contract from the issuance of this full and open competition solicitation, with the total procurement of 130 commercial aircraft through a base and four options. Contract award is anticipated in the 1st Quarter of Government fiscal year 2020.</p>
<p>NAVAIR previously posted information to industry regarding the TH-XX requirement on FedBizOpps with reference to solicitation number "N6134017R9999" via a special notice on 01 June 2017 and several subsequent amendments. NAVAIR updated the solicitation number and posted information to industry regarding the TH-XX requirement on FedBizOpps with reference to the new solicitation number N6134019R0007 via a special notice on 21 September 2018 and subsequent amendments. These postings are considered exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals as defined in FAR 15.201(c), and include the draft RFP, industry questions and Government answers, and other relevant information pertaining to the TH-XX requirement. The final RFP, including all solicitation requirements, will supersede all previously posted draft documents (including industry questions and Government answers) in their entirety.</p>
<p>The Government intends to release the formal RFP no earlier than 22 January 2019.</p>
<p>This presolicitation notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation, nor will the Government be liable for costs involved in submission of information in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be provided. Interested parties are encouraged to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of the referenced solicitation, which will serve as the formal electronic transmission method of the solicitation. The Government DOES NOT intend to conduct another pre-proposal/industry day conference for this acquisition. Questions or correspondence should be directed in writing to the points of contact for this action: Mr. Blake Strickland, Contracting Officer, blake.strickland@navy.mil and Ms. Hayley Graham, Contract Specialist, hayley.graham@navy.mil with a copy to Ms. Alana Nu&ntilde;ez-Bennett, alana.nunez-bennett@navy.mil.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Louisville District intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for multiple projects located at Scott Air Force Base. The descriptions for these projects are provided as follows:</p>
<p>Project 1 - Building 1575 Add / Alter Facility: Add to and Alter a total of 74,658 SF at Building 1575. Work includes placement of brick veneer, steel trusses, and sloped standing seam metal roof, raised flooring, all utilities, mechanical and electrical equipment, redundant electrical and communications systems, communications rooms, storage, emergency backup generators, uninterruptable power, fire protection and alarm systems, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) installation, and systems furniture in mission integration space. Structural upgrades will be accomplished to meet seismic requirements. Project will require phasing and seismic improvements to the 6 foot raised floor.</p>

The renovated facility provides a new interior with an enhanced working environment and greater efficiency, and will accommodate current and future technology for another 40 years of service. The renovation will also include complete demolition of all exterior walls, leaving only the structural support system. The building is a 314,000 SF three story facility and will require additional bracing to account for seismic ratings in this region and must meet progressive collapse requirements. The project will then require new exterior masonry finish. Phased construction and swing space for occupants may also be included as part of the construction scope. Project may require phasing and will require extensive demolition, seismic improvements, sensitive compartmented information facility construction and cybersecurity considerations.</p>
<p>Project 3 - Joint Operations and Mission Planning Center: Construct a 171,803 square feet (SF) Joint Operations and Mission Planning Center utilizing economical design and construction methods. The preliminary building concept design consists of a two-level structure built above grade that is primarily symmetrical and rectilinear in nature with a steel superstructure; reinforced concrete foundation walls and footings; insulated and reinforced concrete exterior walls with embedded thin brick masonry fa&ccedil;ade; and an insulated standing seam metal roof. The project includes classified storage, communications infrastructure, air conditioning, space for uninterruptable power systems, emergency backup power generator, intrusion detection, fire detection/suppression, utilities, area lighting, general site improvements, pavement and all other required supporting facilities to result in a complete and usable facility.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT AND NAICS: <br />These projects will individually be solicited via Request for Proposal (RFP) and each solicitation will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) for these projects will be 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.<br />TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: <br />Projects #1 and #2 will be unrestricted procurements. As such, in accordance with FAR 19.1307 the HUBZone price preference will be applicable to the respective solicitations.<br />It is anticipated that Project #3 will also be an unrestricted procurement, pending completion of the Government's market research efforts. <br />SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Each of these projects will follow the Design-Bid-Build process, and will utilize a single phase procurement and the basis of award is the Best Value Trade-Off process. The technical information contained in the Offeror's proposal will be reviewed, evaluated, and rated by the Government. The proposal for these procurements, at a minimum, will consist of the following: Prime Contractor Past Performance, Technical (i.e. Management Plan, Schedule, etc.), Small Business Participation Plan, and Price. Pro Forma Information such as bonding and financial capability will also be required to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>

Following the Government's evaluation of Stagger 1 proposals, an amendment (Stagger 2 amendment) will be issued to each offeror that submitted a proposal in response to the first Stagger. The Stagger 2 amendment will include instructions for offerors to submit a Stagger 2 proposal consisting of Small Business Participation Plan, Price and Pro Forma Information.</p>
<p>NOTE: These procedures are NOT the Two Phase procedures utilized on Design/Build projects; as such, there will not be "Down Selection" made in between Stagger 1 and Stagger 2.</p>

Firms are strongly encouraged to provide comments, questions, and suggestions relative to the RFI scope, methodologies and technologies, and approach. Any input that businesses or interested parties would like to provide will be reviewed and considered.</p>
<p>Scope and Background: <br />The USMS is responsible for the physical security of over 1,000 facilities throughout 94 districts and within the 12 judicial circuits in the United States and its Territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands). These facilities are located in both densely populated metropolitan areas as well as sparsely populated remote locations covering larger geographic areas. Each facility may consist of any combination of publicly accessible, administrative, secure and prisoner detention and movement spaces. Included in this responsibility is the necessity to inventory and maintain between 500,000 and 600,000 physical security assets. The USMS operates advanced physical security equipment, both mechanical (locks, bollards, vehicle barriers, etc.) and electronic (Video Management Systems, Video Intercoms, Access Control Systems, and Intrusion Detection Systems, etc.) All installed equipment is designed to protect all participants in the federal judicial process to include access control, surveillance, alarm monitoring, threat reporting and response. The USMS is not resourced to organically maintain the equipment its personnel operate. <br />Instructions:<br />After reviewing the attached Performance Work Statement and Questions contained herein, interested parties are asked to submit a capability statement in Microsoft Word or PDF Format in response to this RFI by e-mail no later than 12:00 pm, EST, Friday, January 25, 2019 to OSC.PROCUREMENTS@USDOJ.GOV titled "[Company Name] NPS Installation and Maintenance RFI Response". All information provided to the Government must be UNCLASSIFIED material only. Any company proprietary information must be marked as such. Capability Statements shall not exceed fifteen (15) double-sided 8 &frac12; x 11 pages, with one inch margins, and not exceed 12pt Times New Roman font. The Capability Statement should demonstrate the respondent's competencies to effect acceptable performance in execution of the current state of the USMS' NPS Installation and Maintenance Program, as well as efficiencies offered by the respondent the USMS could benefit from if implemented. In addition to addressing each of the questions contained herein, respondents should include as part of their submission:<br />1. COMPANY INFORMATION: Company name, address, phone number, a point of contact with email address; Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; and small business status, if applicable, including status as a small disadvantaged business, 8(a) business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business under NAICS code 561621.</p>
<p>If applicable, provide a list of all relevant Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts and Federal Supply Schedule contracts your firm previously held and/or currently holds. Please include the contract number and expiration date for each.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE SUMMARY: Respondents may submit a summary of recent and relevant past performance supporting their stated capabilities to successfully perform an effort of this size and scope. Include Contracting Activities/Agencies, Contract Numbers, Contract Value, Contract Period of Performance, Scope of equipment and services provided during the period of performance, and a Point of Contact at the Contracting Activity who can verify the information provided.</p>

<p><br />Questions:</p>
<p><br />1. Please review the attached Performance Work Statement, and edit the document to reflect any changes or additions you feel will help to improve efficiency and promote innovation, or items you feel are unduly restrictive. <br />2.

<DESC>Program Manager, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PM PNT), GPS Army (SMC/GPA), and the Survivability, vulnerability and Assessment Directorate (SVAD) at the White Sands Test Center (WSTC) requests a firm-fixed price modification to contract W9124Q-14-D-0001 with Raytheon K-Tech,1300 Eubank Blvd. SE, Albuquerque, NM 87123-3336, for a contract ceiling increase and period of performance extension. This action will allow additional Thermal Spray primer and powder kits to be purchased to support on-going production of current Global Positioning System (GPS) Precise Positioning Service (PPS) User Equipment (UE). This modification will increase the contract ceiling by $3,729,320 and add three (03) one-year options to the period of performance through December 2021.<br />PM PNT's mission is to provide optimal and affordable positioning, navigation and timing capabilities with designs, products, and solutions that promote decisive action in all Army operations. In support of its mission, PM PNT works with the Survivability, Vulnerability and Assessment Directorate (SVAD) / White Sands Test Center (WSTC), due to its unique storage capabilities and support to the GPS, to provide Thermal Spray primer and powder kits to the GPS UE industry. The primer is sprayed over electronic circuits and coated with the powder. Under high temperature, the primer and powder fuse into a hard ceramic coating that protects the underlying circuits from external tampering.

Acquisition Plan Action ID:___ 36C261-19-AP-1337___

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System/ PR# 593-19-2-140-0053

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  

Annual Service and Maintenance for the VASNHS Patient Elopement and Wandering (PEW) System. This system reduces patient elopement and increases safety and care of patients. This system integrates with RTLS (Centrak, Inc. proprietary software and system).  
Total= $87,368.99
Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  

The VA currently utilizes RTLS setup by Centrak, Inc.. Centrak is the only vendor capable of performing integration with RTLS within the VA due to the proprietary and contractual nature of RTLS. The PEW System at the VASNHS is an extension of RTLS and is proprietary in nature to Centrak. The interoperability between these two Centrak owned systems is proprietary and requires Centrak to provide necessary licensure and hardware to provide support. 
Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:

Market research was conducted to see if Centrak has proprietary rights to their software licensure and maintenance for the Centrak PEW system. According to the contractor, CenTrak Security Solutions, Patient Elopement and Wandering solution, including software, middleware and hardware is developed and owned exclusively by CenTrak. Support and Maintenance of Centrak Security Solutions is provided only by CenTrak, Inc.
