<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for continued Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS), e.g., program management, development and delivery of documentation, and planning effort for the CDLS service to support the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  The contractor shall furnish all required labor, facilities, equipment (except Government-furnished), tools, test equipment, packing, preservation and packaging, parts, software, documentation and any other technical or administrative support necessary to provide the required depot level logistics support.  WAAS CDLS support includes contractor management, integrated logistics support, configuration management, line replaceable unit (LRU) testing of all LRUs returned from WAAS sites, exchange and repair (E&R) and/or return and repair (R&R) of LRUs, fabrication and/or procurement of LRUs, repair procedures, supply support to all WAAS sites, response to web-based Logistics Inventory System (LIS) requests for parts, bar coding of WAAS assets returned to the depot, engineering change proposals, technical assistance/engineering services, and the generation of depot related Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) items as required by the FAA.  The draft Statement Of Work, dated June 15, 2007, is provided as a separate document under this market survey.  The WAAS uses a network of precisely located ground reference stations that monitor Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals.  These stations collect and process GPS information and send the information to WAAS master stations that develop a WAAS correction message sent to user receivers via navigation transponders on geo-stationary (GEO) satellites.  The WAAS message improves the accuracy, availability, and integrity of GPS-derived position information.  The contract is required for the sustainment of the WAAS in support of the National Airspace System (NAS). The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219, with a size standard of $6.5/Million The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  These services are only known to be available from Raytheon Company, 1801 Hughes Dr., Fullerton, CA, 92833-2200, the original manufacturer, because they own the proprietary data rights for the manufacturing and engineering specifications along with the software code (Circuit schematics/revision information/software/firmware updates) for the WAAS.  The FAA does not have available complete technical documentation to allow other sources to repair and support this system.   This requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA AMS Section 3.2.2.4.  This procurement is considered to be single source based upon Raytheon's proprietary data for support of this system.  The FAA announces its intent to contract with Raytheon Company, Fullerton, CA, using single source procedures. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA. This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $750,000.

The project area contains approximately 135 acres.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, and services to implement the Evergreen 1 Fuel Reduction Project on the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grasslands.

It is the intent of the Government in Phase 2 to make one or more awards to perform one, two, or all of the following efforts: implement and support the integration testbed; investigate and implement data/sensor fusion and behavioral algorithms; and modify, adapt, install and integrate selected sensors.  There will only be one integrator selected to develop and test a single system on the base.  But it is anticipated that several ancillary awards will be made for specific sensors and behavioral analysis algorithms to be integrated into the single system.

It is the expectation of the Government that participants in Phase 2 will work with the testbed systems integrator and vice versa with standard non-disclosure agreements.  Data assertions must be made per Section F of the Technical Proposal instructions.

Note: No contractor selected for the award of Phase 1 is restricted from participation in the competition of the additional Phases under this or any resultant follow-on BAA or RFP.

<DESC>TheWestern Area Power Administration, Upper Great Plains Region, North Dakota Maintenance Office intends to issue a Purchase Order  on a sole source basis to TransTel Group Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The requirement is for stationary cellular phone packages.  Presently we have Trans Tel Group, INC analog phones (RTS-100-N3R) at ninety-one remote metering sites. Western Area Power Administration started upgrading these sites 1.5 years ago as their Maintenance Schedule and budget dollars allowed to meet the change from anolog to digital technology.  We can upgrade these units and have direct replacement units with Trans Tels Model # RTS-DCU-C (CDMA, Modem connectivity to Verizon). This will reduce the cost for installation (no new wiring will be required) and using the same style equipment will reduce errors resulting in less time for installation.  The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about August 3,2007 at http://e-center.doe.gov/ as a 100% small business set-aside. This notice is not a request for proposals/quotes.  However interested parties may identify their interest and capabilty to satisfy the Government's requirements by emailing or faxing the Contract Specialist at 701-221-4526.

<DESC>TRANSIMS APPLICATION RESEARCH: REQUEST FOR BAA PROPOSALS:

Section 5512 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Public Law 109-59, provides funding for the acceleration of TRANSIMS deployment, training on the use of TRANSIMS and development of new applications of TRANSIMS. The goal of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to support academic research/scientific study directed toward increasing the understanding of travel behavior and to improve tools and methods for modeling travel demand and transport systems. Multiple awards are anticipated. This BAA differs from previous TRANSIMS BAAs in that the awards under this BAA will focus on academic research and the size of the awards will be sufficient to fund the equivalent of a graduate student with support from a faculty advisor for one year.

A. Background
The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is travel simulation system designed to meet the State Department of Transportations? (DOTs') and Metropolitan Planning Organizations? (MPOs') need for more accurate and more sensitive travel forecasts for transportation planning and emissions analysis.  It consists of mutually supporting simulations, models, and databases.  By employing advanced computational and analytical techniques, it creates an integrated environment for regional transportation system analysis.
Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits to and impacts on different geographies and travel markets can be evaluated as well. Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems. TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods in its underlying concepts and structure. These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time; a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based microsimulator.
There are four primary modules: 
?	Population synthesizer, 
?	Activity generator, 
?	Route planner, and 
?	Traffic microsimulator. 
Using these components, a model may be constructed that estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a microsimulation of all persons, vehicles and resulting traffic on modeled transport systems in given study area.
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (www.lanl.gov) designed and developed the original TRANSIMS algorithms and software. The design for TRANSIMS is based on requirements in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Public Law (PL) 102-240), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (PL 105-178) as amended by the TEA 21 Restoration Act (PL 105-206), and the Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101-549) Amendments. The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Federal Transit Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.

B. Current Status
TRANSIMS development has proceeded along several lines. These include development of application methods, software and supporting utilities.  
Methods Development
Currently USDOT is sponsoring the development of a tour-based model, using TRANSIMS, in Portland, Oregon. The effort has been divided into two tracks:
?	Track 1 uses existing trip tables, combined with the TRANSIMS Router and Microsimulator, to develop regional simulations of travel. The Track 1 effort has demonstrated that using network and trip table data currently available at most MPOs, regional simulations can be conducted. As part of the Track 1 effort utilities have been developed to convert existing networks and trip tables to TRANSIMS format.
?	Track 2, currently underway, will develop tour based forecasting procedures based on the Portland transportation network and demand data available to the Portland MPO. Track 2 is expected to be completed in the summer of 2007.
Software
The software and source code is now available under the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3. This license makes the source code publicly available and requires that any changes to the original code be made publicly available. Also, the license permits re-use within another software package without entangling the license terms. Further information see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php  
In addition to the core software, supporting utilities have been developed based on the work in Portland and other studies. These utilities include methods to convert node and link data into TRANSIMS format, estimate intersection signalization, and assist with data preparation and application. The TRANSIMS software is written in C++. 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are available for Linux and Windows (pre-Vista). Support is available via documentation and forums.  The source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/. To download the software and for more information on the software, forums, and supporting utilities, see http://transims-opensource.net/

All sanitation facility construction services listed above will be performed for Individual Homes and Communities on Indian Reservations served by the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Service within New Mexico, Western Texas, Southern Colorado, and Southeast Utah.

Phase I will be a competitive evaluation of the firms past performance history and qualifications. Each of these firms will be evaluated and rated and ranked by a source selection board. Up to five firms may be selected and requested to participate in Phase II.   

Phase II will be for the seed project and will involve construction of sanitation facilities as described as required for a complete project.

The Indian Health Service will provide minimum specification and drawing packages to the selected contractors which shall be used as minimum requirements. The contractor?s will be required to design a complete building package providing the most amenities possible within the budgeted funds available conforming to the drawings and specification.  The estimated project size is in excess of $100,000.00 dollars for both design and construction. Some projects may be higher limits and some projects may be lower limits. Not all projects will require design efforts.  Pricing will be established as designing within fee limitations and the final construction lump sum price will be negotiated.  

Award of the seed project will be made to one firm whose proposal, conforming to the requirements is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror. 

As the need develops, each of the five firms will be issued minimum plans and specifications and requested to submit a technical and price proposal. Again, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered. 

There is no guarantee as to the amount of work a contractor will receive during the term of the contract. Each project will be a competitive negotiated procurement therefore contractors must submit their most favorable prices.  

In most cases, project funding is immediately available to start construction therefore all discounts should be sought.  

Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contract.  Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussion.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable. 

Bid Bonds will not be required to be submitted with Phase I proposals.  100 Percent Payment and Performance bonds will be required once the final negotiated price of each delivery order is established. Contractors must provide bonding within 10 calendar days from notice of award. NAICS CODE IS 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. This procurement is set aside for Indian owned small business firms. Therefore, offers will be accepted from all responsive and responsible Indian owned small business concerns.

The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors? proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  A detailed project description and overall project performance requirements for this project will be included in the Request for Proposals (RFP) package.  The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree of design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements.  The successful contractor must design and construct a complete and usable facility, as described in the RFP documents.  One solicitation will be issued covering both phases.  Proposals will be evaluated in Phase I to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase II, and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors.  Selection of offerors for involvement in Phase II will be based on management approach and performance capability.  Detailed project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of the Phase II stage of the Request for Proposals.   

In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases and can be summarized as follows:

(1)	Recent Relevant Past Design/Build Performance
(2)	Organization and Key Personnel
(3)	Design/Build Management Approach
(4)	Past Performance on Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women Owned Small Businesses

Phase II ? Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  A maximum of five (5) offerors will advance to Phase II.  Proposals shall include Pro Forma Requirements and Financial Statement.  The Proposals will be evaluated on the following technical factors.  The rated technical evaluation criteria under Phase II, and price, are considered equal.  

(1)	Technical Approach
(2)	Particular Project Execution Strategies

However, if an appropriate and reasonable pass through plan can be provided, it will be considered. All interested parties considering submission in support of this request for technical support should submit a white paper no greater than 10 pages in length and should include at a minimum the following information: 1) Provide evidence of the contractors facilities and experience with type of repair and calibration support. 2) Provide evidence of past performance on similar projects in support of the requested work. 3) Respondents should offer white papers on a total support approach.  Partial support for selected items from the list will not be accepted.  This response must address support of all equipment. 4) The contractor must show knowledge of the GUARDRAIL weapon system and past history with repair and support of the equipment for that system. This documentation may be mailed to US Army, Commander CECOM, AMSEL-LC-IEWS-R-GR, Building 1201W, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5211 to the attention of Christopher Alcott.  Documentation may also be sent to electronic address Christopher.alcott@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to negotiate with the University of Miami-Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), 1430 NW 11 AVE, Miami, FL 33136-1042, a contract on a sole source basis for access to a web-based training system for all Department of Navy (DON) personnel in the area of human subject research protection.  The proposed contract is for one year with 4 option years for a total of $600,000. CITI has developed and runs a web based program containing training modules specifically drafted by subject matter experts to address human research protection requirements and directed towards the unique issues associated with the subject area and encountered by the individuals involved in the process.  CITI currently has 11 basic modules focused on social and behavioral research; 17 basic modules focused on biomedical research; and continuing education modules.  Given their unique capabilities, the University of Miami CITI is the only responsible source and no other supplier can meet the Navy?s requirements as described below.

CITI has developed and runs a web based program containing training modules specifically drafted by subject matter experts to address human research protection requirements and directed towards the unique issues associated with the subject area and encountered by the individuals involved in the process.  CITI currently has 11 basic modules focused on social and behavioral research; 17 basic modules focused on biomedical research; and continuing education modules.  
 
The effort will provide DON-wide access to a web-based training program containing subject matter content specifically addressing Human Research Protection requirements under Federal regulation and Department of Defense (DOD) directives and DON policies.  Web access permits training of CONUS and OCONUS personnel ashore, afloat, and in remote locations, meeting the broad training mandates of SECNAVINST 3900.39D applicable to individuals conducting research or involved in the process of approving or administering biomedical and socio-behavioral Human Research Protection efforts.  Currently, it is estimated that approximately 10,000 DON personnel in 45 DON institutions/commands will require training and continuing education.  This number is expected to increase as the DON Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) outreach continues.  The effort will also include potential modification of existing training modules as well as addition of new training modules to reflect DOD and DON unique Human Research Protection requirements and updates and developments in the industry practice.  In addition, the effort would provide tracking reports, technical support and help desk services; and management and coordination efforts with ONR Code 343 Human Research Protection Division.  Since training is required prior to the performance, review, administration, and approval of human subject research, timely access is necessary to enable the uninterrupted and responsible conduct of DON research in accordance with SECNAVINST 3900.39D. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for EchoTherm IR NDI System upgrade v.8.x including software and hardware to upgrade an existing thermal imaging system.   Description of Requirement: - Upgrade consists of enhanced software and changes to the acquisition hardware.   - New hardware features widen the range of available test configurations.   NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Thermal Wave Imaging.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.   Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The hardware/ software upgrade described is an integrated add-on to the existing thermal imaging system.  Purchase of this equipment from a different vendor would result in unacceptable hardware and software incompatibilities due to the proprietary nature of the existing system.  Therefore it would be the best interest of the government to purchase directly from Thermal Wave Imaging.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08/13/2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with Harris RF Communication, 1680 University Avenue, Rochester, NY  14610-1839.  The contract type is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Price commercial type contract.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Harris RF Communication is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's minimum requirement.  The Contract Line Item Numbers and descriptions are:  CLIN 0001 - Personal Role Radio (105 each) consisting of Team Radio, Green Rechargeable P/N RF-7800S-TR001; Antenna P/N 12055-2700-01; Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery P/N 12055-2100-01; Headset, Lightweight P/N 12055-0300-01 ; Holster, SPR P/N 12055-6060-01; Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery P/N 12055-2100-01; and Operators Manual; CLIN 0002 - Personal Role Radio Ancillaries consisting of Battery Charger, Multi Bay P/N 12055-2500-01 (21 each); Fill Software w/Cable P/N 12055-2800-01 (21 each); and Cable Assembly (UK/Ireland BS 1363) P/N 10181-9809-009 (21 each).  The requested Harris RF Communication equipment is the only equipment that meets the requirements listed.  Only Harris produces receiver-transmitters (R/T) and associated equipment that provides tactical communications between multi-national counterparts and compatibility with U.S. Special Forces.  The requested Personal Role Radio is the only radio that is compatible and interoperable with already fielded Harris RF equipment.   These capabilities provide the interoperability that is proprietary to Harris RF.   These products have gone through an extensive process of integration and testing to ensure compatibility with currently fielded hardware and software.  The requested Harris RF is the only equipment that can send and receive messages to and from the existing field units.  Any deviation from the current infrastructure could jeopardize current operations.  The purchase of any other radios would result in duplicate costs to the government to modify the current design, recreate baseline drawings, testing and validation costs, operator and maintenance training costs, in addition to the logistical costs of managing two different systems.     THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.   However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 06 August 2007, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  Award is expected to be on or about 27 August 2007.   For information contact Cindy Wilson, Code 2.5.1.2.2.2, Telephone (301) 995-8672, FAX (301) 995-8670 or via e-mail: cindy.wilson@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541611   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the presenter, Gladstein, Neandross, and Associates, for sponsorship of the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference (East Coast) that will take place July 8 - 10, 2008, at the Jacob Javits Center, New York, NY.   The Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference is sponsored by a unique collaboration of environmental groups, maritime industry, organized maritime labor, freight and trucking companies, community activists, government regulators, clean technology vendors,  and policy makers.  As a sponsor of this conference, the US EPA will participate and share in the information and experiences generated during the conference.   The primary focus of the conference is to provide a venue to showcase the innovative programs, policies and technologies now being  implemented in the region and at other ports throughout the nation to improve efficiency and reduce the air quality impacts of the goods movement industry.  Experts and practitioners alike will share success stories and highlight solutions which result in positive economic and environmental  benefits for their communities.   The goal of the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference (East Coast) is to spur the adoption of these innovative practices and low-emission technologies by increasing awareness and providing opportunities for solution-oriented stakeholders to network.  This  conference provides a unique venue for members of the goods movement industry to address issues together while communicating the positive steps that have already been taken by sponsors and others to the public, elected officials and the media.  Gladstein, Neandross, and Associates is the presenter  of the Faster Freight- Cleaner Air Conference (East Coast).  Sponsorship of this conference will allow EPA access to key national stakeholders in the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air dialog, participation of EPA staff on working group teams for assistance in development of the conference agenda,  speaker selection, session topics, event logistics, and other input and guidance related to planning the event.  Sponsorship will also allow EPA to have exhibit space with priority location to maximize visibility and attendee foot traffic for display of EPA work accomplished in relation to the  conference.   Sponsorship will also allow EPA access to site visits, tours, demonstrations, and participation in the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference marketing, public awareness, communications, and education outreach programs and products.  The EPA believes that Gladstein, Neandross, and  Associates is the only firm able to provide access to the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference (East Coast).   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing access to the conference presented by Gladstein, Neandross,  and Associates may submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received  will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be  honored.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding special methylation studies on Environmental and Genetic Lung cancer Etiology, (EAGLE) biospecimens from lung cancer cases (blood and tissue) and controls (blood only) with The Universita Degli Studi Di Milano, Milan, Italy. The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 with the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. EAGLE (Environmental and Genetic Lung cancer Etiology) is a large population-based case-control study including over 2,000 incident lung cancer cases and over 2,000 age-, sex-, and residence-matched healthy controls. The study setting involves five cities and 216 surrounding municipalities in the Lombardy region of Italy, encompassing over 1.3 million people in the selected age range of 35-79 years. Few studies have the wealth of data and information of the EAGLE study in order to investigate the exposure, genetic and clinical correlates of methylated gene findings. The relationship of these changes in tissue and blood to exposure profile, histology, outcome and clinical characteristics and other molecular studies is a key focus of our effort. The laboratory at the University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Osdedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan Italy has conducted aberrant DNA methylation and epigenetic gene expression studies on peripheral blood using bisulfite-PCR pyrosequencing and allele specific pyrosequencing for specific genes. The laboratory has conducted these studies on over 200 subjects similar to the target population to be of EAGLE, i.e. healthy individuals including tobacco smokers, selected from the same region (based on environmental exposures, age, gender, etc.) The laboratory is uniquely qualified to perform studies involving characterization of cancer genes from both blood and tissue. Studies cannot be conducted in different laboratories since this would make a tissue/blood comparison impossible and the variation introduced by the different laboratories would be hard to quantitate. The EAGLE samples are precious and irreplaceable. The molecular tissue assays required for this study derive from the Lombardy region of Italy in the region where the proposed study laboratory is located. The laboratory investigators understand the unique nature of this resource since they spent much of the last 5 years organizing the collection of this unique specimen collection. This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on August 13, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov    In addition; contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Purchase of Low Density Array Plates for Gene Profiling of Colon Tumors, Paired Non-Tumorous Tissue and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Samples

Purpose/Brief History:

One of the research projects the LHC is working on is the role inflammatory genes play in carcinogenesis and their expression patterns in tumors and/or adjacent non-tumorous tissue may be predictive of prognosis.  The LHC will profile a set of 23 inflammatory genes in clinical samples to determine if these genes are associated with colon tumorigenesis and have clinically useful prognostic value.  The LHC will also profile these same genes in tissue samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease in an attempt to identify signatures of genes associated with these diseases and compare them to tumor tissues.  A subset of these genes have already been shown have prognostic value in liver and lung cancer patients

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The LHC is ordering 80 custom made Taqman low density array cards from Applied Biosystems.  Each card allows the LHC to profile 24 genes (23 inflammatory genes and 1 control) across 640 samples with quantitative RT-PCR in 384-well plates.  All of the plates must be ordered together to insure that they are manufactured at the same time. These plates are the only plates of their kind and are compatible with Applied BioSystems equipment available to the LHC.  Applied Biosystems is the sole source for this product.  There is no existing alternative that will allow custom made plates for multiplexing in the 384-well plates.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a sole source procurement to the U.S. Bancorp DBA U. S. Bank located in Minneapolis, MN to perform ancillary lockbox services associated with the lockbox collection of directly billed premiums for Medicare. This award is in conjunction with the basic lockbox collection services provided to CMS by U. S. Bank through a Treasury Financial Agent Agreement designated by Department of the Treasury authority. 

Department of the Treasury is required by law to be provided and paid for basic lockbox collection services to Federal agencies through a designated Treasury agent. The Department of the Treasury goes through a lengthy strategic acquisition and evaluation process to ensure that all designated Treasury agents meet stringent requirements necessary to provide banking services to federal agencies. The U.S. Bank has been designated by Treasury as the agent to provide basic lockbox services to CMS for which the Department of the Treasury assumes the financial responsibility for the cost of the basic collection services.  The ancillary services required in the CMS contract to be awarded under this procurement are CMS specific and, although necessary for CMS, falls outside of the basic services that are required to be provided and paid by Treasury. The ancillary services required under this procurement are an integral part of the basic lockbox collection process and should not be separated from the primary collection functions provided by the Treasury agent. To remove the ancillary services from the basic function lockbox services and place them with another company would be unnecessarily redundant, procedurally devastating, interfere with appropriate audit and reconciliation, risk the possible loss of personal beneficiary information, potentially delay collection of funds, and result in additional cost.

The U.S. Bank is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks in this procurement most economically and efficiently because, as mentioned above, has been designated by Treasury as the CMS? lockbox provider for which the Department of the Treasury assumes the financial responsibility for the cost of the basic collection services. A cost plus fixed-fee contract will be awarded with a base period of one year and four (4) one year options.  CMS also reserves the right to continue this contract effort under the JOFOC to be in place covering two (2) two-year extensions that currently exist in the Treasury Financial Agent Agreement for basic lockbox collection services, resulting in a possible 9 year contract duration.  

This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will consider all responses received NLT 3:00 PM EDT, 16 Aug 2007.  Responses shall be submitted to Monica N. Carter.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990.  


STATEMENT OF WORK - The OCC requires a responsible vendor to provide a slate of products to facilitate economic and financial analysis of the U.S. economy. These products should provide ready access to data, forecasts, and analysis of the U.S. economy, including regional detail by state and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and by sector.  The vendor should have proven analytical expertise in the areas covered by the products. The vendor must provide technical support to help GBFA users retrieve and understand the data and forecasts provided.  The vendor should include a description of technical support to be provided, which should include telephone access to a user desk, access to analysts, quick response to questions and issues, and regular conferences or client meetings to discuss economic issues.  The vendor must include appropriate price information, including the cost of providing the service for one year, followed by two option years.  PRODUCTS - The products offered should include:  REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATABASE - The database should allow access for up to 30 users, and should cover the economy at the national, state, and MSA level. The database should include historical data and forecasts; where possible, historical data should go back to 1980 or earlier. Data should be updated at least monthly; forecasts should be updated at least quarterly; regional data should cover all the states and MSAs. Data and forecasts should have the following characteristics:
Consistency.  Data must be compiled and forecasts must be applied using consistent methods for MSAs, States and U.S. economic series to permit sound analysis.  Forecast models must integrate regional factors directly into their national forecasts in order to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Frequent updates.  Forecasts must be updated with sufficient frequency to enable inclusion of the most up-to-date data in periodic GBFA presentations and reports.  
Comprehensive coverage.  Since national banks operate in both large and small metro areas, data and forecasts must include coverage of the MSAs in the U.S. (rather than just the top 100 or top 150) to help us identify and analyze local economic factors that affect the condition and performance of national banks.
Complementary regional and CRE analyses and reports.  Data and forecasts should, if possible, complement the regional economic and commercial real estate analyses that the OCC currently receives and uses in various products. This means the data and analysis should cover all the states and at least the top 100 MSAs, but preferably all MSAs.  STATE AND REGIONAL ANALYSIS -  GBFA requires periodic analyses of the economy of each state, and of as many MSAs as possible. These reports should be downloadable, and should be available to field staff as well as headquarters staff within the OCC. Reports should include history and forecasts for each region covered, and should be updated at least twice per year.   HOUSING MARKET ANALYSIS - Because of the importance of residential lending in the commercial banking system, GBFA requires regular reports and analysis on the state of the US residential real estate industry. Reports should include detailed analysis of national trends, as well as analysis of regional housing trends, preferably on an MSA level. Analysis should cover housing demand and supply, house price trends, and should identify which MSAs are relatively overpriced, and thus subject to greater risk for lenders. 

Reports should be downloadable, and should include data in spreadsheet format for GBFA?s use. Graphs in reports should be downloadable in a suitable format, such as Power Point.

WEB-BASED REPORTS ON ECONOMIC DATA RELEASES WITH COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS -  The product should allow real-time access to economic data releases, commentary on the releases, and analysis of the implications of the releases. The product should cover all sectors of the US economy, including financial markets, and should also include commentary and analysis of broader themes within the US economy, including retail and wholesale trade, housing and construction, labor markets, and manufacturing. Content should be searchable and browsable by topic, author, and date.  ELECTRONIC MEDIA SPECIFICATIONS - Data and model outputs should be suitable for use on OCC network, and OCC microcomputers. OCC microcomputers use the Windows XP operating system, with the Microsoft Office 2003 suite of applications, and SAS 9.1.3.


Products must allow the user to import model output into other software available to the user.  The following is a partial list of data formats commonly encountered:

Standard FFIEC format
ASCII Fixed format
ASCII Delimited format
Spreadsheet formats (i.e., Lotus, Excel, etc.)
SAS datasheet format

EVALUATION

To evaluate proposals submitted, the OCC will require the following:  1)  Description of products included in proposal. This should include some indication of geographic coverage and length of typical data series, although we understand that a description of each data series will not be possible; how long products have been commercially available; approximate number of users, both total and within the federal government.  2)  Explanation of how OCC users would access the product.  3)  Samples of existing products: for example, recent versions of state and local economic analysis, recent versions of housing analysis.  4)  Temporary access to databases, other on-line products, and economic models.  5)  Explanation of the company?s provision of technical support


The OCC?s assessment of technical capability will focus on, but not be limited to:  1)  Examination of products for coverage, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency with existing OCC applications.  2)  Examination of product history, outside evaluation of products, and experience of other users of products.  3)  Tests of databases and other on-line products for ease of use.   4)  Examination of product documentation for clarity and accuracy.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Synopsis is a revision of the 2 Jul 07 W56HZVAMBSHELTER Synopsis. The Government has a firm requirement for purchase and installation of a minimum of 808 each Ambulance Shelters at a rate of 60 per month between Aug 08 and Jul 09. The Government  desires to accelerate this delivery but may not be able to do so based on the M1152 HMMWV GFM availability.  For evaluation purposes the Shelter offerors will be required to provide their projected costs for accelerated deliveries of some initial quantiti es. Evaluation of the offeror's ability to accelerate deliveries will impact selection only in the case where all other factors are considered essentially equal.  The estimated requirement for the three years will be for delivery of between 808 and 3088 sh elters to be integrated with Government furnished High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles.  This requirement will be placed on a 3 year Requirements Contract utilizing the firm Fixed Price Provision. The contractor will be required to provide the spare  parts to support shelter maintenance listed in the solicitation during the ordering period if ordered and provide the applicable Technical Manuals and Technical Bulletins. This initial Ambulance Shelter effort is to support an Afghanistan FMS requirement.  The Shelter production and installation effort must be completed within the required delivery schedule provided in the solicitation. Planned Quantity First Order is 808 each. Estimated Quantity for the First Year is 888, for the Second Year is 1100, and t he Third Year is 1100.  POC is Sharon Turner at 586-574-5888 email is sharon.turner@us.army.mil

We rarely send information out past 8 pm ET during the week, with the exception of public health emergencies should they arise.   Sometimes we go a couple of months without releasing anything.  Sometimes we will issue 3 or four releases a week.  However, the Contractor may be required to issue more transmissions due to the Agency?s requirements.  Please note, that the Contractor will be held to providing unlimited releases.

The proposal due date is hereby extended until 8/7/2007 @ 9:00 am EST.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.  
Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the AN/FPS-133, Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS).  The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 May 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group.  The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites and other objects penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite and space debris metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008). The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                              
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause)

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO REVISE PARAGRAPH ONE AND THE SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION SECTION OF THIS NOTICE TO READ AS FOLLOWS:  
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS), to (1) procure a license to continue utilizing Haz-Map and (2) acquire professional services, on a sole source basis, from Dr. Jay Brown, of Indiana, for the purpose of updating, enhancing and providing specialized consultation on the Haz-Map database.  

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, Dr. Jay Brown is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Dr. Brown is uniquely qualified to offer these services.  He is the originator and sole author of Haz-Map and makes it available to NLM as a public resource.  Dr. Brown holds M.D. and M.P.D. degree and is Board Certified in Occupational Medicine by the American Board of Preventive Medicine and has over ten years of experience working in occupational medicine clinics.  In order for NLM/SIS to continue to further their mission the capabilities provided by Dr. Brown and Haz-Map are needed.  

Haz-Map (http://hazmap.nlm.nih.gov) is an occupational health database designed for health and safety professionals and for consumers seeking information about the health effects of exposure to chemicals and biologicals at work. Haz-Map links jobs and hazardous tasks with occupational diseases and their symptoms. It is one of the products and services made available by the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html).

Chemicals and biological agents in Haz-Map are linked to industrial processes and other activities such as hobbies. Occupational diseases and their symptoms are associated with hazardous job tasks and possible exposure to hazardous agents. Information from textbooks, journal articles, and electronic databases such as NLM's Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB?) is classified and summarized to create the database. HSDB is part of the TOXNET? (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov) system of databases related to toxicology and environmental health.


ORIGINAL NOTICE:  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS), to acquire professional services, on a sole source basis, from Dr. Jay Brown of Indiana, for the purposes of updating, enhancing and providing specialized consultation on the Haz-Map database.

BACKGROUND
The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) offers a variety of toxicology information to the public through the World Wide Web.  This information takes the form of bibliographic files such as TOXLINE and data files such as the Hazardous Substances Databank (HSDB).  Most files are not structured in such a way that a symptom developed in the workplace such as ?rash? can be tracked back to a given chemical or chemical class and/or type of job.  Haz-Map created by Dr. Jay Brown is such a database and it provides linkage between symptoms, jobs, and chemicals.  Specialized Information Services Division wishes to provide access to information in Haz-Map.  The experimental Haz-Map web site was made available to the public in May 2002 and since then the file has been updated and the web interface has been refined.

CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
Tasks may include but are not limited to the following:
1. Update the data in Haz-Map for completeness and compatibility with the SIS suite of databases.
2. Provide a list of core journals that are used for updating the content of the file and search PubMed for relevant information.
3. Provide Internet sources of relevant images for diseases and findings.
4. Enhance the job table by adding information on cancer risk.  This information can be added in a new field.
5. Consider ways for including new jobs not classified in the SOC code.
6. Add or modify information as needed.

A monthly progress report is required.  The progress report should include documentation of all changes, additions and deletion to the database.  Deliverables include an updated database of Haz-Map.  The NLM Project Officers will assign tasks, and work will be reviewed for completeness and timeliness.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MARKET SURVEY

TRANSPORTATION OF DRY CARGO TO/FROM PORT OF KARACHI & PORT QASIM, PAKISTAN TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources for intra-theater surface transportation of military cargo to/from the Ports of Karachi and Qasim, Pakistan to/from various destinations in Afghanistan.  There is no solicitation package at this time.  This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information and allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments for the development of the potential solicitation.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties will be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and will be used to develop the requirement.

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources that can provide reliable and secure Time Definite Delivery of containerized and break bulk military cargo from/to the ports in Karachi and Qasim, Pakistan to various locations in Afghanistan, with the majority of cargo deliveries to Bagram and Kandahar airfields.  The military cargo may consist of CLASS I (food and water), CLASS II (General Supplies), CLASS III Package (oils/lubricants), CLASS IV (Construction Materials), CLASS VI (AAFES Supplies), CLASS VII (Major End Items), CLASS VIII (Medical Supplies), CLASS IX (Repair Parts), or CLASS X (non-military goods such as humanitarian supplies).  The current operating environment presents significant risk.  This includes attacks, armed hijackings, strikes, border delays, accidents, and pilferage. Shipments from/to these ports to/from the various destinations in the region amount to approximately 9,600 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) and 8,300 forty foot equivalent units (FEU) per year.  Approximately 85% are dry containers and 15% are refrigerated (reefers).  The reefer breakout is 381 X 20 ft containers and  3,111 X 40 ft containers.  Additionally, breakbulk cargo totals approximately 20,000 Stons.  The Government requires transit times of between 7 to 12 days from acceptance at the ports to the various locations within Afghanistan.  

USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit a detailed response that specifically outlines your companys ability to:  
     
1.	Accept cargo at ports on behalf of the Government and deliver to the final destination.  Move cargo from locations in Afghanistan to ports in Pakistan.  This includes clearing customs.
2.	Transload cargo from ocean carrier containers to contractor provided containers at port.
3.	Ensure cargo loss rate is less than 1% (to include losses due to pilferage, accident, spoilage, attacks and acts of God).
4.	Provide real-time In-transit Visibility (ITV) compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the contracting officer.  
5.	Deliver cargo by the required delivery date (RDD) on a minimum of 90% of shipments.
6.	Provide direct delivery to Forward Operating Bases if required.
7.	Initiate process improvements and other value added services.  
8.	Provide customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and provide performance based views.  
9.	Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.  

USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment on this requirement to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (to include potential prime contractors, subcontractors, or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following:  

1.	A rough estimate of the cost to supply this service. 
2.	Your company?s capability in terms of providing all requirements listed above and the processes to execute (i.e. disciplined, controlled convoy movements, secure truck park areas along routes, enhanced customs clearance procedures).
3.	Specific identification of any limits to company?s capabilities.  
4.	Your company?s experience in providing the services described above and its experience with an operation similar in size and scope to that described above.
5.	The largest projects the company managed either as a prime or subcontractor including shipping volumes, total revenue, performance goal results and how long the relationship lasted.  
6.	Your companys recommended commercial pricing structure for the operation described above.  
7.	Recommended incentive provisions to motivate performance that will meet or exceed the goals of this effort (for example RDD, cargo loss metrics, ITV).  
8.	Description of companys teaming and relationship management with sub-contractors along with your company?s understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.  
9.	How the company would provide ITV, security, and process claims for lost, damaged or stolen freight.  

Send responses to charles.burton@ustranscom.mil no later than close of business on 2 Aug 2007.  No phone or FAX responses will be accepted.  Please ensure USTRANSCOM DRY CARGO MARKET SURVEY is listed in the subject line of your responses.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is interested in finding potential sources to provide Type 1 infrared services used to detect and map wildland fires. The government intends to set up multiple basic ordering/purchase agreements (BOA/BPA) with qualified vendors to provide these services on an as needed basis. Type 1 infrared systems are utilized to detect small heat sources distributed over large geographic areas and to map large wildland fires. Type 1 systems are capable of imaging large wildland fire incidents quickly to provide data for the Situation Unit Leader (SITL).  The information is used to help in the development of the Incident Action Plan (IAP).  Type 1 infrared systems are mounted on twin-engine or jet aircraft and can cover large geographic areas quickly. The government would require the contractor to be on call and provide the aircraft, pilot, Type 1 sensor system, associated support equipment and sensor operator. The contractor will be responsible for providing the sensor output (data) in a format that is compatible with the Forest Service and Department of Interior Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The government base of operations for these services will be the National Interagency Fire Center located in Boise, ID.

If you have any interest in providing these services to the government please contact Matt Olson, Contracting Specialist, by 26 June 2007 in order to discuss the possibility of setting up a BPA with your company.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions regarding the solicitation.  As a result, the solicitation is amended as follows:

Question:  Part number 033-3348rev1 appears to be 0.079 inches thick, but the RFQ states that the sheet material will be supplied at .040 inches thick.  Is this correct?  Would the sheets need to be welded together?

Answer:  All quoters shall double the required number of drawing number 038-3348rev1 components.  NIST will supply the additional Boron-10 Aluminum material as required .  The total thickness of two, (2), 038-3348rev1 stacked together and fastened with screws to components 038-3345rev1 and 038-3346rev1, without the need of welding or adhesives, will satisfy the project requirements.

Except as amended herein, all other terams and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. FOR:  
Battlefield Air Operations Kit - Battlefield Air Targeting Man-Aided Knowledge (BAO/BATMAN) Advanced Technology Demonstration

for a future contract under BAA-07-07-HE. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/HECB), Human Effectiveness Directorate, Warfighter Interface Division, Battlespace Acoustics Branch seeks potential sources for a forty-eight (48) month, $3.5M program to address highly unique and innovative Research and Development (R&D) concept areas in the BATMAN ATD.  Proposed work should address each of these concept areas:   Head-Mounted Displays; Tactical Communication; Wearable Computing; Wireless Systems (Data & Power); Cable Management; BAO Human Machine Interface; Speech Recognition and Physiological Monitor.  Base support will be provided in the form of access to laboratories in Building 441 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  Foreign firms will be excluded from participation in this effort at the prime contractor level.  The requirement of a security clearance is not anticipated for this effort.  

BATMAN is an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  It is part of the Battlefield Airman Operation (BAO) Kit tasked with streamlining Information Management and enhancing ergonomics for the BAO Kit.  The objectives of the BATMAN ATD are to streamline the number of displays the Combat Controller needs to have to clandestinely navigate, sense, map, reconnoiter, and target behind enemy lines.  Heavy emphasis is placed on providing ergonomic feedback into the development of BAO equipment and will utilize Human Systems Integration (HIS) concepts to create software and hardware applications.  The main goals are to achieve enhanced information management and ergonomic design.  Secondarily, the program seeks to reduce weight, reduce errors and increase speed.

This effort will involve the following:

1.  The Head-Mounted Displays research area conducts research and develops technologies that demonstrate optimum visual information transfer to the warfighter, to promote battle space awareness and combat effectiveness.  

2.  Tactical Communication research area conducts research and develops technologies that demonstrate the optimum audio information transfer to the warfighter, to promote battle space awareness and combat effectiveness.  

3.  Wearable Computing research area conducts research and develops technologies and procedures that demonstrate and evaluate the optimum integration of crew system control and display technologies.  

4.  Wireless Systems research area conducts research and develops technologies to optimize operator performance over a man-worn system, to reduce weight and cabling.  

5.  Cable Management research area conducts research and develops technologies that demonstrate optimum interface technology that revolutionizes human-machine collaboration in a man-worn system. 

6.  BAO Human Machine Interface research area conducts research and develops technologies and procedures that demonstrate and evaluate revolutionary interface  and load bearing systems to optimize the performance and safety of Combat Control personnel.   

7.  Speech Recognition research area conducts research and develops technologies and procedures that demonstrate and evaluate optimum interface technology that revolutionizes human-human and human-machine collaboration in a network-centric warfare environment. 

8.  Physiological Monitor research area conducts research and develops technologies, models and simulations to optimize operator performance across the battle space. 

9.  Software Controls research area conducts research and develops technologies and procedures that demonstrate and evaluate optimum software interface technology that revolutionizes human-machine collaboration.

<DESC>The Government has a requirement for a strategic partner for Operational Test and Evaluation Support for the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA), Quantico, VA.  This Sources Sought Notice is issued to notify vendors that are capable of providing the support identified in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and give the vendors an opportunity to ask questions and provide comments concerning the Draft SOW.  One of the assumptions made by the Government Team is due to the complexity of the multiple commodities tested by MCOTEA and the broad spectrum of required technical specialties, this effort cannot be completed by a single vendor.  Therefore, a teaming approach is encouraged. This is also an opportunity to provide potential offerors an opportunity to request a Government Advisory Opinion regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI).  The vendors are encouraged to review Title 10, US Code Section 2399, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 prior to responding concerning an OCI.  The vendor must describe the specific work performed and the duration thereof as either prime or subcontractor.  The vendor must state whether or not it considers its involvement an organizational conflict of interest prohibited by the referenced statute and regulation or an appearance of such a conflict that could adversely impact the test and evaluation mission.   The Government  anticipates making an award based on a teaming approach on a Full and Open Competition Basis with a percentage set-aside for a Small Business.  The anticipated performance period is a one- year base period with four one-year options. The Contract Type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indifinite Quantitiy (IDIQ) contract with both Cost Reimbursable and Firm Fixed Priced task orders issued referred to as Task Action Plans (TAPs).   The contractor is encouraged to provide alternatives to allow for the Government to be co-located with the Contractor Staff support. The Government intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) on or about June 7, 2007 with a Pre-solicitation Conference scheduled to be conducted at Quantico Marine Base, VA on or about June 18, 2007.  In preparation for the conference, questions and comments on the DRFP will be encouraged.  This is not an RFP and vendors should not submit formal proposals until the RFP is posted.   The anticipated NAICS Codes are 541380, 541439, 541611, 541690, 541910, 561410, and 611430.  Also please indicate if your company can be a prime contractor for this effort or, if not, whether your company can be a subcontractor.   Interested vendors may submit Concept Papers not exceeding 5 pages challenging or supporting the assumption stated above.  Please include details explaining your concept, its advantages, and overall efficiency and efficacy.  OCI concerns, and Questions or comments concerning the draft SOW and the Sources Sought Notice shall be submitted in writing, NLT 1600 EST on 21 May 2007, to the Contracting Officer at 3035 Barnett Ave, Quantico, Virginia 22134-5014 or e-mailed to lashunya.johnson-vin@usmc.mil.  Verbal questions and comments will not be entertained regarding this announcement.

This item was originally specified for use in the Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D Transmitter designed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (Unisys). Since the part was an original element of the WSR-88D design, both the part and the vendor were formally qualified during acceptance testing of the WSR-88D radar. The waveguide switch is a very reliable component and seldom requires replacement. Accordingly, few spare waveguide switches have been ordered as spares replacements over the history of the WSR-88D.  There are no other known qualified vendors who have the specifications for this part.  Specific Technical Features:  This waveguide switch must meet the requirements of MIL-S-55041, in addition to the original Source Control Drawing (SCD) No. 1213657 including:  Frequency Range, Power Handling, VSWR, Isolation, Insertion Loss, Actuating voltage, Actuating Current, Switching Time, Operating Environment (temp, humidity, altitude, etc.) to name a few. The physical dimensions and connections are also potentially unique to the WSR-88D transmitter.  The SCD also requires that any proposed part be subjected to a complete qualification under all conditions specified in the SCD. Procurement of this item is controlled under a Source Control Drawing to ensure that only qualified vendors deliver qualified parts.  Sector Microwave Industries is the only approved vendor listed on the SCD. There are no known commercially available waveguide switches that will support the requirements defined.   These items will be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is Sector Microwave Industries, Inc., 999 Grand Blvd., Deer Park, New York 11729.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Sector Microwave Industries, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified switch that provides the same fit, form and function as that specified. Any responses that  provide for a part other than that specified must be accompanied by descriptive literature and certified test results that show it meets the same form, fit and function of the part number specified (P/N SM2-641-2). Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334419.  All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  This is a government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps & Certs) process.

DUE:  4 SEPTEMBER 2007, POC:  Contract Specialist, Gail Thompson, (309) 782-5158; Procuring Contracting Officer, Mary  S. Adams (309) 782-4841; Technical, Paul Brown (812) 854-4140.  DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the MK11 Cartridge Tank.  FedBizOpps Note Number 8 applies.   The Ca rtridge Tank is manufactured from sheets stock of aluminum alloy 3003 which is deep drawn and formed into a one piece tank body approx 40 inches long with a nominal diameter of approx 4-5/8.   Two outward radial ridges are rolled, swaged, or spun into the  tank during the final phases of manufacturing the cartridge tank.   The drawn/formed body is then roll formed and crimped into a cast aluminum ring to form the body assembly.  An aluminum sheet is die formed to make a cover which is roll formed into a mat ing cast aluminum ring.  A bail is bent from approx 5/16 diameter steel rod and snapped into holes on the cover ring to finish the cover assembly.  A smaller secondary tube is deep drawn and secondary operations are used to form external radial ridges, wit h some holes and perforations being die stamped into the tube.  The smaller tube interlocks within the main tank body to form a support for the ammunition during shipping and handling.  This support tube consists of a drawn tube approx 3-3/4 diameter and approximately 14-1/2 long which has some radial flanges form by operations secondary to the drawing process.  Some holes are die punched thru the radial surface of the tube as well as some formed embossing and perforations on the closed end of the tube. An injected molded plastic sleeve is crimped into the end of the support tube to form a cradle type resting support for the intended piece of ammunition to mate up to when installed into the shipping tank.  The final assembled unit must not leak when subje cted to 5 psi of positive air pressure.   The surface finish of the final assembly is as formed, bare aluminum, no paint or secondary coating is required. The technical data package (TDP) is classified as DISTRIBUTION D limited distribution.  Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet.  The TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Ti tle 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240 ET SEQ.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25.  Offero rs MUST be registered with the US/Canada Joint Certification Office to receive a copy of the top drawing of the TDP (see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  After receipt of required certification, request a copy of the top drawing vi a email from gail.thompson2@us.army.mil.  Request must include Cage Code, Company Name, Address, Phone, Email Address and Point of Contact.  A respondent to this Market Survey must have available  manufacturing capabilities as follows: It is conceivable that the tank can be manufactured by many types of commercial metal forming, drawing, spinning or general metal fabrication type companies.  Many features on the final part could possibly be formed by several different fabrication methods  depending on the size and type of equipment available at that particular facility.    Specific production facilities required include:   Deep drawing equipment capable of drawing initial aluminum body blanks approx 42 inches long with wall thicknesses of approximately 0.1.   Various metal forming rollers, forming dies, swaging machines as well as heat treating equipment needed to provide the necessary secondary forming functions of the drawn tube blanks.   Foundry facilities/capabilities to cast parts wit h relatively tight to lerances will need to be available to provide the locking ring components of the tanks and cover assemblies.  Die stamping/punching equipment of moderate size is required to form components and/or provide platforms to do various secondary operations on.  Skills required to produce the cartridge tanks include: press operators, heat treat expertise; quench temper/annealing to obtain ductility and hardness requirements of the secondary forming processes; metallurgist to test raw materials and identify or tro uble shoot imperfections found during the drawing forming processes; certified inspectors; quality control engineers; design engineers; die designers and fabricators; and skills needed to maintain the equipment and facilities.   The general process of maki ng a cartridge case is: blanks are cut from stock sheets, then a series of drawing, stamping and secondary forming processes are coupled with heat treat operations to form the tank body and support tube.  These main components are coupled with other second ary cast, bent formed; die punched and molded components to form the final assembled cartridge tank.  A respondents capacity must be sufficient to manufacture approximately 20,000 Cartridge Tanks within a year after award of contract. Interested US/Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the MK11 Cartridge Tank are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companys capabilities, including a brief description of equipment, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria.  Information MUST be submitted to HQ, ASC, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-M, GAIL Thompson, BLDG 350, 6TH FLOOR, POLE E-10, 1 ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, ROCK ISLAND, IL 61299-6500.  Pl ease respond NO LATER THAN 4 SEPTEMBER 2007 and identify MK11 CARTRIDGE TANK SOURCES SOUGHT/MARKET RESEARCH, W52P1J-07-R-0133 as the subject of your response.  A follow-up detailed questionnaire may be requested from survey respondents.  This is a market s urvey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this market survey or otherwise pay for the information so licited.  The information you provide will only be used by ASC in developing its acquisition approach for future requirements.

<SUBJECT>D -- Intent to Sole Source to Clearwell Systems, Inc.
<DESC>ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIONS (OI), THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO CLEARWELL SYSTEMS, INC LOCATED AT 2901 TASMAN DRIVE SUITE 100 SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA 95054-1137. THE PURPOSE IS TO PURCHASE THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS FOR A ONE YEAR PERIOD: (1) EMAIL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM ?SERVER UPGRADE; (2) ADDITIONAL ANNUAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE FOR SERVER; (3) UPGRADE SEARCH ONLY LICENSE FROM 75GB TO 150GB; (4)ANNUAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE; (5) EMAIL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM WITH APPLIANCE AND SEARCH ONLY LICENSE UP TO 150 GB; (6) ANNUAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE. 


DUE TO THE EVER INCREASING AMOUNT OF ELECTRONIC DATA, IN PARTICULAR, E-MAIL, WHICH IS OBTAINED PURSUANT TO OI?S CRIMINAL, CIVIL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS, THE OI, SEIZED COMPUTER EVIDENCE RECOVERY STAFF (SCERS) IS FINDING IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO SIFT THROUGH THE DATA AND PROVIDE USEFUL RESULTS TO CASE AGENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. CURRENT E-MAIL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES REQUIRE TIME CONSUMING SEARCHES OF INDIVIDUAL E-MAIL ACCOUNTS WHICH MUST BE MANUALLY LINKED FROM ONE E-MAIL ACCOUNT TO THE NEXT.  


TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTFALL, OI WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT A SOFWARE SOLUTION THAT IS CAPABLE OF ANALYZING MULITPLE E-MAIL ACCOUNTS, CAN ASSOCIATE/LINK E-MAILS CONTAINED IN MULITPLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON BOTH CONTENT AND METADATA, IS SERVER BASED, HAS AN EASY TO USE WEB INTERFACE, AND CAN LOG ACTIONS SO AS TO EASILY IDENTIFY AND REPLICATE SEARCH METHODS USED.


IN EARLY 2006, SCERS PURCHASED 2 COPIES OF CLEARWELL SYSTEM INC'S STANDALONE E-MAIL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE WAS PURCHASED TO COMPLETE E-MAIL ANALYSIS FOR AN INVESTIGATION REQUIRING THE CASE AGENT TO SORT THROUGH LARGE AMOUNTS OF E-MAIL DATA. THE CASE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY SUCCESSFUL USING THE STAND-ALONE VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE. SINCE THE INITIAL PROCUREMENT, THE STAND-ALONE UNITS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO AIDE IN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS. HOWEVER, SINCE EACH LICENSE IS INSTALLED ON A STAND-ALONE LAPTOP, OIG IS UNABLE TO USE EACH LICENSE FOR ANY MORE THAN ONE CASE AT A TIME AND ONE AGENT AT A TIME. BY TAKING THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM A STAND-ALONE VERSION TO A SERVER BASED SOLUTION, OIG CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. IT WILL ALLOW UP TO 3 INVESTIGATIONS PER LICENSE AND WILL ALLOW MULTIPLE AGENTS TO CONDUCT SEARCH/ANALYSIS ON AN INVESTIGATION FROM ANYWHERE WITHIN OIG WITHOUT REQUIRING UNITS TO BE SHOPPED FORM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT.  IN ADDITION TO THE 2 UPGRADES BEING REQUESTED, OI WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A THIRD LICENSE TO ESTABLISH AN INITIAL OPERATIONG CAPABILITY ALLOWING UP TO 9 INVESTIGATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED AT A TIME.


CLEARWELL IS THE ONLY COMPANY TO PROVIDE DISCUSSION THREADS TO LINK TOGETHER ALL RELATED MESSAGES INTO CHRONOLOGICAL THREADS WHICH CAPTURE THE ENTIRE EMAIL DISCUSSION. THIS ENABLES AGENTS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY INFORMATION FOR THEIR CASE INSTAEAD OF SIFTING THROUGH A LOT OF FALSE POSITIVES.


INTERESTED CONCERNS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS TO THE ONES INDENTFIED IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH MAY SUBMIT A CAPABILITY STATEMENT OUTLINING THEIR PRODUCTS AND THE CONTENT OF THOSE PRODUCTS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE EVALUTATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. FOLLOWING EVALUATION OF CAPABLILITY STATEMENTS, A DETERMINDATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS REQUIREMENT IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. IF NO RESPONSES ARE RECEIVED WITHIN 10 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS SYNOPSIS, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER SHALL PROCEED WITH AWARD TO CLEARWELL SYSTEMS, INC.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT/SOURCES SOUGHT
STREAMLINED COMPETITION DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT IN FEDBIZOPPS

D-OMB Circular A-76:  Department of Defense Public-Private Competition of the Engine Management performed by United States Air Force located at Dover AFB, DE; Dyess AFB, TX; Fairchild AFB, WA; Grand Forks AFB, ND; MacDill AFB, FL; McConnell AFB, KS; Pope AFB, NC; and Travis AFB, CA.

Document Type:  Special Notice
POC:  Rickey T. Mabry
Classification Code:  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 488190.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  This synopsis is issued for information and planning purposes only.  The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this source sought notice.    

The Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) has reached an initial performance decision for the Command-wide Engine Management function.  Competition between the Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) and the cost of private sector performance determined contract performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  

On 23 April 07, HQ USAF/A1MS approved AMC?s request to conduct a Streamlined Competition.  In accordance with Air Force policy, the study must reach a performance decision, to retain in-house or convert to contract, within 90 days from the public announcement date of 02 May 07.  During this 90-day period the Government conducted market research to develop an estimated contract price.  This estimated contract price was then compared to the ACE in order to determine the most cost efficient method of operation.  This comparison deemed contractor performance more cost efficient.  However, before a contract can be awarded, the Government must verify via typical acquisition procedures that contractor costs are indeed cheaper than the Government?s ACE.  If the contract price is higher, the solicitation will be cancelled and the authorizations converted to civilian for Most Efficient Organization (MEO) performance.  

The Air Force is also conducting market research to determine capability and interest of commercial firms in performing the Engine Management function at Dover AFB, DE; Dyess AFB, TX; Fairchild AFB, WA; Grand Forks AFB, ND; MacDill AFB, FL; McConnell AFB, KS; Pope AFB, NC; and Travis AFB, CA.  The following are basic performance requirements for the Engine Management function: 

A.  Monitors removal, repair and/or replacement on assigned engines, components, and support equipment.

B.  Track specific maintenance actions on assigned engines, components, or support equipment.

C.  Monitor engine performance data on aircraft wing and test cell to include conducting research and updating engine records.

D.  Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) ? (1) conduct quarterly physical inventory of assigned engines, installed assets, and support equipment; (2) coordinate transportation requests of serviceable and unserviceable engines through the Traffic Management Office (TMO); and (3) coordinate preparation of serviceable and unserviceable assigned engines for shipment and receipt.

E.	Deployment Support ? (1) develop local engine tracking procedures and documentation methods to be used at deployed locations; (2) ensure deployed engine monitors (Government personnel) are identified and receive training to perform duties while deployed; and (3) feed engine management data from deployed location into the MIS/CEMS Area of Responsibility (AOR).

F.	Develop and implement EM operational procedures.

G.	Attend EM related meetings ? (1) attend the daily production meeting and coordinate on engine and component maintenance; and (2) attend weekly squadron staff meeting.

H.	Perform EM training, attend annual CEMS conference, and coordinate with overseas installations regarding EM functions, procedures, etc.

Request interested contractors submit a capability package to include the following information:  (1)  Name and address of company; (2) Business Size (Large, Small, disadvantaged, HUBZone, or women owned, etc); (3) Company Point of Contact to include telephone number, fax number and e-mail address; (4) Contract references relating to Engine Management Services to include: Contract Number; agency supported, whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor, period of performance, original contract value, final or current contract value, technical monitor and phone/fax number, POC with current phone/fax number, and a brief description of the effort; and (5)  Information demonstrating the company?s ability to perform engine management services as described above.   Please limit the capability package to 20 pages.  Additionally, the Government is interested in determining the practices of firms engaged in providing engine management services such as terms of warranties, buyer financing, maintenance and packaging, marking, and quality control/assurance.  Your submission must be clear, concise, and complete and submitted by COB 31 Aug 07 via e-mail to rickey.mabry@scott.af.mil.

It is anticipated that the period of performance will be a basic year plus four one-year option periods.  For purposes of this synopsis the small business size standard is $6.5M and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190.

<SUBJECT>B -- Supplement Safety Surveillance Project
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a follow on purchase order to the University of California at San Francisco. this is NOT a request for competitive quotes. The purchase order will be made on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the following services. This order will support FDA in the dietary supplement safety surveillance project. 

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The contractor shall work very closely with the project officer throughout the project. The contractor shall: Through a 6-month purchase order with the FDA, operate a dietary supplement safety surveillance program (DDSSP) for investigating of adverse health effects in individuals using dietary supplements. The goal is to apply a consistent, objective approach to evaluate reported adverse effects in order to be able to determine whether the event was related to the exposure (causation or association) and also to monitor trends in dietary supplement adverse event reporting. Our experience with the project they have recently computed provided us guidance on enhancements to improve the timeliness of case identification and ensure through follow-up for clinical and analytical data. The project will include the following objectives. 1) Monitor all calls made to 2 divisions of the CPCS hotline that involve dietary supplements, and collect cases that involve symptoms for prompt, follow-up and investigation. This doubles the catchments region for cases, and will include cases from distinct geographic segments of the state (Northern and Southern California). The ultimate goal is to incorporate the projects into all 4 divisions of the CPCS (serving the entire state of California). The second enhancement is the utilization of the CPCS module by the hotline staff to facilitate timely recognition of cases, notification of medical back-up, and case follow-up. 2) Carry out comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation of reported events to obtain reliable and accurate data in a timely manner, including product analysis and biological fluid testing in our clinical laboratory, if appropriate. 3) Conduct quarterly peer-review sessions with a multi-disciplinary team to review incidents of serious adverse events and determine causation based on a validated causation assessment scale. The team will be expanded to include participation by the U.S. FDA for an added perspective and insight. 4) Provide quarterly reports and analysis of finding on adverse events to the FDA. The analysis may include comparative prevalence data on the particular ADR for the general population and any other data on associations with the product or ingredient. 5) Notify the FDA within 72 hours of a serious sentinel adverse event related to a dietary supplement that may be a signal of a new health risk or a highly injurious supplement product. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: September 2, 2007 ? March 2, 2008.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow-Up of the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children w/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA)
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, one award to each of the seven clinical sites indentified as the MTA Group.  The MTA Group consists of the following:  (1) NYU Child Study Center, NY, NY; (2) New York State Psychiatric Institute, NY, NY; (3) University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA; (4) University of Pittsburgh, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA; (5) University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA; (6) McGill University, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada and (7) Duke University, Durham, NC.
Each award will consist of three base years and two, twelve-month option years.  These contracts will allow for extended follow-up on the subjects who participated in the initial MTA study and the normative control group by providing for the collection of follow-up data; the transfer of that data to a data management center; and recommendations about which statistical analysis to conduct on the follow-up data collected.  As ADHD is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, it is important to collect long-term data on the effects of treatment.  The MTA Group offers a unique opportunity because it contains a large number of well diagnosed and characterized children who were randomly assigned to receive different treatments for an extended period of time, and a matched control group, at different geographical sites.  
The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the MTA Group or 7 sites) is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and HHSAR 306-302-1(a)(2)(ii). The MTA Group has unique capabilities to perform the services required by this acquisition.  Foremost, this Group has access to a large number of children who have been treated for ADHD in a controlled trial.  Over the past eight years, these sites have worked to recruit, evaluate and treat a large sample of children with ADHD, a matched control group and their families. The investigators, at these sites, have established and successfully maintained over the years therapeutic relationships with these families and their children.  The investigators have remained in contact with most of the study participants through periodic re-evaluations.  Considering the unique personal and treatment relationships that have been established over time between the investigators and these families, it is not feasible to have another contractor go through the process of establishing new working relationships with these families in order to collect the necessary follow-up data.  Based on historical data from other studies, it is known that a large number of families would not participate in a non-treatment follow-up study if the follow-up study is conducted by a contractor who had not been directly involved in their initial treatment. This would result in decreasing the amount of data collected and compromise the statistical validity of the follow-up study.  Based on these considerations, it is determined that a full and open competitive award is not deemed to be in the Government's best interest for this acquisition. See Number Note 22.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to:  Roshawn Simpson, Contract Specialist, via email: rsimpson@nida.nih.gov.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service  located in Seattle, WA  on a sole source basis with Dr. Jane Anderson of  Auckland Uniservices Limited in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c) (1) one responsible source. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Purpose of proposed contract is for services to develop regional guidance on experimental design and experimental analysis of restoration actions, including the application of modern statistical techniques to current management actions to improve recovery planning. The motivating component of this work is providing an informational guidance resource for the design, execution and assessment of habitat restoration effectiveness monitoring.  The work described is to synthesize available information and identify tactics to build on existing activities to improve inferential power. Specific tasks include: 1.Develop a practical key to identify what analytical designs are available given the existing and planned restoration actions. For each potential design identified in 1. define the analytical protocol that is most appropriate for demonstrating and expressing project effectiveness.  This task will be largely a synthesis of available information from published sources.3. For each potential design identified in1, define the analytical protocol that is most appropriate for the data types used in current monitoring activities.  In many cases available analytical techniques (identified in 1) will be based on assumptions of error structures in the data that are violated by the data in common use.  Examples include categorical data that deviate from normal distributions.  For each potential design identified in 1. identify the most economical tactic for improving inferential power.  In some cases the inference can be improved with increased replication, while in others the inference can be improved more economically by monitoring for a longer duration.  The consequences of these adaptive design changes will be identified. Dr. Jane Anderson has a publication track record that has focused on the application of mathematical statistics to the problem of human disturbance ecology and impact assessment which is a critical criteria for satisfying the technical specifications of this project. She is the author of PERMANOVA, a commercialized statistical software product that is unique in addressing data that fails to meet 6the assumptions of commonly used statistical method.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has identified the need for a Contractor to provide group retirement and financial planning training on the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS).

The Contractor shall be responsible for training participants on a varied range of topics covering basic retirement eligibility, employee benefits, and the financial aspects of retirement.  Topics covered during these sessions shall be geared toward providing the participants with the necessary resources to make well-informed decisions on issues crucial to retirement and financial planning.

The Contractor shall allot time at the end of each session for answering employee questions.  The CFTC anticipates that there will be a maximum of 30 participants in each 2-day session.  The contractor shall provide materials for 30 attendees per session.  The CFTC anticipates (but does not guarantee) the need for a total of fourteen (14) 2-day training sessions (i.e. 28 days) during the base year of this contract. The specific dates for each of the sessions will be determined by the CFTC Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) with the contractor.  The Contractor shall discuss with the CFTC COTR, the course schedule, syllabus, methodologies, and background information about the audience and the Commission prior to conducting the training.

Travel:  The CFTC will not provide reimbursement for local travel expenses (i.e. metro, mileage, parking, taxi fares, etc) of companies that are located within the commuting area (50 mile radius) of where they are providing services  (e.g., if the company is located in Washington, DC, local travel expenses will not be paid when providing services at the DC Headquarters office).  The contractor shall be responsible for making his/her own travel arrangements for travel to the CFTC offices.  Travel costs shall be reimbursed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations and the clause entitled ?Travel? outlined above.  Government Responsibilities:  The CFTC will handle conference room arrangements for the training/counseling sessions, including obtaining a telephone with a dedicated number for the contractor at the Washington, DC Headquarters location, and will advertise the training/counseling sessions to employees through various means.

This solicitation number, DOL072J10045 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are incorporated through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541511.The Department of Labor?s Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index (PPI) is seeking a contractor to provide data and services to aid in constructing an output price index for new warehouse construction in the United States.

Services will include the development of four detailed regional warehouse models.  The contract length will be two years. If your company is interested in this requirement, contact Vanessa Reynolds for a Statement of Work at reynolds.vanessa@bls.gov. Please submit a technical and cost proposal no later than August 23, 2007, at 3:00PM ET .  Questions should be submitted to the same email address and must be received no later than August 9, 2007 at 3:00PM ET.  The Technical Proposal should not exceed 40 pages, plus resumes and attachments.  All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria.  The BLS will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive/responsible offeror whose offer to this solicitation is the most advantageous to the Government.  The anticipated award date is September 14, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be evaluated by BLS. Technical Proposals must contain the following information:

1.  Name of: (a) project leader (b) person(s) directly responsible for model development, (c) person(s) responsible for completing quarterly cost updates, and (d) person(s) directly responsible for answering questions.

2.  A description of the source data to be used to satisfy deliverable 1 as shown in the Statement of Work.  The description should include where and how the information is collected, the frequency of collection, and the scope.  The description should also state how the data are verified.

3.  The number of records that would be provided to BLS to satisfy deliverable 1.

4.  A complete listing of the individual fields (which make up a single record) that the offeror is able to provide information for to satisfy deliverable 1.

5.  An example of 20 project records in the vendor?s database that would be used to satisfy deliverable 1.  This should be provided in a Microsoft Excel format with each row being a single project record.

6.  A list of any additional fields not specifically requested by BLS for deliverable 1 but which the offeror believes might be important to include in each project record.  

7.  A description of the proposed methodology to be used by the offeror to select specific assemblies/components not imposed by BLS for inclusion and which represent current ?typical? construction practices.

8.  A description of the origin and scope of all primary and secondary source data that will be used to satisfy deliverable number 5 (cost updates) as stated in the Statement of Work.  Primary data sources are those directly surveyed by the vendor.  Secondary data sources are those surveyed by anyone other than the vendor.  If no secondary sources of data are used please state that explicitly.  Information must include: the total number of discrete materials for which costs are directly collected in the vendor?s cost surveys, the number of survey respondents participating in the vendor?s survey, the frequency of survey respondent contacts, and the average number of survey respondents per state.  The description should also state how the data are verified, validated, and, if applicable, modified.

9.  A description of how data in the offeror?s cost surveys are gathered and verified.

10.  A description of the proposed methodology to update the model costs on a quarterly basis.  The proposal should explain in detail how the update process would occur and describe the basis for updating the costs.  If both primary and secondary source data are to be utilized explain any differences between how each is used.  If there is no difference then state that explicitly.  The description must explain how the costs will be regionalized.

11.  A description of how the percentage changes between cost updates for individual assemblies and the building as a whole are expected to compare against secondary sources of price movement for the same time period.  For example, a description might state, ?The percentage change from one cost update to the next for each assembly is expected to very similar to the movement seen in secondary source data.?  Another example might be, ?The percentage change from one cost update to the next will exhibit a lag when compared to secondary sources due to the cost data from our survey respondents being reported on a 2-month lag.?

12.  Since the cost updates are intended to accurately reflect current market material, labor, and equipment price trends for the assemblies and the building as a whole, provide a summary narrative explaining why the proposed cost update methodology is the best method to capture this.

Offeror?s must provide three Past Performance references.  Please include Contract Number, technical and contracting points-of-contact including phone numbers and email addresses.  Past performance references should be similar in nature within the last five years.
 BLS will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria:

?	Scope and completeness of available project data to satisfy deliverable 1.
?	Clear and objective methodology for detailing warehouse models.
?	Proposed cost update methodology reflects actual cost changes observed in the market place.
?	Scope of survey used to gather current cost data.
?	Past Performance

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339999 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  This requirement is 100% small set-aside for small business.  The non-manufacturer rule applies to this procurement.  Therefore, both the seller and the manufacturer of the quoted system are required to be small businesses under the NAICS code identified above. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One Cryogenic Probe Station with a Vertical Magnet Field.*** 

BACKGROUND
The cryogenic probe station enables high-throughput electrical testing of various devices. Specifically, according to the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology?s mission, it will be used for testing novel nanodevices. Nanoscale devices can be extremely sensitive to particular configurations of a small number of atoms, impurities etc. The probe station is the only solution to enable acquisition of statistically significant datasets on many devices within an acceptable time frame. The electrical characterization within a broad temperature range from 4.2 to 400 K is necessary to determine the conductance mechanisms and to extract the information about the energy levels in the devices. One of the probe arms is required to be upgraded to guide light to the sample area to perform photo-conductance and photovoltaics characterization. The magnet built into the probe station provides a vertical magnetic field up to 2.5 T. This newest option recently appearing on the market significantly expands the versatility of the system. The probe station can be used now for high-throughput Hall and magneto-transport measurements to obtain the information about the mobility and the electron density in thin-film samples. Particularly relevant to the Center mission is the magneto-transport characterization and optimization of the growth parameters of the ultra-thin (single monolayer or a few monolayers) graphene samples.

FUNCTION OF EQUIPMENT
Vacuum probe station operation in 4.2-400 K temperature range with 6 probe arms and 2.5 T vertical magnet field with fast sample turn-around  times (<3hr). The minimal requirement is 6 arms: 4 arms are needed for magneto-transport measurement, one probe arm is to be modified for fiber optics to transmit or receive light or IR/UV radiation, and an additional arm to enable further experimental flexibility.  one arm is an ?extra? as the measurement probes can be easily damaged during the experiment.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the number of days for training and clarify training requirements as follows: 

Instead of the four or five day training requirement with a 30 hour minimum, the solicitation is amended to a three or four day training requirement with a 24 hour minimum.

The 2nd, 3rd and 4th days the students teach from the FRA & FRO lesson plans supplied by the CG and the contractor provides instructional guidance in proper teaching techniques as the students instruct each other.  The contractor also provides technical assistance concerning the subject matter that the students are instructing (FRA/FRO). The scenarios mentioned in the Terminal Objectives would also be supplied by the CG.  The contractor should have at least two instructors available at all times to facilitate the training.
