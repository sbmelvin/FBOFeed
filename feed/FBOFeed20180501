Deckman is the only known vendor who can successfully complete this requirement. NIOSH Morgantown began installing Distech Controllers and Phoenix Celeris 2 valves in the laboratories to resolve the issue of existing control equipment becoming obsolete. This procurement expands existing, proprietary controls systems, therefore, no other products/ services were considered. No other vendors are capable of completing this necessary upgrade. The system requires this upgrade to operate efficiently with minimal outages. This upgrade is critical in allowing uninterrupted research for programs on site. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at kwp9@cdc.gov by 15 May 2018.</p>

<p>This contract will facilitate the continued development and operations &amp; maintenance support needs of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics/Data Management Division (RAAS/DMD) CDW Knowledge Graph Environment (CKGE). CKGE provides critical graph research and analytics resources for investigators and research analysts. This contract will provide necessary consulting and professional services to maintain an existing environment, develop additional analytical features, and help IRS staff become more knowledgeable and skilled in the capabilities of the CKGE.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The CKGE is the result of a collaboration between t DMD and Data Exploration &amp; Testing (DET) divisions of RAAS. CKGE has successfully helped evolve the analytical capabilities of related entities using a framework of open-source software capabilities to strive for cost- effectiveness and enhance expanded benefits from flexibility to integrated several different linked-data sources.<br />RAAS plans to continue to leverage the CKGE's linked-data and graph related capabilities for use by the IRS research &amp; analytics community, which currently focuses on fraud related case work by Exam and Collection during filing and post-filing seasons. Prior work using the CKGE has shown benefits for investigators in a variety of units, such as Fraud Operations, EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) preparer compliance, Exam, Collection, CI (Criminal<br /><br />Investigation), and RICS (Return Integrity and Compliance Services). Principally, the environment will continue to facilitate a range of investigator and research graph-type analyses. As of October 2017, the CKGE is utilized by more than 300 employees throughout the IRS, with dozens of new users onboarding monthly.</p>
<p>The CKGE framework includes a graph database:</p>
<p>elastic search capabilities; java-script based, user-interface; and micro- services components. These enable useful for supporting graph- related research.<br />RAAS does not intend to alter this framework.</p>
<p>CKGE includes two specially designed features that require maintenance and expansion as the CKGE functionality continues to grow. The first is a Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) related module existing within the framework, which has been specially designed and requires maintenance and enhancements. The second is functionality to support Section 508 compliance which ensures accessibility to the CKGE data and features.<br />CKGE relies on large and varied amounts of data extracted from DMD's Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW), which represents a diverse set of tax administration data sets. Existing extracts, transform and load processes must be evaluated and updated to leverage a variety of available tools that exist within the CKGE and peripheral technologies such as a Hadoop/Spark cluster.</p>
<p>DMD also manages another legacy graph environment, yK1, that is scheduled to be integrated into the CKGE. yK1 has existing Oracle data storage, extract transform and load procedures, and a user-Interface that will be part of the integration into the CKGE.</p>
<p>Scope of Work &amp; Description of Tasks</p>
<p>1. Orientation and Ramp-Up Knowledge Transfer: The vendor shall acquire and review the necessary documentation, information, and processes related to any work in progress.

The Government will also assess the offerors level of innovation in its approach to recruit as well as retain skilled workforce. In addition, the offerors contingency plan detailing how unaccepted or plan absences of staff will be handled to maintain the level of coverage required for this acquisition will be evaluated.</p>
<p>The offeror shall describe its quality control plan which illustrates a planned systematic approach to checking the technical and contractual requirements against the resulting products or services produced during performance.</p>
<p>Factor 6: Price</p>
<p>1) The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposal using price analysis to assess the completeness of the proposal. A separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing or consideration of small business pricing may not be necessary because the GSA Schedule Program Agency has already determined the prices of items under GSA schedules to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>2) Travel Costs: Travel will not be reimbursed</p>
<p>3) An Offeror's proposed price will be determined by adding up the proposed price for each Contract Line Item (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for the base and option year(s). Price evaluation will document the completeness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Options: The Government may determine that the offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options should not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />2. Ratings: Each proposal sub factor will be assigned a rating, which will not be rolled up to an overall rating for the factor. Technical ratings focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the Offeror's proposal. Technical rating shall be evaluated using the following ratings.</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />Exceptional Exceeds minimum performance or capability requirements for acceptable contract performance<br />Acceptable Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance<br />Marginal Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance, but any proposal inadequacies are correctable<br />Unacceptable Fails to meet specified minimum performance capability requirements. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable</p>
<p>Place of Performance</p>
<p>&#9642; 77 K Street NE; Washington, DC 20002<br />&#9642; Other as approved by the Government Period of Performance</p>
<p>Base Year: Date of Award - 3/11/2019 Option Year 1: 03/12/2019 - 3/11/2020 Option Year 2: 03/12/2020 - 3/11/2021<br />Option Year 3: 03/12/2021 - 3/11/2022 Option Year 4: 03/12/2022 - 3/11/2023<br /><br />Government Furnished Property (GFP)</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis notice for installation of an electronic security system (ESS) in Buildings 903, 902, 135N, and 103 located at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.  

The procuring contracting office is NAVFAC Southeast, Bldg. 903, P.O. Box 30, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, FL  32212. The primary point of contact is Courtney Peterson, Contract Specialist, (904) 542-8815.

The proposed solicitation number is N69450-18-Q-1712.

This work includes, but is not limited to all labor, material, equipment, transportation and supervision necessary to install an ESS in Buildings 903, 902, 135N, and 103 located at NAS Jacksonville, FL.

The proposed contract type is a firm-fixed price purchase order utilizing the policies and procedures of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
  

The primary NAICS Code for this procurement is 561621 and the annual small business size standard is $20.5M.

The term of the purchase order is anticipated to be a 30 days.  There will be a 365 day warranty period.  

Market research was performed in accordance with FAR 10.002(b)(2).  As a result of the market research, the Contracting Officer recommended soliciting on an unrestricted basis under full and open competition.  In addition, the Government intends to negotiate with only an authorized Federal Lenel Value Added Reseller (VAR) under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), since installation and configuration of a system other than Lenel will void NAVFAC Southeast’s software upgrade and support plan agreement with Lenel Systems.
  The NAVFAC Southeast small business office and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Procurement Center Representative concur with the size determination.  As a result, the proposed Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on an unrestricted basis under full and open competition.  All responsible sources who are a Federal Lenel VAR, authorized to perform work for the Federal Government in Jacksonville, FL may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation.      
 
Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available. The anticipated date of RFP issuance is on or after 2 May 2018.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis toIbis Tek, Inc., CAGE Code:  1SC69, 912 Pittsburgh Rd Butler, PA, 16002-8913, for the acquisition of LCAC Armor Windows and testing report.
<p>LCAC Front, Outboard Window Assembly 4092-101-038139 1 each<br />LCAC Front, Inboard Window Assembly 4092-103-038141 1 each<br />LCAC Sidewall/Fwd, Outboard Window Assembly 4092-111-038142 1 each<br />LCAC Controller 4092-050-042827 3 each</p>
<p>10 U.S.C.<br />2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: Ibis-Tek LLC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the transparent armor (TA) used on<br />LCAC-100. The TA used in the LCAC-100 will differ from LCAC in the fact that LCAC utilizes<br />a two part window system that incorporates a waster plate (sacrificial window), where LCAC-<br />100 utilizes a single window system. They accomplish this by applying a Diamond Like Coating<br />(DLC) to the exterior of the window. The DLC is used to help with abrasion resistance due to<br />contact with windshield wipers, sand, and ice. These windows will be used for field testing<br />purposes for LCAC-100 to ensure a quality armor window is being manufactured before going<br />into full production for the LCAC-100. This will be a limited production run for field testing purposes. Support of this order will allow for a high cost savings on armor windows. Testing cost for the transparent armor window requirements would exceed $150,000 to qualify it for LCAC/LCAC-100 use if the procurement was not sole source. The requirements testing have been previously completed by Ibis-Tek LLC which will not have to be completed again if they are the sole source. Ibis-Tek LLC possesses technical knowledge for meeting the requirements to create LCAC Armor Window Assemblies to acceptable operational conditions. In summary Ibis-Tek LLC can meet the LCAC/LCAC-100 Armor Windows procurement<br />requirements within Sponsor approved funding range and the Sponsor schedule to test the windows before full rate LCAC-100 production decision, and have the marine environmental testing completed.

<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website i
