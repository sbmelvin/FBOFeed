<SUBJECT>70--Munitions Accountability System Modernization
<SOLNBR>04-CAS-0001
<CONTACT>Frank Ruff Frank.Ruff@gunter.af.mil
<DESC>Headquarters Standard System Group, Combat Ammunition System (CAS) Program Management Office is conducting market research to find if a commercial means of accounting for munitions can be attained.  CAS is a web-based system, accessed through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) that provides inventory accounting for all munitions stored and used by the United States Air Force at locations around the world.  CAS will incorporate both wholesale and retail functions.  The current CAS capability utilizes processes and procedures from the 1960s and hasn’t been updated to incorporate wireless technologies readily available in 2003.  It is web based, but only for the ability to store balances from all 45 prime sites at a central location.  Cost accounting methodology utilizes latest contract cost for all assets regardless of actual cost of individual items.  Wholesale functions have not yet been incorporated.   CAS is assumed to fall within three categories: (1) Stand-alone munitions such as bullets, grenades, etc; (2) Munitions that must be built up, such as a bomb and tail fins. Many different configurations can be built by mixing and matching components.  All components must be individually tracked even after build-up.  The end item must also be tracked by a common designation, and war planners must be able to do “what-if” exercises based on quantities of components. (3) Missiles; configuration data must be tracked—many missiles have internal components with individual shelf life and serialized control. Maintenance actions and movements must be tracked for the life of the missile.   CAS will be the sole accounting and tracking system for munitions.  From the time an item is planned for procurement at the depot until it is expended and reordered, CAS must account and reflect the current status.  Paperwork elimination is a primary goal and usage of the Air Force Identification Card, the PKI enabled Common Access Card (CAC), is essential.  Automated in-transit tracking is desired, using technology similar to “On-Star”, for example.  Serialized control is required for all items with unit cost exceeding $500 for accounting and maintenance (TCTO) actions.  Storage and shipment require edits to assure maximum net explosive weights and explosive material compatibilities are not violated.  Expenditure updates upon release from bomb bays/wings (when in the clear) is desirable; however the ability to scan aircraft and update launch-load records upon return is acceptable.   Continued incorporation of CAS into GCSS is required.  CAS must be able to be used anyplace in the world utilizing ruggedized equipment with either commercial or military web access. Autonomous operations must be able to take place in the event connectivity is broken with automatic update upon reconnect. The updated CAS must be simple, take advantage of common operator knowledge and have a simplified user interface including set-up and operation.    Interested vendors should submit their capabilities information via email to gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil or mail to: HQ SSG/PK, 490 East Moore Drive, Suite 270 (Bldg. 892), Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3004.   The capabilities information should show what can be done to achieve CAS roadmap and should address any significant foreseen risks.  There are no pre-conceived restrictions on design.  The information should include a graphical prototype and a description of the concept in 10 pages or less. Please specify whether the firm is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Also, specify if the firm is U.S. or foreign-owned.  All responses should be received on or before COB 5 November 2003.  This is a request for information only.  No solicitation will be generated or contract awarded as a result of this request.   Additionally, the Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this request for information.  For specific questions, please contact Ms. Gail Sosa at 334-416-6599 or gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil.

<DESC>Availability of Solicitation The solicitation for the Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials is now available. The solicitation can be found at http://www.coe.faa.gov/ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to establish an Air Transportation Center of Excellence (COE) for Advanced Materials.

The purpose is to forge a union of public sector (FAA, airport authorities, state/local governments, etc.), private sector (airlines, manufacturers, etc.), and academic institutions to create a world-class consortium that will identify solutions for existing and anticipated advanced materials problems.  The FAA expects that the COE shall perform basic research through engineering development and prototyping. To this end, the FAA is soliciting proposals from accredited institutions of higher education addressing the establishment of the aforementioned COE. The FAA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team members and thereafter award grants and delivery order contract(s) consisting of cost reimbursement, cost sharing, and/or fixed price. The FAA intends to invest between $300,000 and $500,000 in the first year and a minimum of $300,000 per year for the next two years of the COE.

<DESC>AEFB Broad Agency Announcement FY04

A.  THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA AEFB 04-0001) FOR AIR EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BATTLELAB OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004 (1 October 2003 through 30 September 2004).

B.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concepts.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to: 
366 CONS/LGCB, marked for BAA AEFB-04-0001, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Bldg 512 Suite 498, Attn: Mrs. Terry Oakland, Mountain Home AFB ID 83648.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to terry.oakland@mountainhome.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 SEP 04.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/AEFB and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

C.  OBJECTIVE: 
(1) Technical Description: The mission of the AEF Battlelab is to rapidly identify innovative and superior solutions to plan and employ AEF capabilities, organize and train forces for AEF operations, and influence AEF doctrine and tactics in order to meet current and emerging missions.  This BAA solicits innovative concept papers addressing operational solutions to Air Force AEF needs.  Submit concept papers that address improvements within any of the phases of AEF operations (readiness, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and reconstitution).  Submissions should describe the expected benefit in terms of how the concept would reduce support structure, reduce response time, and/or increase combat capability and effectiveness of an AEF.  These concept papers may include, but are not limited to: new tactics, techniques, procedures, and technology applications that may affect Air Force doctrine and strategy.  The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of MATURE, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.  All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the AEF, given the aforementioned need.  Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the AEF Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 
(2) Security Requirements: Please contact Capt Mike Vigueria at (208) 828-3542 for any security concerns regarding the concept paper submissions.  
(3) Other Special Requirements: (a) DO NOT SUBMIT FULL PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  Proposals will be requested only if the AEFB has an interest in the concept, and funding is available for the effort.  (b) Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132.  (c) Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA.  (d) If potential offerors have received this BAA by sources other than the Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, you are not guaranteed receipt of further information related to the AEFB Program or this BAA document. 

D.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA AEFB 04-0001 with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Mrs. Terry Oakland at (208) 828-3108 or email to:  terry.oakland@mountainhome.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this program.

E.  CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.  The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.  However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Mrs. Oakland at the address in Section A of this BAA.  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; period of performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort; 
Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement that which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance Air Force AEF operations;
Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish the demonstration;
Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology; 
Section E:  Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training;  
Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration; 
Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 
Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact’s current telephone # and address.  For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.  Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and cost proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.  BASIS FOR AWARD: 
(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (a) The extent to which the proposed concept makes the Air Force lighter, leaner or more lethal, (b) impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities (Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, Agile Combat Support), (c) technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, and (d) proposed cost.  All four areas, (a) through (d), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.  
(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Nominal duration of demonstrations will be up to 18 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  The AEFB anticipates contract awards will be less than $500K.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).  Primary appropriation type:  Operations and Maintenance

<DESC>DESC: The Information Exploitation Systems (SRHD) Program Office seeks to upgrade the Eagle Vision Systems through the addition of a capability to directly receive commercial imagery from commercial satellite vendors versus the reception of direct satellite downlinks using existing commercial-off-the-shelf products.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a Request for Proposal, or Solicitation, or an indication that the Government will contract for these items.  The Government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Eagle Vision Systems currently exist or are being built to collect and process commercial satellite (SPOT, Landsat 7, Radarsat, QuickBird, IKONOS and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)) Imagery.  Eagle Vision Systems can also process national imagery. Eagle Vision Systems are composed of two elements:  a Data Acquisition Segment (DAS) and Data Integration Segment (DIS).  The DAS includes an antenna, a shelter and transit-cased processing equipment that collects and processes imagery into standard commercial formats.  The DIS processes the standard commercial format products into Controlled Image Based (CIB) formatted products for use in the combat commander's mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems.  This Virtual Terminal capability shall provide Eagle Vision operators to electronically order commercial satellite imagery directly from the satellite vendor and electronically receive the imagery at the Eagle Vision Ground Station at any worldwide location without having to directly receive the satellite transmission at the Eagle Vision Ground Station.  Eagle Vision shall have the capability to order the delivered imagery in any of the following formats:  raw imagery, level 1 or equivalent, GEOTIFF, NITF 2.1/2.0, orthorectified, mosaiced, and/or geocorrected.  Raw imagery shall include post pass ephemeris so that Eagle Vision has the necessary data to process the imagery into level 1 equivalent products. The RFI Response shall include: (1) Transmission information regarding bandwidth requirements for the submittal of imagery orders and the transmission of the imagery to Eagle Vision.  (2) Methodology to protect the ordering and dissemination of the information from/to Eagle Vision and the satellite vendor (i.e. VPN, secure network, etc).  (3) Identify any compression schemes or methodology proposed to facilitate the imagery ordering and/or dissemination process. (4) Identify all interface requirements that will be required to exchange information with the satellite vendor. (5) Define the entire process for ordering/receiving imagery to include the identification of the imagery requirements, submitting the request, order confirmation, order modification/cancellation, order statusing, order fulfillment notification (delivery notice), actual imagery delivery, and imagery receipt notification.  (6) Identify and describe any tools or processes that will be provided to be used by the Eagle Vision operators to facilitate collection planning to include order fulfillment timelines, weather, collection success prediction, etc.  (7) Order placement should be capable of being performed via e-mail, fax, and/or Internet.  (8) Define imagery delivery options to include direct delivery to Eagle Vision (push), notice to Eagle Vision to retrieve from vendor (pull), order deliver to a third party (NIMA or other organization) for push or pull delivery, and any alternative delivery methods such as overnight delivery via CD/DVD. (9) The ordering agency (i.e. Eagle Vision) cannot be disclosed to the public or associated with the imagery in the satellite vendor's database or imagery catalogue. The Virtual Terminal shall be compatible with the existing Eagle Vision system.  Interested parties are invited to provide technical information, cost of system, and describe customer base and experience providing such products.  Completion of all work is required no later than 12 months after award of the contract.  The earliest anticipated award date is March 2004.  Please provide name of your firm, address, point of contact, phone/fax, and an electronic mail address, if available.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Interested parties should provide product information meeting the above stated requirements no later than 20 days from date of this notice.  All responders are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern or woman-owned small business.  In addition, contractors will indicate whether or not their equipment and services are offered through the GSA Schedule or any other Government-wide agency contract. Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System (CCR).  The Government may solicit firms meeting the screening criteria in this synopsis.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph B. Magnone, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.

<DESC>This announcement replaces solicitation Number GS-00P-03-CYD-0113 that was originally synopsized July 11, 2003 and later cancelled in its entirety on August 5, 2003.  
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture for Supplemental Architect-Engineer/Interior Design Services for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) First Impressions Program and Related States, Nationwide.  The First Impressions program is a collaboration of the GSA and other Federal Agencies.  Building on the success of the Design Excellence program for federal buildings, this program’s mission is to enhance the public’s perception of the GSA and the federal government by improving the appearance of efficiency of GSA buildings.  These buildings belong to the American public and exist to serve them.  Public architecture forms a meaningful image in our collective imagination.  Together, we can make it the best image possible; one of an efficient, effective, and professional government.  The factors that most influence visitors’ first impressions of the building include: the approach and immediate exteriors; building lobbies and corridors; elevators; stairs and escalators; agency entrances and public concession areas.  Functional support and expertise for the First Impressions program will typically be in the areas of; transforming the building image; reducing clutter; consolidating functions; unifying signage; and streamlining security.  This procurement will establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quality (IDIQ) Contracts to provide design and related services for federal facilities; owned, leased and/or controlled nationwide.  This contract is national in scope, supporting all existing and future federal and other types of real property.  Multiple A-E contracts may be awarded.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990 and the business size  standard is $5.0 million.  Full and open competitive procedures will be unutilized.  A firm, fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the Validation of high throughput assays for  prolactin, IgG, TNF-alpha, IL-6, leptin, triglycerides, glucose and estradiol for use with fresh breast milk. STATEMENT OF WORK: A.  Background: The US Environmental Protection Agency is initiating studies to advance the current methods used in measurement of endogenous and exogenous components of  breast milk (Methods Advancement in Milk Analysis - MAMA).  The Human Studies Division of the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) (located at 104 Mason Farm Rd. Chapel Hill, NC 27514), will collect breast milk and other body fluids from 20-25 women.  This study  has received UNC IRB approval. The obtained fluids will be analyzed for 8 endogenous components, all of which have no commercial assays available for them, to determine if milk may be frozen at -20 or -80 C and retain accurate measurements of the actual input to the child (fresh sample).  The  fluids will also be used to measure the concentrations of many exogenous (environmental) components and to determine how those contaminants are partitioned throughout the body fluids. These endpoints are of interest for the development of hypotheses in the up-coming, multi-Agency endorsed, National  Children's Study.  The EPA will publish the results of this study without releasing any propriety contractor information. B. Contractor Requirements: The Contractor shall: 1.  Provide all reagents and equipment, project management and administration, and senior research technologist required to  validate assays for prolactin, immunoglobulin G, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, triglycerides, glucose, and estradiol for use with fresh breast milk. a.  Provide milk sample preparation methods for each assay b.  Determine assay precision 1.  Precision shall not exceed 15% CV;  LOQ 20% CV 2.  Use 95% confidence intervals for data evaluation c.  Determine assay accuracy using spike recovery d.  Determine assay linearity using dilusional recovery  2.  Apply time not used on quick validation of one assay toward more time consuming assays (estimated time is 200 hours) 3.   Inform Project Officer more than a week in advance of unsuccessful efforts at validation. 4.  Retain all intellectual property for the protocols used in assays developed. 5.  Provide daily transportation for samples from the UNC facility to contractor location. 6.  Measure levels of endogenous milk  components in fresh and frozen breast milk samples provided through the MAMA study following development of these reliable assays for use with milk.  All samples shall be run in duplicate.7.  Measure breast milk and serum samples from the MAMA study within 8 hours of collection. C.  Government  Responsibilities: The EPA will:  1.  The EPA will develop a reliable assay using a commercially available source for secretory immunoglobulin A and will share this data with the contractor. 2.  Provide advice or verbal assistance in troubleshooting difficult assays, if consulted. 4.  Provide the  samples from the MAMA study to the contractor by noon, plus or minus one hour, on the designated date. 5.  Publish the results from this study in a peer-reviewed journal as quickly as possible upon study completion and data analyses.   D. Reporting requirements: Validations: 1.  Provide the EPA  Project Officer with copies of raw data (duplicate values, means, SD, CV, range) and analyses proving assay validities. 2.  Provide weekly feedback on assay development via phone. Sample Analysis: 1.  Provide publication quality raw data to the EPA Project Officer within 3 weeks of analyzing the  individual samples. SELECTION CRITERIA: The EPA will select a vendor based upon both cost and technical factors so that the Agency receives the best value for this purchase with Technical, Past Performance and Price equally important.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Rachid Lazrak, Chief Executive Officer, Lazrak Management SA, 10, place Mohamed V, 20000 Casablanca, Morocco, Telephone:  (212-22) 20-33-20, Fax:  (212-22) 27-84-30, Email: cablazrak@iam.net.ma  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an international standard convention center complex in Casablanca.

Tourism and services expansion are critical to the Moroccan economy.  The Government of Morocco launched a “Vision 2010” Plan in 2001 to attract ten million visitors to the country by 2010, which would in turn create 600,000 new jobs, generate receipts of up to US$46 billion, and expand the country’s gross domestic product by twenty percent.  To demonstrate its support of Vision 2010, the government is investing 30 billion dirhams (US$2.9 billion) to support tourism projects throughout the country.

Lazrak Management SA, a private Moroccan development company, has proposed to build an international convention center complex.  In addition to the convention facilities, the complex would include one or more hotels with affiliated commercial centers, apartments, and office space.  The Moroccan Government has agreed to provide land (approximately five hectares) to the project as well as the requisite road and utility access.  Two locations for the convention center along the Casablanca waterfront are currently being considered, but the most likely site for the complex will be on the outskirts of the city alongside the access road to Mohammed V International Airport.

The study will perform the following tasks:  1) analyze market information, 2) analyze location and accessibility, 3) recommend most appropriate mixed-use complex, 4) analyze the project’s place in morocco’s tourism planning, 5) conduct economic and financial analysis, 6) conduct preliminary environmental impact assessment, 7) examine financing options, 8) conduct sensitivity analysis based on changes in business volume, and 9) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $344,752 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local Moroccan time on Monday, December 1, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is seeking sources to assist in conducting an independent compliance audit (presumed at this time to be performed using WebTrust SAS 70-Type II criteria) of its electronic commerce Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). An independent compliance audit of the DEA E-Commerce systems is needed to ensure CSOS and EPCS Policy Compliance and Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) Interoperability. 

DEA is building a Certification Authority (CA) and modifying its regulations to permit the use of PKI-based digital signature to bring the advantages of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce to the regulatory process. This process will allow controlled substance orders and prescriptions to be electronically transmitted using digital signature technology in lieu of paper processing and written signatures. This technology will be used in the Controlled Substance Ordering System (CSOS) and Electronics Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) Certification Authority. The CSOS provides manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers of controlled substances the option to digitally sign and transmit orders between trading partners, while EPCS provides for the electronic transmission of controlled substance prescriptions from practitioner to pharmacy. 

DEA has a requirement for specialized consulting /auditing services which will enable the agency to have a fully accredited Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solution. The prospective firm must be qualified to perform an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) audit and must be thoroughly familiar with requirements imposed on the issuance and management of digital certificates. The prospective firm must also perform such compliance audits as a primary responsibility. Interested sources should submit technical capabilities statements to Cynthia Miller, Contract Specialist that demonstrate their capabilities to provide the support being sought. The statement should not contain unnecessarily elaborate detail.  The Technical Capabilities should be no more than 5-10 pages in length.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Office of the Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the existing Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater utility systems located at Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) and Pittsburgh Air National Guard Base (ANGB), PA.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firms(s) will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system(s).  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  Pittsburgh ARS
Location: Pittsburgh, PA
Installation Description:  The 911th Air Wing (AW) is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, within the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP).  The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 911th AW encompasses approximately 115 acres (12 owned and 103 acres leased) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh IAP.  The 911th AW has a total of 56 buildings.
Utility systems to be privatized: 
a.	Electric:
      Exelon Energy and Duquesne Light supply the electrical power to the Pittsburgh ARS, Pittsburgh IAP, through two primary distribution lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Exelon Energy supplies 68 percent of the electricity while Duquesne Light supplies 32 percent of the required electrical power.  The primary source originates at Duquesne’s Mountour substation approximately four miles ease of the Base and delivers 17,055 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) via 22.9 kilovolt (KV) overhead transmission lines.  The primary is stepped down at the Base substation to 4.16 kV to feed the Base primary.  An alternate source begins at the Russell Burdsall and Ward substation located three miles north of the Base, and delivers 10,313 kVA through 22.9kV overhead transmission lines.  Duquesne Light’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 212).  Automatic sectionalizing switches control the two circuits, providing automatic switching capability in the event of a power outage.  A three-phase 1500kV transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160Volt (V) primary distribution for the Base.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with two 1200 Amp vacuum switches protecting two 4160V feeders.  From the substation, a combination overhead/underground system serves the majority of the base facilities.  The Base has a total of 55 buildings.  Base drawings show approximately 8,888 LF overhead cables and 15,555 LF of underground cables.  All of the PCB-contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  The system also includes the following:  (1)  59 transformers ranging from 10 kVA to 750 kVA; (2) 91 utility poles of various heights; (3) 14 switches (2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-way); and (4) 20 buildings have electric meters installed.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, the Base has programmed a Demand Side Energy Reduction initiative that will provide load shedding of building air conditioning systems when a preset demand level is reached. The substation was constructed in the mid-1950’s.  The underground circuits are newer, with construction dates ranging from the mid-1960’s to present.  Equipment such as transformers average in age from 25 years for pole-mounted and 5 years for those on pads.  The underground cables are relatively new being installed in the 1990’s; a portion of the overhead (400 area) is part of the original 1940’s installation.  The existing Duquesne-owned substation is operating at its maximum capacity, and the base-owned switchgear is weak, requiring the base to restore power incrementally after outages.  The distribution system is generally in fair condition, and the positioning of switches throughout the system provides a degree of backup from one circuit to another.  A number of utility poles require replacement, as do some of the strain reliefs.  The Base has total of 58 facilities of which 16 are metered.

b.	Natural Gas:
      Peoples Natural Gas Company supplies natural gas to the 911th AW.  Gas is brought to the Base through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe operating at 40 psi.  The 6-inch supply line enters the Base southeast of the main gate and runs parallel along Defense Avenue to the metering station located at Building 119.  At the metering station, pressure is reduced to 10 psi, and then distributed to Base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4-inches.  Thirty-six buildings have gas meters installed.  The existing 18,150 LF of pipe is polyethylene, which has been inserted in the original steel lines.  The polyethylene pipe has a tracer wire to facilitate locating this pipe.  The metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only point where pressure is reduced.  Peoples Natural Gas owns all natural gas lines and the meter and regulator system to the point of pressure reduction; 911th AW assumes ownership of the gas lines on the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Plastic isolation valves located at each building and throughout the system enable portions to be isolated for maintenance.  The system was extensively replaced in FY 1991.  No code violations were observed during the site visit, and the system is in very good condition.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Potable water is supplied to the 911th AW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 12-inch main.  The water is metered and then delivered into the distribution system through the base’s 8-insh main.  The average pressure supplied to the Base is 90 psi.  The 911th AW provides no additional treatment, and the Base has no active potable water wells.  Water storage is provided by a 1.5-million gallon elevated water storage tank, which is located on-base but owned and operated by the MTMA.  The elevated storage tank is supplied through a 16-inch main, which is also owned by MTMA.  The elevated storage tank serves both the local community and the installation, and the MTMA reserves 300,000 gallons of water exclusively for the base’s fire protection requirements.  An additional ground-level tank stores 165,000 gallons of water used only for fire protection of two flightline facilities.  The Base water distribution system is government-owned and consists of approximately 26,000 linear feet of water mains and service laterals.  The majority of the mains were upgraded in 1991 with polyvinyl chloride (PVC); the remaining original system is ductile iron.  Most of the base’s original system was abandoned in place during the upgrade.  Most of the 911th AW water lines distribution water through a looped system; however, the system has some dead-end lines.  The water distribution system is generally in excellent condition.  Flow volume is good, and system pressures are well balanced.  Pressures at the fire hydrants are consistently in the 90-100 psi range with good flow.  Vales, which are generally older than the distribution lines, are all accessible and in good operating condition.  There are no known code violations.  There are 58 facilities on the Base of which only 6 are metered.  

d.	Wastewater Collection System:
     Wastewater generated by 911th AW is carried off base through a 15-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, and disposed of through Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) sanitary sewer lines and sewage treatment facility.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the Base is billed for sewage treatment fees based upon 100 per cent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The Base system meets all known regulatory requirements, and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 911th AW wastewater collection system consists of 19,640 feet of gravity-flow vitrified clay pipe.  The collection system includes laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The Base has no lift stations and the oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  Service laterals are typically 4- to 6-inches in diameter; mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  The wastewater collection system is generally in fair condition.  Most of the system is original and has not been lined, but the base’s terrain and slopes provide for adequate flow, and base personnel report no problems with blockages or backups.

Installation:  Pittsburgh Air National Guard Base
Location:  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Installation Description:  The 171st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) installation is located at the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP) approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 171st ARW occupies 179 acres and contains approximately 51 buildings and structures.  This land is leased from the Allegheny County Department of Aviation.

Utility systems to be privatized:

a.	Electrical:
     CMS Marketing Service and Trading provides the electrical commodity to the 171st ARW through two lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Duquesne’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 101).  A three-phase, 1500 kilovolt-ampere (kVA) transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160 Volts (V) primary distribution for the base.  Electrical power for the entire base is metered at the substation.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with the switchgear.  From the substation, the system feeds the base with two separate circuits, one supplying the area west of the airfield, and the other supplying areas south and east of the airfield.  Base drawings show approximately 13,130 LF of underground secondary conductors, 4,530 LF of primary underground conductors, approximately 3,840 LF of overhead secondary conductors, and 5,740 LF of primary overhead cables.  The system also includes the following:  (1) 55 transformers ranging from 10kVA to 500 kVA; (2) 67 utility poles of various heights; (3) 22 airfield light stanchions; and (4) 3 double throw vacuum switches.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, Duquesne has the capability to remotely read the electric meter at the substation through a modem.  In addition, there are on 3 facilities of 44 that have meters.  The existing system is primarily underground, with above ground lines in a few areas.  The system varies in age from 7 to 50 years.  The underground cable was installed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conduit with concrete casings in 1992.  Most of the overhead cable is original, installed in the early 1950’s.  Transformers and associated equipment range in age from approximately 25 years for pole mounted and approximately 5 years for those on pads.  All of the underground cables and ducts, and most of the overhead cables are in good condition.  Transformers are generally in good condition, and all of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  Manholes and power poles are in good condition, although the manholes are considered confined spaces for maintenance entry and two poles have minor problems with structural loads.  The base has systematic problems with 3-phase equipment motors (such as for air conditioning compressors) burning up due to single phasing characteristics when power is intermittently lost or when restoring base power after outages.  The base is studying the installation of a 3-phase loss relay system to rectify the problem.  There are no known code violations or discrepancies.  Lli Technologies and Sergeant Electric maintain the 171st ARW electrical utilities through service contracts.  
 
b.	Natural Gas Distribution System:
CMS Marketing Services and Trading supplies natural gas to the 171st ARW through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe owned by the Peoples Natural Gas Company.  Pressure is reduced from 40 psi to 10 psi at the metering station on Cliff Mine Road and then distributed to base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4 inches.  Pipe material is a combination of black iron and polyethylene.  The Cliff Mine Road metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only regulators with shut-off valves.  Peoples owns all natural gas lines, meters, and regulators to the point of pressure reduction; the 171st ARW assumes ownership of the gas lines o the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Base drawings show approximately 9,400 LF of gas mains on-base.  Approximately 1,610 LF of steel piping was replaced in 1990 and the remaining 7,800 LF was installed in 1955.  There are no valves on the distribution system, other than those at the buildings.  The portions of the system with black iron pipe are approximately 45 years old; the polyethylene pipe is less than 10 years old.  The 171st ARW has no personnel or equipment on-base to repair breaks or leaks in the polyethylene pipe, and therefore maintains the natural gas system by service contract on an as required basis.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Water is supplied to the 171st ARW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 10-inch ductile iron main that runs beneath the runway 32-14 and the approaches to runways 28L and 28C.  The base does not own or maintain this 10-inch water line.  The base owns the supply line an distribution mains.  A single meter located near the base of the elevated water storage tank located at the 911th AW meters the main feed from MTMA.  MTMA owns and reads this meter.  Findlay Township provides a backup water source, which enters the base at the main gate and is metered in a pit near the main gate just inside the installation property.  Findlay owns and reads this meter.  After metering, the water enters the base distribution system, which is a combination of several loops, and a number of long dead-end branches.  There are no water meters installed at the facilities.  The average pressure supplies to the base is 90 psi.  The base has a 150,000 gallon storage tank which is used for fire protection only.  The 171st ARW provides not additional water treatment and the base has no active potable wells.  Including the supply lines to the base, water mains are comprised of approximately 19,419 LF of pipe, most of which is 8-inch asbestos cement that is nearly 50 years old.  The system’s dead ends do not appear to create any maintenance problems; the system balance is good, the dead ends all provide a mean for flushing, and the base reports no sediment or brown water problems.  The system’s age, however, presents several serious problems.  System repairs are difficult because of the high percentage of mains located under the airfield-parking ramp and other pavements, and the proximity of the mains to buildings and other obstacles.  The supply line running under the ramp breaks, on average, once a winter.  The system’s 55 valves are properly located for isolation purposes, but maintenance personnel estimate that only 15 of them work properly.  There are 28 fire hydrants and associated 4.5-inch valves located on base.  Hydrant-testing results reveal insufficient flow for adequate fire protection.  Since the main pipes appear to be adequately sized to meet the base’s requirements, this is likely due to the constricting effects of mineral deposits on interior pipe walls.  This assessment is based on the number of water line breaks to the system and the condition of the piping replaced or repaired.  There are no known code violations.  The foregoing problems could be corrected by replacing the base’s 6- and 8-inch mains with new 8-inch mains and changing the supply source to eliminate the main running under the ramp area.  The base has already identified two alternative recommendations to the current supply sources.  These alternatives recommend switching to Findley as the primary source (assuming they have adequate capacity) and extending a main east of the base to connect to MTMA’s distribution system near Beaver Grade Road.  This assessment was made during 1999, therefore, some of these problems may have been rectified.  The base has facility backflow preventer units installed, however, these backflow units are not part of this contract.  There are no large backflow preventers on the distribution system.  The 171st ARW maintains the water distribution system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

d.	Wastewater Collection System:  
     Wastewater generated by the 171st ARW flows off-base through a 8-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, discharged into Moon Township Municipal Authority’s (MTMA) 18-inch sanitary sewer line and treated at MTMA’s sewage treatment facility.  Base ownership ends at MTMA’s 18-inch line.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the base is billed for sewage treatment fees based on 100 percent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  The base system meets all known regulatory requirements and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 171st ARW wastewater collection system consists of primarily 7,626 feet of gravity-flow pipe.  The collection system include laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The base has one lift station with an ejector pump, which serves only Building 316.  It is new as a result of that new construction.  The lift station is only operated when there is a UTA weekend and occasionally thereafter during the year.  Service laterals are typically 3- to 6-inches in diameter, and mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  Most of the system consists of original vitrified clay pipe installed in the 1950’s.  The 171st ARW has 31 manholes.  Many of these manholes require maintenance as result of age.  The major problems are wall repairs, ring repairs, and re-grouting.  Three manholes require rising, 1 requires lowering to facilitate waste flow, and the other 27 require maintenance and repair as specified above.  The 171st ARW maintains the wastewater collection system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment 0002: RFQ 74141 dated September 12, 2003 is hereby changed as follows: 1.The turnover plan requirement is revised  as follows: PROPOSAL PREPARATION, Page 2 of 6, 1. Technical Proposal, Item 3. Management Plan, Sub-item, turnover plan.  DELETE "turnover plan" EVALUATION/AWARD, Page 4 of 6, paragraph D, Management Plan: effectiveness and efficiency. DELETE the words: "and the proposed turnover plan is feasible". 2. The following Organizational Conflict of Interest clause is added.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (a)	It is the policy of the Federal Government to avoid contract awards which could create potential conflict of interest.  Such a situation could occur in this instance when the Contractor or any Subcontractors have business, financial, real property, mineral rights, or other interests, as well as professional activities that create conflicting roles which could potentially bias a Contractor's judgment or result in unfair competitive advantage to the Contractor and thus impede the Government's objective of obtaining impartial, technically sound, and objective performance of the contract. (b) Any request for waiver from the terms of this contract provision shall be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a full description and justification of the required waiver. (c) The Contractor, or any of his officers or representatives, shall not involve himself in any situation during performance of this contract which may result in conflicts as contemplated in Paragraph (a) above.  Failure to comply with this provision may be cause for termination of this contract for default. (d) The Contractor must disclose any interest which may develop after contract award which may result in his placement in a conflicting role with his performance of this agreement.  Failure to comply with this provision may be cause for termination of this contract for default. (e) The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph in all subcontracts and consultant agreements; however, subcontractors and consultants shall be directed to send any requests for waiver to the Contractor who shall then inform the Contracting Officer as described in (a) above. 3. The Technical Proposal requirement (Page 2 of 6 of the RFQ package, Proposal Preparation, Paragraph 1. Technical Proposal), is revised as follows: "One original and three copies of the technical proposal must be submitted and must not exceed 15 pages in length, excluding copies of relevant resumes and illustrative sample requested under Item #2 below. The technical proposals must not contain any pricing data."  4. Reference Page 3 of 6, Section 2. Cost Proposal, paragraph c -- Delete the "82 hours per Pilot", as there will not be  individual ceilings.  The Level of Effort should now read "Consultation: 246 hours total." 5. The Proposal Preparation instructions are revised as follows:  "One original and three copies of the technical proposal must be submitted and must not exceed 15 pages in length, excluding copies of relevant resumes and illustrative sample requested under Item #2 below.  The technical proposals must not contain any pricing data."   This revised language will be incorporated into the Proposal Preparation, Paragraph 1. Technical Proposal, Page 2 of 6 of the RFQ package. 6. The SOW is hereby revised as follows: SOW Section II.B Assessment and Recommendations Report The first and sixth bullets are modified as follows: -A summary of the types of contracts and services procured by USAID over the past three years. -Information and lessons learned relating to successful use of PBSC by other agencies. procuring similarly challenging technical support services over the past three years. 7. The due date for proposals is hereby extended from October 10, 2003 to October 16, 2003. 8. The North American Industrial Classification Code for this project will be 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.   9. Questions received from offeror's are hereby anawered below. 10. By way of this Amendment there are no other changes to this solicitation. RFQ NO. 74141 SUMMARY OF QUESTIONS/RESPONSES  Q1.  Does US AID currently use Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) agreements?  This type of contract would allow the agency to establish terms and conditions for various types of services, and the issuance of results oriented, performance based task orders as the scope of work and deliverables can be fully defined. Yes, USAID currently issues IDIQ contracts. However, an IDIQ contract will not be used for this procurement. Q2.  US AID estimated level of effort for CLIN 0002, Three Pilot Requirements, is 82 hours per pilot.  What is the basis of this estimate?  Based on the activities required in the scope of work for this portion of the contract, a significant amount of effort is required. The estimate was prepared based on the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW). Please note that the contractor will not be responsible for generating the actual documents or the final product.(PWS, QASP, etc.)  The three Pillar Bureau pilot teams will be composed of the Contracting Officer and Program Officer(s), and they will be responsible for generating the initial draft and re-writes to incorporate the recommendations provided by the contractor.  Also, please see the response for Question #33 below. Q3.  US AID has a good guideline, "The Sourcebook" for issuing results-oriented assistance instruments.  Have the practices in that guideline been used for procurement contracts, and with what success?   No. The relationship between USAID and its recipients is much different than that between the agency and its contractors, and the relevant instruments reflect that.   Q4.Is this a new initiative? If not is there an incumbent and who is it?  There is no incumbent for services to develop an assessment or assist 3 specific pilot teams in developing and soliciting their requirements using PBSC methodology. Q5. Page 3, Scope, Period of Performance: does this time line include the assessment and pilot activities?  Yes; however, the assessment deliverables are due earlier.  Please see the additional clarification provided for Question #26 below.  Q6. Page 4, Pilot Performance - Based Services Contracts:  Where are these Pillar Bureaus located? Is the Offeror expected to work at the Pillar site?  The Pillar Bureaus are located at the Headquarters, Washington DC.  The contractor will not perform at the Pillar site; however, the Contractor will be expected to attend meetings with the Pillar Bureaus on-site as necessary and in accordance with their proposed technical approach. Q7. Page 5, 1.) A brief summary of consulting hours used per month, tracked by pilot requirement. Please explain what is meant by "tracked by pilot requirement".  During the course of this contract, 3 pilot requirements or solicitations will be developed, one for each Pillar Bureau.  This summary will indicate how many hours were spent on each Pillar Bureau pilot requirement. Q8. Page 5, "At the conclusion of each pilot" - what determines the conclusion?  Conclusion of each pilot is the contract award of each pilot requirement, as well as the Post Award Conference if scheduled by the Pillar Bureau Contracting Officer. Q9. Are subcontractors to the Offeror barred from participating on any of the pilots?  Please see the organizational conflict of interest clause which has been incorporated into the RFQ. Q10. To be successful, must a bidder have experience working with USAID and its bureaus?   No. Q11. Must the successful bidder's office be located in the Washington D.C. area?  No. However, the successful offeror must be able to attend meetings with the Pillar Bureau Teams in Washington, D.C. as necessary and in accordance with their proposed technical approach.  Q12. Will the work be done primarily in the Washington D.C. area?  See above response for Question #6. Q13. Must the individuals assigned to work the projects live in the Washington D.C. area?  No. See above response for Question #11. Q14.    SOW, page 3, II. SCOPE, A.  Statement of Objectives, 1) "detailed assessment of the various contracts instruments...".  B.  Assessment and Recommendations Report.  line 5, "Contractor may review as necessary all relevant contract data...".  line 6, "...agency's current application of PBSC concepts in current awards; line 7, "representative sampling of typical USAID requirements"; and line 11, "supplemental information".  Can USAID quantify the number and range in general terms the contract instruments, all relevant contract data, the current awards in which the PBSC methods are applied and supplemental information pertinent to the assessment and/or expected to be assessed under CLIN 0001? The amount of information to be reviewed will ultimately be determined by the contractor.   It can be assumed that there are a limited number of bona fide PBSC contracts currently active, possibly no more than 8-10.  In general, the contract types used by USAID are discussed in the SOW.  The range of development and commercial services procured by USAID include work in these major areas (as discussed athttp://www.usaid.gov/our_work/):  Agriculture, Democracy/Governance, Economic Growth and Trade, Environment, Global Health Issues including HIV work, and Humanitarian Assistance.  Several contracts representing major programs from each of these areas might be useful to review in developing an understanding of the types of services USAID normally acquires.  Some amount of "supplemental information" is available via the public website above, and as outlined in the SOW, but other information would include a limited amount of contract data reports relevant to statistics regarding types of contract awards, amounts, etc., or information gathered from discussions with the CTO or other USAID personnel (technical officers) as necessary. Q15.    SOW, page 2, I.  BACKGROUND Third paragraph. "...USAID also procures a limited amount of commercial services...".  Are commercial services contracts part of the assessment? Yes.  Q16.    SOW, page 2, I.  BACKGROUND.  Fourth paragraph.  "...exploring PBSC implications for use in issuing grants may also merit review."  Is applying PBSC methodology to grants a part of the assessment?   Yes.  Currently, the USAID Sourcebook mentioned above (located at http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/sourcebook/usgov/define.html) already discusses award of results-oriented assistance instruments (grants or cooperative agreements).  The statement in the SOW asks that the contractor identify those procedures in the PBSC arena that could be practicably used for assistance awards.  This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive review, and is not the focus of this contract. Q17.    Proposal Preparation.  1.  Technical Proposal, page 2 of 6, Note at the top of the page.  "Resumes, past performance and all other evaluated information is to be included in the fifteen (15) page limit."  Directions for 2.  Corporate/Personnel Experience section, specifically Item 2.c. calls for "Illustrated PWS with corresponding QASP developed by the offerors" submitted as part of the proposal.  Can the PWS and QASP be included as an attachment to the proposal to preclude offerors exceed the 15 page limit for the Technical Proposal? The Proposal Preparation instructions are revised as follows:  "One original and three copies of the technical proposal must be submitted and must not exceed 15 pages in length, excluding copies of relevant resumes and illustrative sample requested under Item #2 below.  The technical proposals must not contain any pricing data."   This revised language will be incorporated into the Proposal Preparation, Paragraph 1. Technical Proposal, Page 2 of 6 of the RFQ package. Q18.    Proposal Preparation.  1.  Technical Proposal, page 2 of 6, Item 3.  Management Plan, sub-item, turnover plan.  What are the turnover objectives/expectations desired within the context of the two (2) tasks?  For the Assessment (CLIN 0001) is the point of turnover the on-site presentation of the Final Assessment Report to the CTO and agency management staff?  And for the Three (3) Pilots, is the point of turnover the briefing thirty (30) days after each Pilot award?  What are the desired outcomes for each task that constitutes adequate turnover of the contractor's tasking to USAID? The turnover plan refers to how the contractor will retain/replace employees.  The requirement for addressing a turnover plan is deleted.  See the solicitation amendment. Q19.    Proposal Preparation. 3.  Assumptions, Conditions, or Exceptions, page 3 of 6, line 1.  "Offerors must submit, under separate cover, all (if any) assumptions, conditions or exceptions..."  Can assumptions, conditions or exception (if any) be addressed separately but attached to the Cost Proposal The Assumptions, Conditions, or Exceptions should be separate from both the Technical and Cost Proposal.  Q20. The RFP requires a sample Performance Work Statement, including a QASP. We assume this also includes a Performance Evaluation/Incentive Plan. Given this requirement, and the other requirements for proposal submission, the 15-page limitation seems overly restrictive. The sample PWS and QASP could approach or even exceed 15 pages in itself. We would therefore request that the 15-page limitation not include the sample PWS.  Please see the response to Question #17 above. Q21.  Is the LOE for the "Assessment" (CLIN 0001) included in the 246 LOE indicated for the "Consultation"?  No. Q22. Does the 246 hours apply only to CLIN 0002? If so, what is the LOE for CLIN 0001, or are we to propose an effort and FP for that task? CLIIN 1 is fixed price. Please note that the "assessment" called for in CLIN 001 could involve a wide range of effort depending on the number and type of contract instruments and services USAID wants considered- which are unknown. Yes, the 246 hours apply only to CLIN 0002.  Offerors must propose a fixed price for CLIN 0001.  Please see the response to Question #14. Q23.  In your contract specifications, it is stated, Place of Performance U.S. Agency for International Development 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC 20523.  Does this mean that in order to fulfill the contract, I must be in Wash DC on Pennsylvania Avenue?  Can it mean that I do the work from my office in another state, and communicate by phone, fax and e-mail as needed?  For purposes of the cost proposal, should I budget for any trips to Wash DC, to meet with the contract manager before beginning the contract, or for any other reason?   Please see the responses for Questions #6 and #11. The Offeror's cost proposal should reflect those costs necessary to perform the contract in accordance with their proposed technical approach as submitted.  As a minimum, the contractor must present the Assessment Report to USAID Management in person. Q24. Will the successful offeror be working on site at USAID or is the expectation for the successful offeror to be working from their own facility?  If a combination of on-site and off-site is expected, what is the ratio between the two? The successful offeror will not work on-site at USAID; they will attend meetings on-site with the Pillar Bureau Teams in Washington, D.C. as necessary and in accordance with their proposed technical approach. Please note the SOW requirement to provide an on-site presentation of the final assessment report. Q25.	If the work in on-site, where will the successful offeror report for work?  Will a desk, phone, and computer be provided?   See response for Question #24 and 36. Q26.  An estimated level of effort of 82 hours per pilot is provided in the instructions, but there apparently is no estimate of effort for the assessment (FFP) portion.  The period of performance is stated in the Contract Specific Information as being from Oct 2003 to Oct 2004.  Is it reasonable to assume that the desired effort is for a full year for the FFP assessment and an additional 82 hours per pilot for the T&M portion?   No. In accordance with the Technical Proposal requirements of the RFQ, the offeror must submit a plan with significant milestones and dates to accomplish the objectives of the SOW.   As outlined in Section III. DELIVERABLES, the draft assessment report for CLIN 0001 will be due 90 days after the date of this contract award.  It is anticipated that the CTO will provide comments on the report within 2 weeks.  The Final report is due within one week of receiving those comments, and the Formal Presentation to AID Management 2 weeks after that submission.  For CLIN 0002, the LOE will be utilized for the pilot activities which will end with the contract award of each pilot requirement (no later than September 30, 2004), with a Post-Award Conference (if one is scheduled) to occur no later than October 31, 2004.  A total ceiling of 246 hours for pilot consulting services is provided under CLIN 002, on a Time and Materials basis.  The 82 estimated hours per pilot is not a ceiling per pilot. Q27.  Is the cost proposal to be included in the 15 page limitation, or is the cost proposal in addition to the 15 page limitation?        The cost proposal is not included in the 15 page limitation.  The limitation applies to the technical proposal only.  The cost proposal length is unlimited. Q28. SOW II.B prescribes the required data for the Phase 1 Assessment and Recommendations Report.  Since this is a FFP CLIN, will the Government please establish boundaries by quantifying two of the required elements by placing time durations on the first and sixth bullets, as recommended below? -A summary of the types of contracts and services procured by USAID for the past  three years. -Information and lessons learned relating to successful use of PBSC by other agencies procuring similarly challenging technical support services over the past three years. The proposed time limit of 3 years is acceptable. The SOW has been changed to reflect that. Q29.  Proposal Preparation Instruction 1.2.c requires bidders to submit an illustrative sample PWS relevant to the SOW and a QSAP.  USAID has provided potential bidders with a SOW, and the PWS will essentially be a restatement of the information in the SOW.  Due to the page limitations, will the Government please eliminate the requirement for a PWS and accept the QSAP only, or allow additional pages for the PWS? The page limitations have been clarified. Please see the response to Question #17 above.  The illustrative sample PWS and QSAP should not be a restatement of the information in the SOW, it must be a sample developed by the offeror within the last thee years for professional services similar to those USAID typically procures and as described in the SOW.  Please see SOW Proposal Preparation, Section 1. Technical Proposal. Q30.  Does the title page, transmittal letter, table of contents, and section tab dividers count in the 15 page limitation? No. Question 31.  Proposal Preparation Instructions 2.a requires bidders to submit three copies of the Cost Proposal.  How many copies of the Technical Proposal are required? One original and three hard copies. The Proposal Preparation Instructions will be modified to reflect that. Q 32.  Does the Government envision the contractor performing CLIN's 0001 and 0002 in parallel or in series? Please see the response to Question #26 above. As stated in the technical proposal requirements, the offeror will propose the accomplishment of significant milestones and dates.  As indicated in the SOW, CLIN 0002 target dates for solicitation issuance and contract award must be met, April 2004 and September 2004, respectively.  Q33.  Proposal Preparation Instructions 2.c identifies the Level of Effort (LOE) as 82 hours per pilot for a total of 246 hours spread over a 1-year period.  SOW II.C subdivides the LOE into two subtasks consisting of the following for each of the three pilots: Requirements. Providing informal training, recommendations, document reviews, guidance and support necessary to each team generating the documents required through all phases of the procurement through contract award: development of the PWS, solicitation, evaluation of offers, and award; plus providing assistance as required in presenting the PBSC methodology during the Pre-Proposal and Post-Award conferences.  Based on our experience, the LOE of 82 hours per pilot appears sufficient for the Requirements subtask, but falls short of our estimates for the second subtask.   Is the 246 hour LOE provided as a sample representative for cost evaluation purposes only? Offerors should use the proposed LOE of 246 hours for cost evaluation purposes; however, if it is the opinion of the Offeror that additional hours are necessary to successfully perform the activities described herein for CLIN 0002, the offeror should separately outline those additional hours as they would be utilized by task, as well as the rationale for the additional hours. Q34.  Will the Government either add more pages for resumes, or limit the resume submission to the Task Lead or Principal Consultant?  Proposal Preparation Instruction 1.2.b requires bidders to submit resumes for the consultant/team proposed.  This requirement, along with the 15 page limitation and all of the other information required appears to indicate that the Government envisions a single person performing all of the work.  However, some of the work identified requires a senior person, while other work can be done by less expensive labor categories which may reduce the price to the Government. Please see the response to Question #17 above. Q36. The Proposal Preparation document identifies the place of performance as on-site at USAID in Washington, DC.  Please provide the answer to the following two questions. Can the work be split between the USAID/Government site and contractor site? What facilities and GFE will be provided to the contractor at the USAID/Government site.   See above response for Question #6.  No facilities or GFE will be provided to the contractor at the USAID site.

At transaction closing (signing of the ground lease), the Government will convey 1,702 units to the Successful Offeror (SO).  The SO is required to replace 1,088 units within seven years and replace an additional 400 units by the end of the 15th year.  Three units are currently adequate and will need to be replaced at the end of their useful life.  Two hundred and eleven units will be demolished in the first 15 years and will not be replaced.   

The SAFB Project will employ a two-step RFP, "Best Value" approach in accordance with the solicitation.  The Step One qualifications submittal requirements are as identified in the RFP and shall include Business, Financial, Project Concept, and Past Performance information.  The Government will reserve the right to down-select in Step One, to no more than five highly qualified or qualified Offerors to proceed to Step Two.

The AMC Protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. Send protests (other than protests to the Contracting Officer) to: He adquarters, Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, ATTN: AMCCC-PL, 5001 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001, Facsimile number (703) 617-4999/5680, Voice Number (703) 617-8176, The AMC-level protest procedures are found at:  http:(insert 2 forward slashes)www.amc.army.mil/amc/command_counsel/protest/protest.html (The double forward slashes constitute a print processing command, hence cannot be shown above. Please insert when accessing the website.)  If Internet access is not available, contact the Contracting Officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Proc edures.

Available technology will be obtained that will allow members of a large coordination center to effectively and efficiently exchange a myriad of voice and data information.  AUTOMATED DECISION AIDS:  Innovative approaches and concepts are sought to supplement and complement existing and future information systems. These aids should allow for the automation of the interagency process for target recognition and intent determination to assist decision makers and operators in determining the best course of action.  The concepts should demonstrate both software and hardware solutions capable of integrating with existing interagency legacy systems and flexible to expand with new technology.  INTELLIGENCE: Innovative approaches and concepts are sought to improve interagency information collection, analysis and dissemination.  Information management system concepts should include facilitating the flow and accessibility of information between existing systems, decision makers and operators at all levels of decisions and actions.

<RESPDATE>103103
<CONTACT>John Miller at 850-235-5399, or Contracting Officer Carol Dreger at 850-234-4863.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida  is seeking information on Propeller Shroud Systems for the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy hovercraft.  This search is not restricted to current approaches or systems used in the maritime environment.  It does include any resilient corrosion resistant Propeller Shroud technology, potentially suited for the above application used in diverse maritime as well as land environments. NSWC Panama City, is interested in materials, systems and technologies that can mitigate the physical and environmental effects that degrade Propeller Shrouds during LCAC operations. The desired system or materials will be capable of having increased corrosion resistance over current systems to levels that will increase mean time between replacement, reduce maintenance evolutions, thereby, increasing combat  readiness and reducing life cycle maintenance costs and number of parts.  The weight of the systems should be kept to a minimum.   This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent  (ISEA) research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2004-2005.  Systems could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation for future LCAC ISEA installation.  Both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches will be considered.   Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the Propeller Shroud System for use on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC) System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror.   Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.  Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  Information is to be received by the Government by COB 31 Oct 2003.  The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to reduce the cost of LCAC ISEA efforts.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the LCAC Maintenance problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is:  NAVSURFWARCEN, Panama City, Code XPM1, ATTN: J. Miller, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL  32407-7001. Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Nam Trinh at (850) 234-4546 (email trinhnk@ncsc.navy.mil).

<DESC>This is a request for information (Sources Sought Synopsis). This is not a solicitation. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing the Agency with a revised and updated version of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT) and its companion publication, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO), published by the Department of Labor (DOL). SSA relies on these publications for its disability evaluation process and work opportunity and employment support initiatives.  In its regulations, SSA takes administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications [20 CFR 404.1566(d) and 416.966(d)]. SSA currently uses the DOT and the SCO as the primary sources of information about jobs, job requirements, and the existence of work in the national economy.  In addition, SSA's regulatory guidelines are based on DOT constructs and definitions. For example, they define sedentary, light and medium strength work in the same way it is defined in the DOT/SCO. However, DOL has not formally updated the DOT/SCO since 1991 and has no plans to do so. Instead, DOL is developing an entirely new system, the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. This system is useful for career and educational exploration and planning, but it does not provide the type of data required for disability claim adjudication or vocational rehabilitation and job placement of persons with disabilities. Therefore, SSA is seeking an existing occupational database that has been updated to provide the same type of data shown in the DOT/SCO, which SSA can use while developing alternative sources of occupational data. The database must:  1) currently exist (SSA is not interested in developing such a database for interim use); 2) utilize the same constructs and definitions as the DOT/SCO; 3) contain the complete set of descriptors found in the DOT/SCO; 4) contain information on work found in the national economy that is more recent than the 1991 version of the DOT/SCO; 5) be representative of work found in the national economy; and 6) have been developed in a statistically valid, reliable and defensible manner. If you feel your organization has the corporate capability and expertise for performing this type of service, provide the following information via E-MAIL ONLY about your company: 1) company or university name, address, e-mail address, website address, point of contact, and telephone number, 2) corporate capability statement (not to exceed 2 pages) that includes similar experience and references, 3) name of the database, and 4) the source of data. This request for information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information is based on this request or information is purely voluntary. SSA may make a solicitation available at FEDBIZOPPS at a later date. If a solicitation is posted, it will be preceded by a presolicitation announcement that will specify an anticipated solicitation issue date sometime in 2003. Any questions should be submitted via E-MAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer at London.Johnson@ssa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes on commercially available software database applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently several components of the United States Air Force use a data system built with Microsoft Windows Visual Basic, Microsoft Access and Crystal Reports.  In deployed operations, databases residing on the host server can be replicated to a mobile device and updated offline.  These same databases are updated on the host server in parallel.  This parallel update could cause a conflict problem if the offline device attempts to update the databases on the host server.  Currently, the Visual Basic and Access suite cannot perform a sophisticated case-by-case basis update of individual data cells using two versions of the same database -- it can only query the user to use 1) the database version hosted on the server, or 2) the one being offered by the offline device.  The AEFB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is to solve this problem.

The AEFB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the capabilities needed for the above problem.
4.	The availability of any classroom training that could be purchased to obtain proficiency on the product, and its price or price range.
5.	Your interest to demonstrate your product using dummy data the AEFB provides (if this is requested by the government, the contractor will be required to sign a Vendor Demonstration Agreement).

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 7 Nov 03 to Major Michael Schlacter, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Early submittals would be appreciated.  Major Schlacter can be reached at (208) 828-3541.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any soicitation release. The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for Federal Stock Class 1680, which encompasses a variety of miscellaneous Aircraft accessories.

A Joint Accessories Commodity Council has been formed, and will be pursuing the development of an AFMC enterprise sourcing strategy, which could result in contractual documents for new purchases and repairs for FSC 1680 items managed by the USAF and DLA. The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve readiness, increase responsiveness of the supply chain and reduce costs. Industry input into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above objectives.

The Industry Day format will include a Government presentation on Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM), a general question and answer session, and a joint wrap up session. Suppliers are requested to identify improvements allowing the Government to meet the stated objectives. Potential improvement areas might include commercially available supply chain services, types of contracts and incentives, co-forecasting, on demand supply, etc.

<DESC>NA The Research and Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs) and the Space and Missile Defense Technology Center (SMDTC) are jointly seeking Request for Information (RFI) for Maneuver Air Defense System Concepts and Technologies for the Enhanced Area Air D efense System. The results of this RFI will be used to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agencyÃ¢Â€Â™s requirement exist. The following information further defines the anticipated need and sets forth precise response instructions:  On 12 May 2 000, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) signed Memorandum 092-00 that validated Enhanced Area Air Defense System (EAADS) as within the scope of the Theater Air and Missile Defense Mission Needs Statement and recommended initiation of Milestone  0 (now MS A) concept exploration for EAADS as a Major Defense Acquisition Program with Joint Interest.  The Vice Chief of Staff Army Memorandum, AROCM 02-014 dated 18 October 2002, resulted in the Army Training and Doctrine Command directing the U.S. Army  Air Defense Artillery School (USAADAS) to develop the EAADS Operational Requirements.  Additionally, the Unit of Action (UA) Operational and Organizational Plan and the JROC approved Future Combat Systems (FCS) Operational Requirements Document has codifi ed EAADS as the Objective Force Maneuver Air Defense Capability.  To meet these needs, an EAADS Integrated Concept Team has been formed by the USAADAS Air and Missile Defense Battle Lab (AMDBL) to develop the operational concepts and requirements for a cap ability to attack aerial threats through end-to-end engagements providing enhanced air defense for the Future Force UA and other critical assets of the maneuver force in the 2015 + 5 timeframe. The Army Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs) and the Space and Missile Defense Technology Center (SMDTC) are conducting a joint study that addresses the EAADS need and identifies and evaluates system concepts and critical technologies and will form the basis for a Science and Technology (S&T) program called Maneuver Air Defense System (MADS).  The MADS Program will demonstrate technologies and system concepts for transition to System Development and Demonstration (SDD) in the 2010 timeframe .  This study is assessing threat characteristics and operational scenarios, operational requirements and system performance parameters, and will establish a preliminary notional system breakdown of:  (1) Sensors performing functions such as surveillance, counter-fire, electronic warfare, and fire control;  (2) BMC4I performing functions such as Battle Management, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (BMC4I); and (3) Shooters consisting of weapons such as projectiles, missiles and di rected energy.  This Sources Sought / Request for Information (RFI) is designed to collect ideas on system issues and critical technology issues for further development to support the MADS study and the MADS S&T Program. THE ENHANCED AREA AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: EAADS is the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Future Force Maneuver Air Defense (AD) system.  The EAADS is an element of the Unit of Employment (UE) and will directly augment the UA organic assets to accomplish air and missile defense tasks beyond the capability of the UAÃ¢Â€Â ™s organic assets in order to protect the force and high value assets, allow the commander freedom of maneuver, and deny the enemy the ability to see first.  The EAADS is a system of systems that will consist of Shooters, Sensors and BMC4I systems that wil l be task organized and employed as Battle Elements to provide the necessary protection against threat saturation attacks, denying threat attack options and minimizing the impact of the attacks by rockets, artillery, and mortars (RAM); unmanned aerial vehi cles (UAVs); cruise missiles (CMs); rotary wing (RW) and limited fixed wing (FW) aircraft; short ranged tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs), and tactical surface to air missiles (SAM) and their launch ers.  The EAADS Shooter systems will have an Ã¢Â€Âœouter tierÃ¢Â€Â capability out to approximately 40Km to engage CMs, UAVs, and other aerial targets and an Ã¢Â€Âœinner tierÃ¢Â€Â capability that will conduct preferential active defense engagements agains t incoming RAM projectiles out to approximately 10Km, and conduct engagements of in-flight SAMs fired at approaching/departing intra-theater lift.  This is particularly critical during vertical maneuver when defeating anti-access threats.  In addition to t he Air and Missile Defense (AMD) capability, these platforms will have a direct fire capability for self-defense or a multi-functional role.  The EAADS will also have a Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) capability.  EAADS and Special Operations Fo rces (SOF) special weapons crews will be capable of employing next generation MANPADS when Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops - Time available, Civil (METT-TC) requires short range, dismounted air defense missions such as ambushing enemy RW arriving in landin g zones, conducting roof top shots in military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) environments, or performing SOF MANPADS requirements.  The EAADS Sensors (surveillance and fire control) systems will have the capability required for enabling EAADS Shooters  to conduct line-of-sight (LOS), beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS), and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) end-to-end engagements of the entire EAADS threat set.  The EAADS Sensors and BMC4I (force and engagement operations (FO/EO)) will have the capability to detect, tra ck, identify, decide, direct, and assess engagements with or without a mature Joint Tactical Air Missile Defense command and control structure.  EAADS units will also be capable of integrating with the Joint Integrated Air Defense System and provide fire d irection and control for AMD fires.  EAADS task organized battle elements will consist of a mix of Shooter, Sensors and BMC4I that will provide the following operational capabilities. Shooters: Engagements will be conducted preferentially providing the capability to engage the right threats at the optimum times and locations to maximize probability of kill and handle the saturation attack, counter the highest priority threat first, minimize colla teral damage from debris or fallout, and minimize cost and logistics.  This capability is afforded through a multi-tiered defense design consisting of inner tier and outer tier components. The initial outer tier missile interceptor component Surface Launch  Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) Block I will perform LOS, BLOS, and NLOS engagements of UAVs, CMs, RW, and limited FW threats.  The inner tier component performs preferential engagements of RAM and UAV threats through the best combinat ion of projectiles, missiles, and/or directed energy (high energy lasers/high power microwaves) solutions.  These solutions must provide a means of destroying the aerial threats within the defined battle space. Sensors: The EAADS sensors (surveillance and fire control) will have the capability required for enabling EAADS shooters to conduct LOS, BLOS, and NLOS end-to-end engagements of the entire EAADS threat set.  EAADS ground based surveillance and fire control (FC) sen sors will be capable of performing multiple-missions with multi-functional capabilities.  These sensors will be a source of local air picture information and this information will assist in the development of the 3rd dimension of the Common Operational Pic ture (COP).  The sensor information will be used for force warning, airspace management, contribute to situational awareness, provide FC quality data for inner and outer tiered interceptors, and support counter fire missions through target identification, location and track cueing and will interface with the EAADS BMC4I system. BMC4I: The EAADS BMC4I is a multi-echeloned network that will produce, distribute, and manage the required information to support multiple simultaneous engagements against a saturation attack, sensor-to-shooter linkages, weapons selection and target pairing, and integration with external sensors and data networks.  The EAADS BMC4I must provide force operations planning, coordination, directing, and controlling of EAADS Battl e Elements.  The EAADS BMC4I must also provide timely assessment of the AMD threat, the ability to conduct aerial intelligence preparation of the battlefield, rapid dissemination of tactical warning, and post-strike assessment to subordinate EAADS battle e lements.  For each EAADS battle element, a BMC4I node must provide the capability for planning FO and directing/controlling EO.  All battle element nodes require embedded training capabilities.  In developing concepts for the EAADS BMC4I system, the follow ing capabilities should be considered:  Battery/Platoon FO and EO nodes, architecture, BM planning models and simulations, engagement planning models and simulations, interoperability, communications.  The EAADS BMC4I will integrate with the Joint Integrat ed Air Defense System (JIADS), interface with the Future Force common command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, integrate/operate within the common Air and Missile Defense command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) architecture, integrate with external surveillance and warning systems, intelligence assets, decision making facilities, and higher echelon Air Defense control elements.  The EAADS battle element BMC4I syste m could be task organized into an AMD Task Force where it will be required to perform all the EAADS functions and fight a Medium Air Defense capability as well. Operational Context: Based on operational scenarios to guide the MADS Program, several defense reference missions (DRMs) have been tentatively defined which may be used to understand the MADS Program system and critical technology issues.  DRM1 is summarized below and details will be provided during the subsequent phase of the MADS program.  Future DRMs will address a much smaller conflict (DRM2-Peacekeeping) and a much larger conflict (DRM3-Major Theater of War). DRM1 takes place enroute to a land-locked objective approximately 100Km from a secured forward base of operations.  The Future Force was required to march over a narrow channel of terrain bordered by restrictive terrain that affords enemy forces considerab le concealment and protection.  The Future Forces use bounding over-watch tactics to position themselves at intermediate objectives.  The threat consisted of small caliber rockets (SCR) (i.e. 122mm) with 40 rockets per launcher and a range capability of 8K m to 45Km, large caliber rockets (LCR) (i.e. 240mm) with 12 rockets per launcher and a range of 50Km to 100Km, cannon artillery (i.e. 152mm) with a range capability of 11Km to 50Km, mortars (i.e. 82mm to 120mm) with a range from 400m to 10Km, 8 CMs, UAVs f or reconnaissance and attack capabilities. These threat systems are assigned improved capabilities commensurate with the timeframe.  Other air threats to the operation are eliminated either by the EAADS outer tier or organic assets of the UA or UE. Typical situations the EAADS Battle element will be able to handle are on the order of 200 RAM and 10 UAVs within approximately 1 minute.  Assets protected ranged from small (50m radius) items such as surveillance radars, to medium (200m by 200m) assets su ch as bridges, to large (1Km by 2Km) assets such as tactical operations centers.  It should be noted that for Peacekeeping types of situations, we expect that defense will be required against 10 or fewer SCR and mortars attacking within 10 or less seconds.   For a Large Theater of War situation, defense is likely to be required against a threat consisting of more than 200 SCRs, 100 CMs, 100 artillery/mortar systems, 10 UAVs, and fewer than 100 LCRs attacking within a battle period of 500 seconds.  It should be understood that these DRMs are only an example and the levels of any attack will vary depending on the specific situation.  Additional detail required for the respondent's idea may be obtained from appropriate open sources such as Jane's Ammunition Handbook. Further pertinent information and response instructions will follow in a modification to this RFI, W31P4Q-04-R-R003, which should be posted directly following the RFI.

<SUBJECT>A -- Fiber Laser Based Synthetic Guide Star System
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS 
COOPERATIVE R&D PARTNERS/LICENSEES TO PRODUCE A FIBER LASER BASED SYNTHETIC GUIDE STAR SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license the technology to build a fiber laser based synthetic Guide Star system.  LLNL also seeks to engage in a cooperative research program with the Licensee to assist in the commercialization of the fiber laser based synthetic Guide Star system through projects at observatories.

LLNL has developed technology for building a fiber laser based synthetic Guide Star system.  A Laser Guide Star is a man-made, star-like light source that permits an optical system (telescope) to be adjusted to cancel out the adverse effects of viewing through an atmosphere.  By detecting backscattered light from a laser beam fired into the atmosphere, computers and adaptive optics can compensate for the distorting effects of the atmosphere on astronomical images.  The Guide Star Laser creates a synthetic star by using a yellow laser  (589 nm) to excite sodium atoms, which are present in the mesosphere 90-100 km above the earth’s surface.  The successful generation of a synthetic Laser Guide Star requires precise control of the laser frequency and bandwidth to maximize the return signal from the sodium atoms.

LLNL’s present fiber laser system uses two fiber lasers operating at 938 nm and 1583 nm.  The laser system uses very stable fiber oscillators followed by high average power double clad fiber amplifiers to generate the frequency-stable continuous wave output powers required for the sum-frequency-mixing process.  The output from the two fiber lasers is mixed in a non-linear crystal to generate an output at 589 nm.  The resulting systems are simple, robust, efficient and reliable, which makes them ideal for use in remote astronomical laboratories.

LLNL has developed the technology associated with the 938 nm amplifier.  The novel 938 nm optical fiber amplifier has the following features:
·	Scalable design capable of high power outputs;
·	Operates at room temperature;
·	Can amplify a narrow bandwidth without non-linear parasitic
interference;
·	Suppresses or eliminates parasitic amplified spontaneous emission at
1088 nm; 
·	Makes efficient use of pump power; and
·	Can be operated in continuous wave or pulsed temporal format.

LLNL’s fiber laser systems offer advantages over competing solid state laser designs.  Bulk solid state lasers require careful optical design to manage the thermal and beam aberrations expected in this type of laser, and such systems will probably require the maintenance services of a laser expert. Fiber lasers are self contained, turnkey units that require minimal maintenance from a non-laser expert.

LLNL is aware of several upcoming competitions for contracts to build synthetic Guide Star laser systems at different observatories around the world.  The observatories will give preference to a provider who partners with a commercial vendor to provide additional future systems and long term maintenance assistance..  LLNL would like to work with a partner under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop this technology, and to license its technology to build additional fiber-based Laser Guide Star systems in the future.  LLNL plans to bid directly for the first contract.  After the award of the contract, LLNL and the industrial partner would execute a CRADA.  Under the CRADA, LLNL would develop the first system for delivery and transfer the technology for building the Guide Star laser system to the industrial partner.  The industrial partner would build and maintain the future laser systems with the support of LLNL.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Guide Star Laser system should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000057-03


Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Guide Star laser system.
