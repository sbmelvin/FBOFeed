That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined officail applications in use, adn since the design is already active domestically a new complet risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design.  Specific components within the infrasturcutre were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requireemnts, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems adn overall performance.  As this is a brand name only justifications, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as teh basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requiremnts as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A Ploidy Analyzer is required to determine the number of Chromosomes in plant species or after genetic crosses by measuring the DNA content of nuclei.  By providing a rapid and accurate method for determining chromosome number, the instrument supplants the very time consuming, labor intensive and imprecise procedure of chromosome counting.  Unlike chromosome counting, the Ploidy Analyzer can determine chromosome number in vegetative as well as reproductive tissue.  A suitable instrument will have a resolution of +/-1 chromosome to detect anueploids and to improve resolution for species like guayule that contain UV fluorescent compounds in their leaves.  For ease of use, the instrument should be self-contained and dedicated for DNA analysis of nuclei.

To our knowledge, Partec GmbH, Munster, Germany manufactures the only Ploidy Analyzers on the market.  These instruments are distributed by GCAT, Gene Check Applied Technologies, Ft. Collins, CO.  A suitable model that meets our requirements for sensitivity and ease of operation is the Partec PA.  

A solicitation is not available for this requirement but interested firms can submit proposals to the attention of Regan Alexander as listed above.  See numbered notes 22.

<DESC>1.	The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a Brand Name Only, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), to Metro Medical Equipment and Supply Inc., 7550 N. Broadway, St. Louis, MO 63147. The BPA is for Smith and Nephew brand surgical supplies, surgical instruments and patient implantable items. The items are for use with a Smith and Nephew video tower and Information Management System (IMS). Smith and Nephew is the manufacturer of the products and Metro Medical Equipment and Supply Inc. is the only known source and distributor for the Smith and Nephew products. Use of other than Smith and Nephew brand products with the Smith and Nephew video tower and IMS creates a safety and equipment risk because use has the potential of causing damage to the Smith and Nephew surgical equipment creating an unacceptable risk for patients. Additionally, the surgical staff requires that a Smith and Nephew technical representative be on call 24 hours/7 days a week in order to provide the necessary consultation to operating room personnel. The period of performance for this BPA is five years.

2.	The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 100 employees.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Tara Petersen 8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103 USAFA, CO 80840 Telephone number 719-333-2074 FAX 719-333-9018 email: tara.petersen@usafa.af.mil Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Sigcom Inc, 4230 Beechwood Drive, Greensboro NC 27410-8107. AFRL/IFOS is requesting an upgrade to their current Video Teleconferencing (VTC) system, from three displays of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) to two Plasma displays, and a replacement for the red and black Secure/Non-Secure Hadax switches with a SIGCOM MultiClass3TM Controllable IP Secure VTC Enhancement.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334119.

Sole Source Justification:

Sigcom Inc. is the only source that manufactures and has NSA certification to install, integrate, program, and test Type I encryption devices and connect them to the DVS-G proprietary network that the VTC systems will utilize. Sigcom owns the source code that will allow the successful reprogramming of the control units required to integrate these additional VTC components into the existing NETCOM VTC enterprise. Sigcom Inc. has no authorized resellers or partners; therefore only one source exists. Sigcom, Inc. is the only company that can meet the technical specifications and capabilities required by AFRL/IFOS.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  Award will not be limited to Small Business concerns.
A Presidential Initiative to increase health care access in the Nation's most needy communities began in Fiscal Year 2002.  This effort featured the creation of Federally-Qualified Health Center New Access Points and the expansion of capacity at existing Health Center access points.  Early in this initiative, HRSA requested that an evaluation study be carried out to ensure that the needs determination methodology in use by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) as part of the Health Center New Starts and Expansion grant application process was effectively targeting new grant funding to the neediest areas.  The resulting study determined that methods then in place for scoring and comparing the relative needs of different community service areas and population groups could be substantially improved.  As a result, the process used by BPHC for determining the Need For Assistance (NFA) of applicant communities was revised, to (1) reduce the total number of need indicators considered; (2) more carefully define these indicators and the scoring scales or benchmarks to be used with them; and (3) require the use of clearly verifiable data sources in submission of supporting data.   

The Purposes of this Contract are: (1) to update the Access Barrier Scales and Disparities Benchmarks used, within the Need for Assistance (NFA) methodology, for assessing the comparative needs of different communities applying for Health Center New Access Point grants; (2) to update the NFA Data Resource Guide, which is available to Health Center grant applicants through the HRSA-BPHC website, for applicant use in (a) locating available data relevant to the various NFA benchmarks and (b) identifying those data that are specific to their service area and/or population and (c) using these data to fill in the NFA Worksheet which is required as part of New Access Point applications; and (3) to carry out any impact or other analyses needed to make decisions about alternative choices for scales, benchmarks or Data Resource Guide references.

The contractor shall: 1) Update Barrier Scales and Disparities Benchmarks within the NFA Methodology; 2) Update NFA Data Resource Guide: 3) Conduct Relevant Analyses; and 4) Submit Progress Reports and a Final Report.

THE SOLICITATION is attached to this web posting.
	
ALL QUESTIONS about this requirement must be submitted by email to abroider@hrsa.gov no later than 10:00 AM local prevailing time on August 28, 2007.  Responses to questions will be posted at this site.

THE CLOSING DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS will be on September 7, 2007, at no later than 10:00 AM local prevailing time.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has been tasked to instrument and test the LCAC model.  One aspect of the program is to measure and record specific parameters associated with the interests of the program.  These parameters are provided via installed transducers of various types with various data output formats.  In order to meet this requirement, NSWCCD needs to expand the capabilities of a currently owned HBM data collection system that will be used to conduct this test.  The components required to allow the expansion of capabilities must conform to the same requirements as the components used in the present system.  The requested components will have virtually identical fit and function to those of the present system.  Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with HBM, Inc where the items are constrained by the technical requirements of the LCAC test objectives, the test environmen!  t, timeliness of delivery and especially compatibility with the existing system.  The requested components meet all form, fit and function criteria required for this application and have been proven to be reliable in previous similar applications.  All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to ADI Limited, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Division, Cowper Wharf Road, Garden Island, Australia, on a sole-source basis for the acquisition of one (1) Sweep Tracker Monitor System (STMS4) to interface with the Advanced Acoustic Generator (AAG) and the Infrasonic AAG (IAAG).  The AAG is a water driven turbine powered acoustic generators that produces ship emulation and can be integrated with any sweep system.  The IAAG is the low frequency variant of the Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG).    This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The STMS4 is designed for deployment with the AAG and IAAG to provide positional tracking data and to facilitate control of both manned and unmanned operations.  The STMS4 is unique equipment that is only manufactured by ADI Limited.  The STMS was manufactured exclusively to interface with the AAG and IAAG.   There are no distr!  ibutors.  The AAG and IAAG as well as the STMS4 are proprietary to ADI Limited.  NSWC PC has successfully evaluated this equipment for use in the US Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Fleet having acquired the equipment under contract N61331-06-C-0030 and N61331-07-D-0006.  Use of alternate equipment will invalidate these tests.  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to the STMS would require extensive development funds that ADI has already expended and will not be cost effective for the US Navy.  Additionally, numerous patent issues could require resolution.  In summary, the Sweep Tracker Monitor System is only available from ADI Limited.  NAICS Code:  334419.  FSC Code:  5845.   Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Perinatology Research Branch (PRB) intends to procure the services of David Todem to support the research effort of the PRB of the NICHD through design and analysis of longitudinal studies using comprehensive, state of the art statistical methods.  The contract shall provide study investigators with expert statistical advice to be used in all phases of conducting individual studies.  This is a continuation of statistical and methodological methods developed by David Todem in Perinatal Health for PRB.

Specific tasks include the following:

The Contractor shall utilize the existing databases, within the Branch, that consist of previously collected obstetric data, to facilitate investigations of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and small neonates for gestational age.

In particular, the Contractor shall consider both parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric statistical models needed to understand the relationship between pregnancy outcomes (Preeclampsia, Small neonates for gestational age, and uncomplicated pregnancies) and prenatal biologic analytes (VEGFR-1, PIGF, and s-eng Endoglin) measured over time.  Contractor shall use models that appropriately account for association in the data.  Parametric models will include both linear and nonlinear models.  Specifically, the Contractor shall use parametric growth curve models (mixed-effects models, nonlinear mixed effects models and population-averaged models) to prenatal biologic analytes viewed as responses.  To increase efficiency, the Contractor shall consider model-based standard errors after a careful modeling of the association structure in the data.  Other parametric model shall include prediction models based on polytomous logistic regression for identifying patients with the clinical disease, using either each analyte, and as well as a combination of analytes viewed as covariates.  Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) shall also be constructed and classification matrices generated.  The contractor shall use semiparametric models that use robust ?Sandwich? estimators to estimate the standard errors of the parameter estimates when the association structure in the data is misspecified.  Nonparametric models will include descriptive tools such as spline  models and explanatory tools such as regression trees and classification trees for longitudinal data.

It is common that in medical research, with the current technology, a level of some analytes may be detectable only above a threshold level.  A good example in the database available at the Branch is the PIGF analyte, which is only measured above some threshold value.  The Contractor shall then consider a piece-wise growth curve model or any other novel tool to adequately capture this feature of the data.

The Contractor shall check all model fits for individual and systematic departures of the observed and fitted values using informal (e.g. inspection of residuals) and formal methods (e.g. based on Wald, Likelihood ratio and score tests for extra parameters).  If individual outliers are detected, their influence will be evaluated by comparing models with and without outlying values.   When we are not successful in fitting the parametric model, then non-parametric methods such as generalized additive models shall be utilized.  To minimize bias in the prediction model, the Contractor shall consider a cross-validation method by splitting the original data into a training sample (about ? of data) and a testing set (about ?).

Contractor will provide the background and reasoning for using a particular method of analyzing the data.  Contractor will provide the PRB with references for the method(s) chosen.

Contractor shall utilize updated versions of software packages that he/she considers most appropriate for the type of data handled.  In addition the Contractor shall consider programming new methodologies and models using matrix oriented-software packages as these new models may not be fitted using commercial software packages.  Contractor will perform intensive computation, including bootstrapping and permutation, for statistical hypothesis testing.

The Contractor shall provide administrative support for the research projects such as typing of statistical reports and submissions for publications; literature searches and collection of scientific papers; copying of scientific papers; maintaining and updating a computerized reference library (e.g. EndNote).

Place of Performance and additional tasks
Work is to be performed by Contractor both at the PRB site at Wayne State University located in Detroit, Michigan and at Contractor?s own location.  To function effectively, the PRB will hold frequent meetings input from, and collaboration with, its Cooperative Group partners and other stakeholders.  The Contractor shall attend in-person onsite month meetings organized by the head of PRB or his designee at the PRB premises, for an overview of the conduct of the project. In addition, the Contractor shall organize and coordinate in-person weekly meetings (preferably on Fridays) on methodological and statistical issues of the project in collaboration with the PRB project director or designee.  The Contractor should be a member of a task specific panel made of all consultants that offer statistical advice and reviews about all aspects of PRB statistical operations.  Areas in which this task-specific panel would be of value include, study design, data management and analysis, and interpretation of results.  This panel will primarily meet every week in person, although the PRB may elect, in addition, to host conference call meetings to minimize costs for in-person meetings.

Deliverables
Contractor will deliver the information in an understandable format including tabular and graphic presentations of the data. Contractor will make formal presentations of the data analyses and results.  The Contractor shall also co-author, in collaboration with the PO, other staff members of PRB as appropriate, the results of these investigations at appropriate scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The Contractor will keep the PO appraised of research and anticipated publications and presentations on an ongoing basis.  All anticipated papers, abstracts, and other publications will go through the usual review procedures of PRB prior to submission.  Because of the nature of the work done in the contract, it is expected that expect under unusual circumstances, statistical and methodological publications will include one or more PRB staff as co-authors.

By Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service Cotton Quality Research Center, Clemson, South Carolina, is in need of a commercial item that is being acquired from the sole source.  The Cotton Quality Research Center conducts research (its objectives are to determine and quantify by physical measurements and chemical and biological analyses the properties of cotton fibers that explain variations in processing efficiency and end use quality and to develop and implement rapid instruments and methods for measuring these properties) under a variety of commercial/experimental conditions that are studied using modern manufacturing procedures.  To promote this research, the Research Center must use state-of-the-art equipment for very specific research.  The property that is being solicited is the USTER AFIS Pro BASE UNIT which contains the NC Module which counts nep imperfections (small knots or clusters of fiber) and the optional L&M Module which measures fiber length and short fiber content, plus cotton maturity and immature fiber content.  Basic measurements of the NC Module include the amount of cotton fiber and seed coat neps (see below for details).  The optional L&M Module measures fiber length and short fiber content, plus cotton maturity and immature fiber content (see below for details).  It is imperative that the Cotton Quality Research Station obtain an instrument for measuring the fiber quality parameters of individual cotton fibers.  The unique measuring system of the USTER AFIS PRO counts every fiber, nep and trash particle one by one.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that the AFIS PRO produces as its data product distributions of the measured fiber properties as opposed to bulk average values produced by similar items (see below).   The Fiber Individualizer ensures single fiber measurement.  This design provides data of accuracy and precision required for researchers to make sound process control decisions.  The USTER AFIS Sensor also uses patented technology, ensuring true single fiber, nep and trash particle counts so that the researchers get the detailed information needed to set production machinery accurately.  In particular, the NC (Nep Count) Module measures the following parameters:  Nep Cnt/g - The total nep count normalized per gram. This includes both fiber and seed coat neps.  Nep size - The mean size of all neps (both fiber and seed coat neps).  SCN Cnt/g - Seed coat nep count per gram.  This is the number of neps normalized per gram that are classified as seed coat neps.  SCN Size - Seed coat nep size. The mean size of the seed coat neps.  The L&M (Length & Maturity) Module measures:  L(n) - Mean length of the fibers calculated by number.  L(n) %CV - Coefficient of the variation of the mean length of the fibers calculated by number.  SFC(n) - The percent of fibers, calculated by number, that are less than the length entered for the SHORT FIBER CONTENT limit.  L(w) - The average length of all the fibers in the sample computed on a weight basis.  L(w)%CV - Coefficient of variation of the mean length of the fibers calculated by weight.  SFC(w) - The average short fiber content of all the fibers in the sample calculated on a weight basis.  UQL(w) - Upper Quartile length of the fibers by weight.  This is the length which is exceeded by 25% of the fibers by weight.  Fineness - Mean fiber fineness in weight per unit length.  Maturity Ratio - The ratio of fibers with a 0.5 (or more) circularity ratio divided by the amount of fibers with a 0.25 (or less) circularity.  IFC - Immature Fiber Content is the percentage of fibers with less than a 0.25 circularity.  There is no known vendor that makes any thing that will do what the AFIS (Advanced Fiber Information System) can do.  As explained above, the USTER AFIS PRO measures individual fibers and neps by utilizing patented and proprietary high speed electro-optic systems.   Based upon an exhaustive survey of the market we have determined that the only possible competitors to the USTER AFIS PRO are the high volume instrument systems (HVI) and the Isotester.  The HVI's and Isotester measure bulk average fiber properties associated with a bulk fiber sample as opposed to distributional information associated with the distribution of individual fiber properties.   The HVI systems measure average values of bulk fiber samples for the following parameters that are similar, but not exactly the same as those measured by the USTER AFIS PRO:  Rd - Fiber Reflectance.  +b - Fiber yellowness.  %Area - Area of trash particles visible on surface of fiber.  TrashParticleCount - Number of trash particles per unit surface area of fiber.  Staple - Effective length of the fibers measured in inches.   UHM - Upper half mean length of the fibers measured in inches.   UI - Length uniformity index.  SFC - The percent of fibers by weight less than 12.5 mm in length.  The Isotester measures the following parameters for average bulk specimens that are similar, but not exactly the same as those measured by the USTER AFIS PRO:  CG - Color Grade.  Rd - Fiber Reflectance.  +b - Fiber yellowness.  %Area - Area of trash particles visible on surface of fiber.  TrashParticleCount - Number of trash particles per unit surface area of fiber.  Staple - Effective length of the fibers measured in inches.  UHM - Upper half mean length of the fibers measured in inches.   UI - Length uniformity index.  SFC - The percent of fibers by weight less than 12.5 mm in length.   Our market research consulted several resources.  These included scientific journals, periodicals/popular press, internet search, and commodity/trade associations.  In particular:  Scientific Journals: Textile Research Journal and Journal of Cotton Science.  Periodicals/ Popular Press: Textile News and Textile World.  Internet Search: http://www.premierevolvics.com/; http://www.schaffnertech.com/; and http://www.uster.com/uster.asp?content=17&idMainNavig=2&title=FIBER; Commodity/Trade Association:  Cotton Incorporated, The National Cotton Council, and the Agricultural Marketing Service - Cotton Program.

<DESC>Expert services are required to support the National Library of Medicine's mandate to provide bibliographic control of all English language biomedical serials procured for the NLM, to announce these publications to the worldwide biomedical community and to assist biomedical libraries in the bibliographic control of their serial acquisitions by providing cataloging copy.

The National Library of Medicine has an arrearage of over 1,200 titles in the English language which the Cataloging Section is mandated to begin to eliminate during the next fiscal year.  NLM requires assistance in cataloging these serials since it does not have the necessary resources to catalog them.

In order to bring the backlog of over 1,200 uncataloged English language serials under control, NLM requires assistance in cataloging between 125-200 serial titles in these languages. NLM anticipates that (a) approximately 50-80 items will constitute new serial titles cataloged; and (b) approximately 75-120 items will be titles completed from records identified in the OCLC WorldCAT. 

The project entails: 1) searching titles in the OCLC WorldCAT, an outside bibliographic source, to identify and download any matching serial bibliographic records available into NLM?s Voyager catalog; 2) verifying/correcting bibliographic data,  including name and series access points, on existing bibliographic records in accordance with Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition, rev. 1998 (AACR2R) rules, the Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRIs), the CONSER Standard Record Guidelines (CSR), and NLM Instructions for Serials Cataloging, in the Voyager and OCLC databases; 3) adding appropriate NLM subject headings (MeSH) and classification numbers as needed to the record in Voyager and OCLC; and 4) tagging the identified OCLC records found with NLM?s special holdings symbol, adding NLM?s unique control numbers, title abbreviations, and indexing information as needed.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or cooperative research agreement.  The technology includes a "Method for Enhance Accuracy in Predicting Peptide Elution Time" (Battelle IPID No. 13717-E) and the "In-Solution Fragmentation System and Processes for Identification of Proteins and Peptides for Proteomic Analysis" (Battelle IPID No. 15260-E).  These are methods and devices for improving the accuracy of peptide/protein identification in mass spectrometry analyses.  The peptide elution time prediction technology uses an artificial neural network method to derive predicted peptide elution times that can be compared to actual peptide elution times produced by liquid chromatography to improve peptide identification confidence.  The in-solution fragmentation system is a method and device for fragmenting peptides using immobilized enzymes that is potentially a superior approach to gas-phase MS/MS for deriving product ions from precursor ions.  Note:  THIS IS NOT A  PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Thermo Fisher Scientific, One Thermo Fisher Way, Oakwood Village, OH 44146-6519 as the only responsible source that can provide components for and authorized installation of Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (DT-648 Shipping Machine to a DT-702 Shipping Machine); Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (M6600 TLD Card Reader to M6600 Plus TLD Card Reader); and QTY 1 Model 8800 Plus TLD Reader with Internal Sr-90 .5 mCi Irradiator.

This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 are incorporated.     NAICS 334519 (Size Standard - 500 Employees for purposes of reporting contact action).

The Navy Dosimetry Center requires the components for and authorized installation of Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (DT-648 Shipping Machine to a DT-702 Shipping Machine); Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (M6600 TLD Card Reader to M6600 Plus TLD Card Reader); and QTY 1 Model 8800 Plus TLD Reader with Internal Sr-90 .5 mCi Irradiator.

There is no other company?s product that is compatible with the "Saint Go Bain" dosimeters and TLD reader instruments currently in the Navy (and other Defense agencies) inventory. Saint Go Bain was bought by Thermo Electron Corp, and is now marketed exclusively by Thermo Fisher. The current medical  inventory of equipment and TLDs is substantially in excess of $4Million, which was originally procured following a best value determination, not including the combatant fleet inventory. The Navy has an installed base of this product line of equipment, replacement of the entire inventory is not a cost effective alternative, eliminating the possibility of procuring any other manufacturer's products.  

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable TLD reader instruments are the components for and authorized installation of Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (DT-648 Shipping Machine to a DT-702 Shipping Machine); Upgrade of a Radiation Monitoring system (M6600 TLD Card Reader to M6600 Plus TLD Card Reader); and QTY 1 Model 8800 Plus TLD Reader with Internal Sr-90 .5 mCi Irradiator manufactured by Thermo Fisher.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. Capability statement offered must be for complete systems to be considered. All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Richard Taylor at richard.taylor@med.navy.mil. Statements are due by 1200 (12:00 PM) Eastern Time 31 AUG 07.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-(b)(1), services regarding:  Conducting sequential HPV serology before and at diagnosis of cutaneous SCC, using serum samples from 132 cases from the Skin Cancer Prevention Study with Dartmouth Medical School, One Medical Center Drive, 7927 Rubin Building, Lebanon, NH 03756. 

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requisition is to provide service in order to investigate the natural history of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the etiology of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the Skin Cancer Prevention Trial.  Services shall be provided for one year from date of award.  The skin cancer prevention trial evaluated the risk of subsequent basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and SCC cell skin among patients with a prior history of these tumors to examine these risks in relation to the patients characteristics and life-style factors.  The study followed 1,805 individuals who were diagnosed with BCC or SCC of the skin from January 1980 and February 1986 and were free of skin cancer at study entry.  Annual skin examinations were conducted and skin biopsies were performed if patients developed skin cancers. One hundred and thirty-two individuals developed SCC during the study period.  Family studies of patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a rare inherited disorder characterized by early onset of cutaneous flat-to-papillomatous reddish-brown pigmented plaques with susceptibility to early onset NMSC, have impaired cellular immunity that makes them susceptible to widespread chronic infection with HPV 5 and 8.  Initial serologic studies also provide evidence that HPV is a potential etiologic factor in NMSC.  However, these studies were small and only investigated a limited number of HPV types.  In this requirement, the contractor shall investigate the hypothesis that HPV is involved in the etiology of cutaneous SCC.  All SCC cases and control serum specimens shall be analyzed by the contractor for antibodies to the major capsid protein L1 of HPV types 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, 38, and 57.  The serology data shall be analyzed by the contracting laboratory.  This study will assess the risk of SCC with HPV and will evaluate sequential HPV serology before and at or after diagnosis of SCC providing critical information about the natural history of HPV in the etiology of SCC.  Dartmouth Medical School shall investigate the natural history of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the etiology of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the Skin Cancer Prevention Trial.  Sequential HPV serology before and at diagnosis of cutaneous SCC will be conducted, using serum samples from 132 cases from the Skin Cancer Prevention Study.  Dartmouth Medical School owns the data, blood and serum specimens collected during the Skin Cancer Prevention Study.  NCI will also randomly select controls for each study (age and gender matched).  The contractor  shall provide the serum from all the cases and controls from the Skin Cancer Prevention Study.  NCI plans to screen serum samples of individuals with and without SCC for HPV for antibodies to a variety of HPV types.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with University Hospital of Lund, Getingevagen 4, Lund, Sakane, Sweden 222 41 to measure H. pylori, H. pullorum, H. bilis, and H. hepaticus in 680 serum samples from the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study. The Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study was conducted to investigate risk factors for biliary tract cancer. Infection of the biliary tract has been suspected to be a possible risk factor for biliary tract cancer.  Molecular studies have shown that H. species (H. hepaticus, H. bilis, and H. pullorum) DNA can be detected in gallbladder and bile duct tumor tissue, suggesting a possible role of these bacteria in the etiology of biliary carcinogenesis.  However, investigation of the Helicobacter hypothesis, especially that of the H. species, is hampered by the lack of specific assays to detect antibodies to H. species.  This is due largely to the potential cross-reactivity in assays of H. pylori and H. species and to a relatively high prevalence of H. pylori infection (>50%) in most populations.  The contractor will perform the following tasks:  1)  They shall measure H. pylori, H. pullorum, H. bilis, and H. hepaticus in 680 serum samples;  2)  H. hepaticus, H. bilis, H. pullorum, and H. pylori shall be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), using methods that have been adapted from those reported in the recent publication by Vorobjova et al (4) and developed at Dr. Wadstrom's laboratory;  and  3)  Samples should be assayed in the order provided by NCI.  University Hospital of Lund is the only vendor known to the HREB that is currently measuring all three H. species, namely H. pullorum, H. bilis, and H. hepaticus.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 5, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award a modification for one year and three option periods to Contract No. W81XWH-06-C-0414 with Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc. (HMJF), locate d at 1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 600, Rockvile, MD, 20852, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government believes that HMJF is the only  contractor with the expertise to support the Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Systems (DOD-GEIS) mission to guide our preparedness and response to an influenza pandemic with the intent of (1) stopping, slowing, or otherwise limiting the spread of a pandemic to the United States; (2) limiting the domestic spread of a pandemic, and mitigating disease, suffering and death; and (3) sustaining infrastructure and mitigating impact to the economy and functioning of society.  HMJF provides on-si te analytic and management support specific to the requirements of the DoD-GEIS and the U.S. Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA) for the management and execution of the specified DoD Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Tasks outlined in the DoD Pandemic Implementation Plan.  HMJF offers the unique capabilities to manage and provide oversight of the implementation of a program for a comprehensive DOD avian/pandemic influenza surveillance for pandemic influenza by offering the following to the Government: 1) HMJF maintains a leasing department that can procure needed space, conduct renovations, and outfit facilities to support a 24/7 operations center for avian influenza on a short term basis without encumbering the government to a long term ven ture which is consistent with the militarys leadership guidance; 2) HMJFs non-profit status serves as a cost saving measure to provide the support infrastructure to effectively manage a comprehensive worldwide surveillance program; 3) HMJF provides the a dministrative core staff for the management and oversight of the AI/PI program; 4) HMJF has established a communications center for coordinating the global surveillance and research efforts related to avian influenza/pandemic influenza (AI/PI); 5) HMJF pro vides surveillance capabilities for domestic and international monitoring, including efforts using the Global Emerging Infections System (GEIS).  Such efforts are integrated with other ongoing surveillance systems along with the integration of pandemic and  response planning in the Department of Defense with the planning of other Federal departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State, and USA ID; collaborating (as appropriate) with international entities engaged in pandemic preparedness and response.  Additionally, HMJF has demonstrated a capability for acceleration of medical research and development related to pandemic influenza.  This notice  is not a request for a competitive quote.  Parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services must furnish in writing, factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates evidence that another source is capable of meeti ng the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the modification will be awarded with out further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  dana.herndon@us.army.mil

That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-tdetermined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requiremnts for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design.  Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability fo the compatiiblity of the components within existing systems and overall performance.  The estitmated DoS cost for this purchase of these bran name hardware and associated support products is approximately $__. As this is a brand name only justifications, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for thsi justifiaiton. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.

<DESC>Amendment 01:

The purpose of Amendment No. 01 is to change the Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) Language cited in Section III: Eligibility Information, Paragraph A, Sub-Paragraph No. 1 of BAA07-59 (TBN) as follows: 

FROM:

SECTION III: ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

A.  Eligible Applicants 

1. Procurement Integrity, Standards of Conduct, Ethical Considerations, and
    Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

It has been confirmed that the DARPA Program Manager responsible for this BAA is assigned under the Interdepartmental Personnel Act (IPA) program and, as such, is likely to have a potential conflict of interest with Stanford University.  Because the Program Manager may be employed by an offeror that responds directly to this BAA, Stanford University may have a conflict of interest with a potential offeror, should they choose to respond.  

Certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees may exist, including special Government employees (18 U.S.C. 207).  If a prospective proposer believes that a conflict of interest exists, the situation should be raised to the DARPA Technical Point of Contact specified in Sec. VIII. before time and efforts are expended in preparing a proposal.  All proposers and proposed subcontractors must therefore affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering, and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organization conflicts of interest (FAR 9.5) must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken or proposed to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.

TO:
1. Procurement Integrity, Standards of Conduct, Ethical Considerations, and
    Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

Certain post-employment restrictions on former federal officers and employees may exist, including special Government employees (including, but not limited to, Title 18, Section 207, United States Code, the Procurement Integrity Act, 41 U.S.C. 423, and FAR 3.104.)  Current federal employees are prohibited from participating in particular matters involving conflicting financial, employment, and representational interests (18 USC 203, 205, and 208.) Prior to the start of proposal evaluations, the Government will assess whether any potential conflict of interest exists in regards to the DARPA Program Manager, as well as those individuals chosen to evaluate proposals received under this BAA. The Program Manager is required to review and evaluate all proposals received under this BAA and to manage all selected efforts. The Program Manager for this BAA is a detailee to DARPA under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) from Stanford University, and, as such, is highly likely to have a conflict of interest with respect to proposals utilizing that institution as a performer.  Proposers should carefully consider the composition of their performer team before submitting a proposal to this BAA.

All Proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering, and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the Proposer supports and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest (FAR 9.5) must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the Proposer has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. In accordance with FAR 9.503 and without prior approval or a waiver from the DARPA Director, a Contractor cannot simultaneously be a SETA and Performer.  Proposals that fail to fully disclose potential conflicts of interests and include an effective mitigation plan, or that do not include a mitigation plan at all, will be returned without technical evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award. 

If a prospective Proposer believes that any conflict of interest exists or may exist (whether organizational or otherwise), the Proposer should promptly raise the issue with DARPA by sending Proposer contact information and a summary of the potential conflict by email to the mailbox address for this BAA at BAA07-59@darpa.mil, before time and effort are expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan. If, in the sole opinion of the Government after full consideration of the circumstances, any conflict situation cannot be effectively mitigated, the proposal may be returned without technical evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award under this BAA.


This amendment also changes the Evaluation Criteria cited in Section V: Application Review Information, Paragraph A of BAA07-59 (TBN) as follows: 

FROM: 

SECTION V: APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION 

A. Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific/technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:


TO:
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific/technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:

This amendment further changes the Technology Transition language cited in Section V: Application Review Information, Paragraph A, and Sub-paragraph No. 5 of BAA07-59 (TBN) as follows: 

FROM:

5. Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition 
The capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense.


TO:
5. Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition 
The offeror's plans and capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense, to include the extent to which intellectual property rights limitations creates a barrier to technology transition.

NOTE: A revised BAA, reflecting the aforementioned changes, is attached to this notice.

<DESC>Questions 1 through 18 have been submitted and are responded to as follows:


1.	QUESTION:	Will the team awarded the contract be expected to provide geo-technical and survey services for the proposed facility?
	ANSWER:	The geo-technical and survey services for the site will not be a part of this contract.

2.	QUESTION:	What is the goal for minority participation, if any?
	ANSWER:	The awardee, if a large business, will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.

3.	QUESTION:	Is there a page limit?
	ANSWER:	There is no page limitation, however, the information required for evaluation is specifically set forth in the announcement and responses should be relevant, thorough, and concise. 
 
4.	QUESTION:	Is there a font size and style required?
	ANSWER:	No.	

5.	QUESTION:	Under "Description" The second sentence under paragraph two reads "The lease will be" etc.   Is the anticipated work to take place in an existing facility or is this for a new building?
	ANSWER:	The site is not yet selected.  It could be a Greenfield site or an existing building.

6.	QUESTION:	In the RFP released on August 7, 2007 for Solicitation Number H07-1150 the estimated Construction range is listed as only $10,000,000.00.  Is this correct?
	ANSWER:	In accordance with the FAR , the construction range shown in the announcement is more than $10,000,000.00.

7.	QUESTION:	I was looking for the following information:
 			1. Contract Value
			2. Acquisition Strategy (small business, full and open competition, set aside)
			3. Technical Point of Contact
	ANSWER:	1. The estimated contract value is not public information.
			2. This procurement is open to all business classifications.
			3.  Technical Point of Contact will be designated after award.

8.	QUESTION:	In the section under project team item number 8 asked us to provide the percent of time committed to this team per week, can we break the time commitment down by phase?
	ANSWER:	Yes.

9.	QUESTION:	Item 9 of the project team section asks for a synopsis of design experience including firm name(s), years with each firm and type of design experience with each firm, how far back are we supposed to go for each team member?
	ANSWER:	5 years

10.	QUESTION:	1.Will there be a pre-proposal conference?  
			2. Is there a more detailed package of submittal requirements?  
			3. Is this a multi-step RFP process? as this solicitation does not appear to require a fee break down, at this time.  
			4.  Will there be a formal interview process once you have selected a limited number of qualified firms?
	ANSWER:	1. See Modification 1.
			2. See Synopsis
			3 &4.  SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm(s) based on the published selection criteria. Past performance will be evaluated. Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms ranked as most highly qualified.  After interviews, the most highly qualified firm will be requested to submit a cost proposal for consideration.

11.	QUESTION:	Are there any page limits or font size limits for this proposal?
	ANSWER:	See numbers 3 and 4 above.

12.	QUESTION:	Specifically we are interested in whether this project opportunity is a fit-out of existing space or will it be new construction.  And is it a requirement that the team have experience in the permitting process in the Frederick area.  Meaning do we need to have a local architect in Frederick on the team?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above. The A/E will be responsible for producing a design that, at the initial submission to the governing authority, will meet all of the standard and unique code requirements of Frederick City or County.  The A/E will also be responsible for substantiating compliance to the governing authority in a timeframe which does not cause delays during the utility and construction permitting process.

13.	QUESTION:	A question was whether you anticipate extending the due date, since the time between the site meeting and the sending of the deliverable is only about 4 working days?  SF 330's are very challenging, and to incorporate the learning from the meeting in such a short time will be quite a challenge, especially with a holiday in between. 
	ANSWER:	A time extension may be considered if questions or issues arise during the pre-proposal conference which would substantially change the response requirements as set forth in the announcement on August 7, 2007.

14.	QUESTION:	The primary question we have is this. Is this project for new construction, or is it the fit-out of a leased facility? The RFP is not quite clear on this issue and it has a very material impact on how we would assemble our proposal. Any chance you could answer this question very soon?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above.

15.	QUESTION:	Does the Government intend to evaluate multiple sites?
	ANSWER:	Yes, multiple sites are being evaluated.

16.	QUESTION:	Will the facilities be housed in new construction on a "greenfield" site, or in existing buildings requiring renovation/fit-out design?
	ANSWER:	See number 5 above.

17.	QUESTION:	What is the relationship between the Government, SAIC, and/or a third party regarding: ownership of the site and building(s); and operation of the facilities?	
	ANSWER:	SAIC-Frederick, Inc. will lease and operate the facility for the National Cancer Institute.

18.	QUESTION:	What are the roles of SAIC and NIH-NCI in the evaluation of responses to the solicitation? 
 	ANSWER:	SAIC-Frederick, Inc., in its role as Operations and Technical Support Contractor for the NCI at Frederick will be responsible for evaluation of the responses to the solicitation.

<DESC>Amendment 02 posted 22 August 2007.<br>Amendment 01 posted 16 August 2007. Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.  Personnel qualifications ? the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced professional personnel in several specific disciplines for technical roles.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 541511 are invited to participate in this competitive procurement.  Teaming and/or Joint Ventures are also encouraged. Solicitation number N61339-07-R-0057 has been assigned to this procurement.  Upon release, the solicitation will be posted to the NAWCTSD World Wide Web Site at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/contract/procure.htm.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED UNDER ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF MULTIPLE (UP TO EIGHT (8)) COMBINATION FIRM-FIXED PRICE (FFP) CONTRACTS WITH PROVISION FOR ORDERING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) WORK.  THE CONTRACTS WILL BE AWARDED TO SUCCESSFUL SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS.  The scope of work for task orders competed under these IDIQ contracts will primarily be for remedial action services at environmentally contaminated sites predominantly located at Navy and Marine Corps installations and other government agencies. These sites will consist of those ranked on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL) as well as non-NPL sites regulated under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and various state and federal Underground Storage Tanks (UST) regulations, as well as other sites which might require remedial action.  The contaminants will include, but not be limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL), ordnance waste or unexploded ordnance.  A relatively small number of sites may require remediation of radiological media.  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactive, non-explosive ordnance residues or compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.  The work will primarily include actions such as: 1) performing remedial actions, 2) performing removal and demolition activities, 3) performing expedited and emergency response actions at sites, 4) performing pilot and treatability studies, 5) providing facility operation, maintenance and instruction of designed remedial systems, 6) performing other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels, and 7) developing various remedial action work plans. The work will be performed in two distinct areas identified by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 excluding Florida (with most work occurring in Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina) and EPA Region 6 (with most work occurring in Texas and Louisiana).   This procurement is being advertised on a small business set-aside basis.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 562910, Environmental Remedial Actions.  The Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The Federal Supply Code is Y300, Construction/Restoration.

The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement.  The Two-Phase RFP procedures will be utilized for this procurement in accordance with FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors? proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the government.

Offerors will be evaluated on the following technical factors:  

Factor A ? Past Performance
Factor B ? Capability of Key Personnel/Corporate Experience
Factor C - Management and Technical Approach/Schedule

<SUBJECT>A -- DTRA Nuclear Weapons Effects Simulator Support
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HDTRA2-08-C-0000
<RESPDATE>100107
<ARCHDATE>10202007
<CONTACT>ROBERT STUART, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 505-846-8457, Fax 505-846-4246, Email Robert.Stuart@abq.dtra.mil
<DESC>The Pre-Solicitation Notice is amended to read:
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Contracting Office, Albuquerque, NM intends to award a single source contract to L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation.  A previous notice for sources sought for this requirement was posted Mar 29, 2007 under reference number HDTRA2-08-C-0000.

The objective for this nuclear weapons effects (NWE) Test Support contract is to provide for the continued availability of all of the DTRA NWE simulators in support of U.S.  Government agency NWE testing and commercial businesses needs.  DTRA NWE simulators are currently located at the L-3 Communications Titan Corporations facility in San Leandro, California, and DTRA does not intend to relocate the simulators at government expense.  The contractor will be responsible for the economic viability of its simulator operations, and for marketing and contracting of test capabilities to potential customers, in conjunction with performing the tasks described in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The draft SOW will be made available to interested parties upon request.

DTRA conducts a broad spectrum of specialized test support for DoD nuclear systems survivability programs and the DOE Stockpile Stewardship program.  This effort requires operation and maintenance of DTRAs Double-EAGLE (25 kJ, > 3KeV photons over > 300 cm^2 Cold X-rays; 0.2 to 1.2 MeV, 65 krad(Si), 1.2 x 10^12 rad(Si)/s over 100 to 2,000 cm^2 Hot X-rays), Pithon (0.2 to 1.5 MeV, 60 krads(Si) and 1.3 x 10^12 rad(Si)/s over 2000 cm^2, and Modular Bremsstrahlung Source (MBS) (25J, 30 rad(Si), 1 x 1^9 rad(Si)/s over 1,000 cm^2 Normal Warm X-rays; and 53J, 45 rad(Si), 1 x 10^9 rad(Si)/s over 1,000 cm^2 High Fluence Warm X-rays) Simulators.  This effort also requires provision of a gamma-ray output capability (5MV, 4.5MeV, 2.0 x 10^3 rad[Si], 4.0 x 10^10 rad[Si]/s over 3,000 cm^2).  In addition this effort requires the operation and maintenance of the Simulator Operating System, Data Acquisition System, and DTRA-owned hardware associated with the L-3 Titan Pulserad 1150 simulator.  Results derived from these activities shall be captured through comprehensive documentation.  DTRA will not pay the contractor for these services.  These services will be funded by customer test fees.  The contractor shall operate and maintain DTRAs x-ray simulator capabilities to support customer testing.  This may include, but is not limited to, providing engineering and scientific support to test customers; assisting in test design, data collection and analysis; performing routine maintenance and repairs on DTRA simulators; maintaining an adequate stock of spare parts and an active inventory control system; keeping detailed configuration control records of changes to simulators; performing upgrades to simulators to meet near-term test customer requirements; maintaining an archive of test data; operating and maintaining the simulator control system and data acquisition system; and facility security and Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) programs.  In exchange for these services the contractor will be permitted to use the above Government Property (GP) to independently enter into and perform separate contracts with federal agencies, defense contractors, and commercial businesses to provide test support, test time, and upgrades.  The contractor will be responsible for the economic viability of its simulator operations and marketing and contracting of test capabilities to potential customers.

The subject contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Contract award is anticipated for 21 December 2007.  This synopsis does not constitute an invitation for bids (IFB) or a request for proposals (RFP) and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government.  GPE numbered note 22.

<DESC>The following information is provided in response to questions/comments posed: Forms SF LL, 3002, and 1423 may be filled in by hand and scanned in, to be  included as pictures in your proposal.  This replaces the instruction (point 3  of amendment 0007 to inlcude fill-ins to 17 and 18 of the 1423 as text in your  proposal. Instruction set forth in clause ARDEC 68 (c) need not be submitted with your  proposal. Question: In paragraph 3.1.2, for voulme II, on pg. 56, it indicates that there  shall be an index for volume II.  Volume I (Executive Summary) is an indez for  Volume II, therefore, it seems there is no need for a separate index just for  Volume II.  If a separate index is required, does it count towards the 25 page  limit? Answer: An index must be broken out for all volumes or there must be a master  index for the entire proposal.  It does count towards the 25 page limit. Question: I would like to know what is included in the 25 page length of the  proposal.  Per Section L. Par 2.2.1 (p 54), it indicates that âGovernment  imposed administrative requirements (e.g. Title pages, Table of Contents, List  of Figures, and Drawings, etc.) are not included in the page count.â  Volume I  is essentially a Table of Contents, is Volume I included in the 25 page length? Answer: As per Section L. Par 2.2.1 a Table of Contents does not count agains  the 25 page limit. Question: On p. 56, paragraph 3.1.1, instr, âaâ, states âA Master Index that  identifies the location of all major topics provided in Volumes II and II.â   Should âIIIâ be âIVâ?   Answer: It should read âA Master Index that identifies the location of all  major topics provided in Volumes II, III, and IV.â The Government does not anticipate answering any questions after Thursday, 30  August 2007.

The Government is currently performing market research to determine if there are vendors who are capable of performing the requirement.  The results of the market research will aid the Government in developing its acquisition strategy for this procurement.   The Government intends to award an ID/IQ contract (s) with one base year ordering period and four one year options, under which firm fixed price task orders may be awarded for various medical equipment and associated services.  It is also the Government' s objective to provide maximum practicable opportunities under this anticipated acquisition to qualified small business concerns, if available.

If after review of all responses, the Government determines that there are not enough qualified firms to  perform this requirement; the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted requirement to be procured under full and open competition procedures.

<DESC>1 EA. (45) TCS-061-KU-2.000-CR-GG1-B2CSR-BB
FEATURES: Microsecond response to metal wall surface temperature changes*allows very short duration testing*available probe diameters from .015 inch*precise location of thermocouple*rugged renewable junctions*withstand high pressure and heat flux*
Applications: Wind Tunnel model surface temperature and heat flux measurement*inside surface temperatures of:engine cylinders*air compressors*gun barrels*bearings*die casting dies*blast effects on structures*laser target surface temperatures
Coaxial thermocouples are used for microsecond response time surface termperature measurements of metal walls in the above applications and many others.  They are coaxial thermocouples consisting of a small wire of one thermocouple material coated with a .C005 thickness of a special ceramic insulation of high dielectric strength weaged securely in a tube of a second thermocouple material.  The insulation resistance between the wire and the tube is effective to more than 1500 degrees celisuis at steady state.  The thermocouple junction is formed by vacuum depositing a metallic coating of one to two microns thickness over the sensing end of the probe, forming a metallurgical bond. A variety of mounting configurations and transition pieces for lead wire connections may be installed on the coaxial probe assembly.

(a)  An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party.

(b)  Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c)  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784.

(d)  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

(e)  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

                                                                  (End of clause)

<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001
<RESPDATE>091307
<ARCHDATE>09282007
<CONTACT>Louis Kuta, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8024, Fax 301-402-0178, Email kutal@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

Semi-annual progress reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract.  The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month.  Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months.  A semi-annual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.  Semi-annual progress reports shall include any changes in Contractor personnel, the number of staff-hours committed to the contract project for the reporting period, the source and number of data points entered into the database for each species, a summary of revisions to the codebook completed during the reporting period, a list of investigators who received login passwords to the database, a list of publications resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.

A final report shall be submitted to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) on or before completion of this contract.  The final report shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including the number of data points entered for each species, investigators who received the database, publication resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.  Two (2) copies (CDs) of the most up-to-date version of the database shall be submitted to the Project Officer with the final report.

Interested small businesses are invited to submit a capability statement addressing the ability to satisfy the requirement.  The capability statement should reference sources sought synopsis number NIHAG2007001 and should be no longer than 15 pages in length (personnel qualifications are not included in page count) and shall include the following:  (1) name and address of the company; size standard and small business program status of the company as listed under www.ccr.gov; (2) point of contact with name, title, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address; (3) DUNS number; (4) contractor's capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability, knowledge, and experience specific to the requirements set forth in the draft statement of work; (5) lists of three clients to whom similar types of services have been previously provided within the last three years to include contract number, dollar value, and name and telephone number of point of contact; and (6) qualifications and experience of any key personnel likely to perform directly under any resultant contract.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the experience, expertise, and qualifications to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is exploring the availability of commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to lighter weight alternatives to the current steel alloy Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft MB-1 and MB-2 (10,000 and 25,000 pound capacities, respectively) cargo tie-down chain/device combinations (found in Detail Military Specifications (Mil-DTL)-6458E and -25959).  The intent of this initiative is to reduce aircraft operating weight to improve MAF fuel efficiency.  The lighter weight alternative tie down sought must perform to the general performance specifications contained in section 4.5 of Mil-DTL-6458E and section 4.7 of Mil-DTL-25959F (attached separately).  Any reference to specific materials, mechanisms, or assemblies can be disregarded in lieu of proposed new lighter weight device.  Through this RFI, the Air Force is requesting information concerning technologies which meet the requirements previously stated.

<DESC>RFI FOR FLIGHT GLOVES

Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Systems (NAVAIR-PMA202) of Patuxent River, MD seeks information on commercially available Fire-Resistant Flyers Gloves for Naval and Marine Corps Aviators and Aircrew.  Such flyers gloves may be considered as possible replacements or alternatives for the current US Navy and Marine Corps GS/FRP-2 Fire-Resistant Summer Flyer?s Glove used by all Navy and Marine Corps Aviators and Aircrew.  The primary function of the flight glove is to provide protection in the event of an aircraft fire or ejection.  Aviators and aircrew don the gloves before flight operations in all climates and keep the glove on for the duration of the mission.  NAVAIR is seeking new gloves that have enhanced tactility and dexterity as well as providing at least the same protection and the functionality of the glove(s) it replaces.  The general requirements for the Summer Fire Resistant Flyer?s Glove are:

1) Flame resistant. Nomex Simplex Knit fabric is currently used to manufacture the summer glove. All product information submitted must meet or exceed the following Thermal Protective Performance (TPP) values: 

Time to 1st degree burn: 4.6 sec 
Time to 2nd degree burn: 4.8 sec 
Max Skin Temp: 119 deg C (9.6 sec) 
Max Fabric Temp: 386 deg C (6.0 Sec) 


The vertical flame requirements for this fabric are as follows: 
After flame (max): 2.0 sec 
Char Length (max): 4 inches
 
Ability to meet or exceed the above requirements shall be documented in the information submitted.

2) Increased wet and dry tactility.  Increased fingertip tactility to allow accurate operation of cell phone or calculator-size buttons and Navy touch screens.   Increased wet grip to allow secure grip on wet slick surfaces such as oily metal aircraft handholds, wet rubber rafts, etc 

3) Increased durability.   The gloves shall provide longer use life when compared to the GS-FRP/2 flyers glove when the user completes the same mission tasks.

4) Gauntlet: At least a 3 inch long gauntlet and no longer than 5 inches.  

5) Provides protection in hot/warm/moderate temperatures.  The glove sought need not provide thermal protection in all climates but must limit elevated hand skin temperature in hot weather.   

6) Sizes.  Shall be available in the same range of sizes as the current flyer?s glove; sizes 4 to 12.

7) Static dissipative.  Must be manufactured of materials that dissipate static. 

8) Snag and puncture resistant.  

Specification sheets, drawings and photographs are requested from all interested sources at no cost to the Government.  Product information shall be submitted at no expense to the Government and will not be returned. Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected in accordance with the Uniform Trades Secret Act.  Interested sources shall state whether their product is available commercially, made domestically of domestic textiles (must be Berry compliant ? manufacturers must list the origin and place of manufacturing operations of all components).  

Companies responding to this request for information should send all responses to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT (Air 2.4.3.3), ATTN: Jeanette Moronta, Code 2.4.3.3.4, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg 2272 Room 353, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127.

Please address all technical questions to Kelcy Seabolt, Code 4.6.7.4, (301) 342-8379.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  This announcement is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be synopsized separately.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) is posting this sources sought notice on behalf of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO).  Notice of Sources Sought for Equipment which is a combination of accelerated Network Interface Cards (NICs) and modified nProbe netflow generation software that can take advantage of the full speed of the accelerated NICs.  The nProbe software will only work with nProbe accelerated NICs.  This procurement supports the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).  It provides two components, accelerated NICs and specially modified software that takes full advantage of the NICs acceleration capabilities.  These two components will be used in multiple servers per site as part of the NOAA Enterprise NIDS deployment.  This component is a crucial piece in providing the ability to deploy a variety of NIDS technologies to inspect the data.  NOAA's current enterprise NIDS deployment cannot support the anticipated increase in network utilization and network upgrades which will occur over the course of the next 3 years. In addition, the anticipated network upgrades and network utilization exceeds current IDS vendor offerings resulting in the need for the N-CIRT to engineer a solution. This solution adequately provides necessary coverage and has the flexibility to increase capacity if demand exceeds current expectations. This flexibility in the solution engineered by the N-CIRT minimizes the impact of overall cost at the larger installations if the anticipated increase in bandwidth utilization exceeds current predictions. Npulse Networks equipment:  2-port Gigabit XD Adapter Card (RJ45); 4-port Gigabit XL Adapter Card (RJ45); Subscription for use and support of precompiled nProbe binaries.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND ONE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  Again, this is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received in response to this notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responding firms should provide one (1) electronic copy of a tailored capability statement by 12:00pm EST, Wednesday, September 5, 2007 via email to Matthew.Courtad@noaa.gov. Reference: ?NOAA Enterprise NIDS - Sources Sought? in the subject line. If there are any Small Businesses that may be Veteran or Women-owned that can provide this equipment at the performance needed by NOAA, a complete set-aside may be considered for this procurement.

<SUBJECT>A -- High-throughput Collection of Gene Expression Data in Developing Rhesus Macaque Brain
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SS-NIMH-08-0001
<RESPDATE>091307
<ARCHDATE>09282007
<CONTACT>Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov - Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov
<DESC>On behalf of the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of providing contract services for a new initiative entitled: High-throughput Collection of Gene Expression Data in Developing Rhesus Macaque Brain.

This contract will require high throughput collection of gene expression data, and development of a digital brain atlas and associated informatics tools for the analysis of gene expression in specific regions of developing Rhesus macaque brain.  More specifically this contract would utilize high throughput, automated histological processing of samples from the developing Rhesus macaque brain, including sectioning, histological staining, and in situ hybridization, resulting in the generation of high resolution gene expression data related to cytoarchitecture which will be represented in a publicly-available digital brain atlas with associated informatics tools, to facilitate data searches and analyses by other investigators.

Tissues for analysis under this contract will be obtained via a separate contract (to be established), with a facility that has access to well-defined colonies of rhesus macaques, raised in naturalistic settings, where the lineage and hierarchical status of each animal is characterized in detail. This other facility will prepare and transfer the tissues to this contract facility for histological processing and digitization as described above. This contractor will be required to work effectively and closely with the animal facility contractor.

As the lead institute for this Blueprint project, NIMH is seeking to pursue a systematic approach to elucidate gene expression during normal brain development, an identified research area of need with great significance for human health and disease.  The recent sequencing of the genome of the Rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, as well as its broad application as a research model, suggest that this nonhuman primate species would provide the optimal translational bridge between existing gene expression atlases in other species, including mouse, and future efforts in human.

NIMH?s overall goal for this contract is to develop a publicly available data resource to stimulate research in gene expression during normal brain development.  It is anticipated that this resource in general will significantly advance knowledge of gene expression in developing primate brain, and provide a template for future studies in developing human brain. It is also anticipated that there will be some form of continued support of this publicly available digital atlas, database, and associated informatics tools, following contract completion.  

To successfully accomplish the goals of this contract, capable organizations must demonstrate expertise in: 1) neurobiology; 2) both automated and high throughput histological processing, including in situ hybridization; and 3) development of digital atlases of gene expression, associated informatics tools, and web-based dissemination of data.

The contract will require a validated HTP methodology regarding:  probe design, sensitivity, variability, reproducibility and quality control.  Therefore, the HTP technique/procedure must be: 1) a reliable validation of gene expression at the level of cellular resolution within specific structures across developmental stages; and 2) scalable, such that additional genes could be included for analysis in specific brain regions if so desired.

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the above work. Capability Statements should clearly state/describe: 1) the offerors experience and qualifications to perform this work; 2) your type of business or organization, its size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (Note:  the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541710, 500 employees); 3) your the management structure, history of your organization (for example number of years in business and DUNS #); and 4) any other resources available to perform this work (e.g. scientific equipment, laboratory facilities, etc.). 

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RECEIPT NOTICE WILL BE SENT TO THE SUBMITTER OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT AND NO EVALUATION WILL BE PROVIDED OF ANY RESPECTIVE CAPABILITY STATEMENT.

If the Government decides to issue a solicitation, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available solely via the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It will be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any solicitation and amendments, and to download the RFP and all attachments.

Responses to this notice should be received no later than the specified due date, and can be sent either by mail, fax, or e-mail to the Point of Contact listed.  If using the U.S. Postal Service or commercial overnight services, please send an original plus five (5) copies of your response. Note: for commercial overnight services, use the Rockville, MD 20892 address.

This modified M201A1 fuze, designated the M208,  is a pyrotechnic, delay-igniting fuze that will be used for further engineering testing and evaluation. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety pin and pull ring assembly. The safety pin is removed to arm the device. When the lever is released, the sprin g-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer. The primer ignites the delay element, ignition charge, starter mixture, and on to the main charge. This survey is being conducted to evaluate fuze manufacture, testing and engineering support capabilities as well as experience with pyrotechnic formulations to produce a modified M201A1/M208 baseline design. For purposes of this survey, 500 fuzes are requ ired for further engineering analysis and evaluation. The modified M201A1/M208 fuze is being researched based on similarity with the M201A1 manufacturing and pyrotechnic skills and production processes. Additional information regarding the above items can be requested from the below point of contact. The potential contract may require the contractor to: a) Develop or modify fuze tooling, fixtures and production processes, similar to those used on the M201A1 fuze, to produce the components. b) Develop or modify gauges and fixtures, similar to those used on the M201A1 fuze, and a plan to inspect the components to Department of Defense requirements. A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical capability and skills similar to the M201A1 fuze, manufacturing and testing capability similar to the M201A1 fuze, certification to receive export-controlled techni cal data (as applicable), and good past performance in the pyrotechnic processing industry, as an indicator of qualifications.

<SUBJECT>D--Upgrade Computerized Hydraulic Navigation Gate Operating System and Provide Routine Maintenance and Emergency Repair Services at the Stamford Hurricane Barrier in Stamford, Connecticut
<SOLNBR>W912WJ-07-X-0021
<RESPDATE>090507
<ARCHDATE>11042007
<CONTACT>David Dilks, 978-318-8869
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine the interest, availability, and capability of companies, including but not limited to Small, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Bu siness (SDVOSB), and HUBZone concerns, and Large Businesses to upgrade the computerized hydraulic navigation gate operating system and to provide routine maintenance and emergency repair services as required at the Stamford Hurricane Barrier in Stamford, C onnecticut.       The Stamford Hurricane Barrier was built over 40 years ago, and is operated to protect approximately 600 acres of residential and commercial property to include some of the principal manufacturing plants and business offices of the City against floodi ng resulting from storm tides.  The Federally maintained portion of the project extends easterly from the chain link fence at the terminus of the West Branch Dike across the mouth of the East Branch navigation channel and terminates at the eastern limit of  the East Branch Dike.  This portion of the project includes rock-faced earth dikes, the East Branch pumping station, and a 90-foot wide by 35-foot high navigation gate.  This flap-type gate is hinged across the bottom and normally lies flat on the channel  bed.  During potential flood situations, the navigation channel is closed by raising the gate into a vertical position, synchronous with the tide cycles.       In 1997, the original chain and gear drive operating system for the navigation gate was replaced with a hydraulic operating system designed and built by Bosch-Rexroth Corporation.  The navigation gate is presently raised and lowered by two 20-inch di ameter, 65-foot stroke telescoping hydraulic cylinders, one on each side of the navigation channel. Each cylinder is independently powered by a dedicated hydraulic power unit consisting of a 400 gallon reservoir, two variable speed 40 hp hydraulic fluid pu mps, and associated heaters, circulating pump, gauges, valves, and appurtenances. The hydraulic system is operated by a programmable logic controller (PLC) with a personal computer (PC) interface which monitors all aspects of the hydraulic systems on both sides of the gate, and automatically corrects system flow rates to prevent gate skew.  Operating software is Disk Operating System (DOS) based Windows 3.1, and there is presently no back-up, except for a manual operating panel. Anticipated Scope of Work 	1.  The PLC, PC, and navigation gate operating software are obsolete and need to be replaced.  In addition, the following upgrades to the gate operating system are desired: * The new system shall allow the user to fully monitor and operate the gate, and modify system software from remote locations at Hop Brook Lake in Middlebury, CT, and New England District (NAE) Headquarters in Concord, MA, all via an existing Local Area Ne twork (LAN).  This will require firms to familiarize themselves with the Information Technology (IT) and security protocols as the system must be compatible and in conformance with these IT and security protocols. * The new system shall provide expanded alarm and trouble shooting capabilities with verbal messages to the operators which direct them to specific malfunctioning equipment, including individual fuses and circuit breakers. This function will require extens ive hardware additions, including monitoring devices and their associated wiring. * The new system shall have the capability to record and store data from all gate operations to the PC hard drive so that it can be easily accessed both locally and remotely, and printed or transferred to other electronic storage media. 	2.  In addition to the PLC/PC upgrades described above, a service contract is required which will provide for routine annual maintenance of the entire hydraulic operating system including: telescoping cylinders, filters, hydraulic power units, piping, val ves, manifold assemblies , position indicating devices, PLCs, PC, and software.  24-hour emergency troubleshooting and repair service capability for all this equipment is also required.  Contractor Capabilities 	Firms responding to this announcement shall demonstrate in writing their capability to meet the requirements stated below.  Responses shall include lists of similar work performed by the firm in the last five years, along with current points of contact fo r each job, and shall:   	1.  demonstrate the firm's experience and ability to provide software and hardware to upgrade the computerized navigation gate hydraulic operating system as described in the scope of work above, 	2.  demonstrate the firm's experience and ability to provide routine annual maintenance on the entire navigation gate operating system including mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical portions of the system, 	3.  demonstrate the firm's experience and ability to troubleshoot and provide 24 hour emergency repairs within 4 hours (including parts and labor) on the entire navigation gate operating system including mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical portions of t he system. 	4.  demonstrate the firms experience and ability to coordinate with an IT contractor to integrate the mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical portions of the gate operating system with the IT portion. 	Responses are required no later than 5 September 2007.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  David Dilks (Contracts Branch).  Firms interested shall prov ide the documentation, in one original form and one copy.  Responses shall be limited to 10 pages and shall include the firms small business status, if any.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code identified for this work is 5415 12 with a size standard of $23,000,000.00.  The government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from t he date of this notice.  Please note that this is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>R--Technical Support Services for Reston, Virginia and Rolla, Missouri for the National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC)
<DESC>Contract No. 02HQCN0008 was competitively awarded to Harris Technical Services Corp. (formerly The Orkand Corporation) to provide technical support services for the National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC) in various USGS locations throughout the United States. The contract ends September 30, 2007.  The positions for the USGS in Reston and Rolla were identified in the A-76 competitive sourcing study targeted for award September 2007. The study was cancelled in June 2007 and therefore those positions will be vacant starting October 1, 2007. Due to an inadequate amount of time to conduct acquisition planning and the need to continue support of critical systems, the USGS intends to extend the period of performance on the existing contract for an additional six months while a new competition is being conducted for the follow-on contract. This extension is only for those positions affected by the A-76 study. This notice is for informational purposes only. Request for Proposal (RFP) is not available. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this action.

General information about lead poisoning -- http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/faq/about.htm
Chemical agent briefing sheet on mercury -- http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cabs/mercury/index.html

The vendor will deliver the multimedia products in a format that can be downloaded from the CDC website and distributed on DVD.  Additionally, the vendor will have each product reviewed by an expert panel convened by the vendor.

<SUBJECT>R -- Special Security support Services
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order with Lockheed Martin Information Technologies (LMIT) for Special Security Office Support services. Macdill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to LMIT under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the existing agency requirements, for the following reasons stated in the J&A: 

a.  USCENTCOM J2 requires continued Personnel Security Program, Information Security Program, and Physical Security services. An acquisition is currently underway to provide these services through the USARMY Communications and Electronics Command (CECOM) CE-LCMC, Rapid Response Project Office, BLDG 295, FT Monmouth, NJ 07703. We are tracking to have a new contract vehicle in place by 31 August 2007. Lockheed Martin is the only reasonable contractor that can provide the continued service without causing a break in critical mission services.  They will not require time to ramp up their manpower to current levels nor will they require valuable time to adapt to the learning curve.  Providing the bridge contract will ensure critical security requirements are met with no break in service.

b.  This request is to cover our requirement up to 25 days should the award of the new contract be delayed beyond 31 August 2007.  The Personnel Security program is a joint-service personnel security program.  Contractors shall be responsible for administering and tracking EPSQ for over 1500 Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) coded positions and approximately 700 collateral positions assigned to USCENTCOM.  The Information Security Program is a Department of Defense security program.  Contractors shall be responsible for ensuring USCENTCOM compliance with Information Security Program Regulations and Directives.  The Contractor shall provide technical expertise regarding physical security infrastructure, and physical security as it relates to systems, and building construction.  Contractor shall assist the Special Security Office (SSO) in the writing and formulation of accreditation packages required to document the physical security characteristics of USCENTCOM facilities.  Contractor shall be required to assist in the evaluation of technical specifications, and other related documentation required in the formulation of accreditation packages.  The Contractor shall not exercise personal judgment on behalf of the Government.  Continued contractor support in the areas of personnel, information, and physical security are critical to the continued security operations at USCENTCOM.
	 
C. LMIT has provided the critical SSO support over the past four years and has a full understanding of the USCENTCOM SSO requirements.  Continuing the support of their expertise for 25 day period of performance until a new contract is in place is critical to ensure SSO functions are provided. An acquisition to provide a new contract vehicle is being administered by CECOM R2 Project Office which should be completed in the near future. Using the current in-place LMIT Vendor to provide up to a 25 day bridge will allow for a smooth transition, and avoid a break in service.  This announcement constitutes the only announcement. A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 511210  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7372 with a small business size of $23 million.

<SUBJECT>B -- Enhanced Sigma-0/Wind Speed Retrievals from ASCAT
<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE:  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intent to contract by other than full and open competition in the development of Ultra High Resolution (5km) Wind Retrievals from an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). NOAA intends to award a sole source a contract to Brigham Young University, A-285 Administration Building, Provo, UT 84602. The anticipated contract will be a follow on cost reimbursable contract and will be for 12 months.  The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 541710, size standard is 500 employees.  

The work to be performed is for the development and evaluation of enhanced resolution techniques applicable to ASCAT and incorporated ASCAT enhanced resolution products into NOAA?s near real time ASCAT processing system. Resolution enhancement algorithms such as those used with QuikSCAT for making enhanced resolution sigma-0 images and subsequent wind speed images over Tropical Cyclones (TC) can also be applied to ASCAT on The Meteorological Operational Satellite Program (METOP). Experimental QuikSCAT products for ultra high resolution ocean sigma-0 images and ultra high resolution wind retrieval have been developed. NOAA has adopted and transitioned the enhanced resolution processing technique into the near real time QuikSCAT processing system. Ultra high resolution wind speed products and sigma-0 imagery are routinely produced for TC systems based on a storm card file generated with input form the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. 

The contract will utilize the services of Brigham Young University for research and development.  Brigham Young provides unique experience and expertise that is unavailable within NESDIS.  Only they can provide the computations that needed. Brigham Young University has a long collaboration history with NOAA and its institutes.  

Both ultra high resolution ocean sigma-0 images and ultra high resolution wind retrieval systems have been developed by Brigham Young University.  Therefore Brigham Young University would play a critical role in our project which relies heavily on work they have a demonstrated expertise in.  They have a team of scientists working on ultra high resolution algorithms.  They also have an expert ultra high resolution ocean sigma-0 images and ultra high resolution wind retrieval systems. Therefore Brigham Young University plays a critical role in this project which relies heavily on their expertise.  Because of Brigham Young University?s extensive experience they are the only appropriate contractor for this project.

Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a notice of intent to sole source only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NOAA. NOAA will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements.  Vendors who believe they have this capability should respond in accordance with Numbered Note 22.     The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Solicitation of interest involving Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag and system testing
<DESC>INTERESTED VENDORS SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM TO TEST RADIOFREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TAGS AND SYSTEMS OF CERTAIN SHIPMENTS.                        

EPA is seeking interested RFID vendors to participate in a program to test a unique use of RFID for shipping certain chemicals/materials from generator to receiver.  The shipping scenario would include checkpoints along the way, including across North American borders.  

The project offers multiple challenges, including:  Tag data should be capable of capture in an information-management system.  Read range should be 5-10 feet, with 100% read capability through metal, liquid, solids, and viscous materials; tags should be resistant to environmental factors, including heat, humidity, impact, vibration, acids, dirt, and radiation; individual item tagging in a pallet packing configuration, with approaching 100% unobstructed read rate; the use of multiple storage facilities and trucking firms; tracking at choke-points along the travel route.  System security is vital.  

Selected vendors would have the freedom to design the tagging configuration and the type of tags used, and we are looking for innovative solutions for this difficult shipping scenario.  

This program is being carried out under EPA's Environmental and Sustainable Technology Evaluation (ESTE)/Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program, and is a partial cost-sharing program.  The project is targeted to high-risk Agency needs, and will have high visibility.  Results of the testing will be verified by the USEPA and will be published.  EPA will initiate and directly manage verifications of up to 10 potential vendors in the first round of testing.  

Questions may be submitted to Julia Capri at Julia.Capri@erg.com by September 14, 2007.  Questions and accompanying answers will be provided to all who have responded.  JULIA CAPRI IS THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS SOLICIATION.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control is seeking a qualified vendor with the required technical skills and resources to collect and analyze data related to youth 10-15 exposed to media violence. This data will support and further the understanding of the co-occurrence of exposure to media violence and engaging in serious criminal and /or aggressive behavior. In addition to supporting the general management of this project, the contractor will support conducting extensive and complex analyses on the longitudinal data from years 1 and 2.
Since the 1950, researchers have been concerned about the effect media violence has on youth behavior and development.  A 1972 US Surgeon General?s report voiced this concern to the scientific community.  The 1980s and 1990s were marked with laboratory and field experiments attempting to parse out the role movies, television, and video games played in aggressive attitudes and behaviors.  Findings contributed to the 2002 US Surgeon General report on Youth Violence.   Today, there is general agreement in the scientific community that viewing violence, at least for some children, increases aggressive attitudes, values, and behaviors.  Even with this prolific research activity, gaps in our understanding of the relationship between media violence and aggressive behavior remain.  First, despite substantial evidence of short-term effects of media violence on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, little research has considered the link with seriously violent or criminal behavior.  Second, effects of media violence on aggressive behavior seem to be particularly pronounced for younger children; little research has considered the link for older children and adolescents. Third, with increased use of the Internet among young people, little is known about how exposure to violence on the Internet fit into our growing understanding of the effect of violent mediums.  The Internet is fast becoming the telephone of the 21st century, with an estimated 97% of young people between the ages of 12 and 18 using online communication.  Because almost all youth are now online, this access may have increased opportunities for children and youth to be exposed to violence.  Websites such as hate pages that encourage discrimination of specific types of people, and those reporting ?real? violence such as news websites have the potential to reinforce cognitive styles and orientations that support aggressive responding, thereby increasing the perpetration of seriously violent behavior.	
The contractor will be responsible for media violence exposure data collection, statistical analyses and dissemination of findings from Media Violence data. 1.) Clean and analyze Year 2 media violence data. 2.) Management and oversight of Year 3 Media Violence data collection.	Period of performance will be 1 year.
	Deliverables
	1. Media violence exposure data file for Year 2 of data collection by 1/31/08.
	2. Summary report of Year 2 media violence exposure data by 4/30/08.
3. Raw data file of Year 3 data by 9/30/08.
The following criteria will be used to evaluate technical proposals: technical Approach - 30 percent, staffing and management- 20 percent and similar experience-50 percent.

Information Assurance shall be in accordance with DFAS 8500.1-R, Information Protection and Safeguards, DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.1, Information Assurance, and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation.  The following requirements apply to the offeror/vendor selected for contract award resulting from this solicitation.  Upon notification of being selected as the successful offeror/vendor, the contractor shall follow the instructions provided at (a) through (e) of this provision, as applicable.

			2.8.2	(a) Magnitude. This contract will require personnel to meet the investigative standards as outlined in DoDI 8500.2 and DoD 5200.2-R for IT-I and IT-II access.  Contractors must be a US citizen, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, Chapter 2, and specifically C2.1.1, General.

		2.8.3      Security Investigation Requirements for Information Technology (IT):

(1) For IT-I: No classified work will be required. However, the contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act or other government regulations and is considered category IT-I.  The contractor must ensure sensitive information is properly safeguarded at the work-site and not removed from the work-site.  In addition, the contractor will be required to comply with the security requirements associated with access to the DFAS enterprise network.  All contractor personnel requiring IT-I access to the DFAS information systems will be the subjects of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  An IT-I position may be occupied pending the completion of the SSBI once the National Agency Check (NAC) portion has been completed and a favorable local eligibility determination made.  A previous National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or an Entrance NAC may be used for emergency appointment, provided a break in service of more than 24 months has not occurred since completion of that investigation and the SSBI has been initiated, and a Waiver of Pre-appointment Investigative Requirements has been granted IAW DoD 5200.2-R. 

    		2.8.4    Documentation Submission. The NACLC for IT-II, as well as the SSBI for IT-I, requires contractor submission of the following investigative forms:

Standard Form 85P (SF 85P) - Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
FD 258 - Fingerprint Card

All contractor personnel requiring either IT-I or IT-II access to the DFAS information systems will complete a SF 85P.  The SF 85P will be completed using the Adobe Fillable version located at http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp .  The completed/signed SF85P will be provided to the Contract Officer?s Representative (COR) or Government Point of Contact (GPOC) elsewhere named in this solicitation.  All SF 85Ps must be accompanied with the FD 258 Finger Print Card and a copy of the contractor?s birth certificate or U.S, Passport for citizenship verification.  Naturalized US citizens must provide the original Certificate of Naturalization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) or a U.S. Passport.  The SF85P along with the FD258 will be forwarded to the local Site Security Liaison (SSL) for review and submission.  The SSL will notify the COR/GPOC when the contractor employees have been approved for access to the facility.  The appropriate investigation (NACLC or SSBI) must be completed or an exception waiver approved, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, before the contractor employee begins work on a DFAS contract.   Foreign Nationals must submit appropriate documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  Employment of non-US citizens requires a fully completed background investigation and a favorable local eligibility determination prior to beginning DFAS work, or an exception waiver approved by the Director, DFAS, before the contractor employee begins work on a DFAS contract.

			2.8.5    Waiver Procedures.  

(1)	For IT-I: An IT-I position may be occupied pending the completion of the SSBI once the NAC portion has been completed and a favorable local eligibility determination made, along with an exception waiver that has been approved by the appropriate waiver authority.  Waivers may be approved, provided no potentially disqualifying information is known, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, concerning the contractor employee and all pre-appointment security checks have received favorable determinations by the appropriate DFAS Security Office. 


   		2.8.6     Findings.  All contractor employees must receive a favorable local eligibility determination to work on DFAS contracts.  Unfavorable local eligibility determinations will require the removal of the contractor from the DFAS contract.

SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.  RATIONALE FOR SOLE SOURCE:  DFAS previously contracted for the development of a customized Resume Builder.  WorkForce Technologies created the DFAS Resume Retrieval Application (RRA).  DFAS owns the customization pieces of the application, and DFAS owns the hardware used to host the application.  However, the core Resume Builder product is owned by WorkForce Technologies.  

	DFAS Human Resources is not seeking replacement for the RRA, just maintenance for the existing system.  In order for another vendor to be able to provide the work described in the Statement of Work, a new Resume Builder would need to be delivered, which is outside of the scope of the Statement of Work.

		Since WorkForce Technologies owns the product of the Resume Builder, they are the only source available to modify and enhance the DFAS RRA. While DFAS owns previously developed customized pieces of the RRA, it has not acquired or does not own the rights to the RRA code.  Consistent with DFARS 
227.7202-1(c)(2), DFAS does not have the right to modify commercial software itself or by a third party without the agreement of the owner of the software code.

HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [Jun 2006]   

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Closing Date: 	March 9, 2007
Closing Time: 	2:00 pm (local time)

Subject: Combined Synopsis-Solicitation Notice for Global Architect-Engineer Infrastructure Services

Pursuant to the authority contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau of Economic Growth Agriculture and Trade, Office of Infrastructure and Engineering (USAID/EGAT/I&E) invites submission from all eligible U.S. Professional Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to provide engineering design and construction supervision services ranging from quick response and short and long-term services in the infrastructure areas of water resources, environmental/sanitary engineering, civil and industrial engineering, structural engineering, value engineering, industrial/chemical engineering, power and telecommunications to USAID/Washington and USAID Missions worldwide.

USAID is seeking registered professional engineers and/or licensed A-E firms that are either individual firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, or other legal entities permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering.  USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible U.S. or Non-U.S. organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services.

The selection of the Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm(s) will be conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented by FAR Subpart 36.6. 

As defined in 40 U.S.C. 1102, Architectural and engineering services are:
 (1) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, as defined by State law, if applicable, that are required to be performed or approved by a person licensed, registered, or certified to provide those services; 
(2) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature performed by contract that are associated with research, planning, development, design, construction, alteration, or repair of real property; and 
(3) Those other professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, or incidental services, that members of the architectural and engineering professions (and individuals in their employ) may logically or justifiably perform, including studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, plans and specifications, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, and other related services. 

TYPE OF CONTRACT/PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/ESTIMATED COST:
USAID intends to award a five-year multiple-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with an aggregate ceiling price up to $500 million.  The aggregate ceiling covers all contracts awarded under this solicitation.  USAID anticipates awarding approximately three (3) IQC awards.  The Contracting officer reserves the right to award more or fewer than three awards.  The maximum aggregate dollar value of all task orders awarded to all contractors cannot exceed $500 million.  The ceiling will not be subdivided amongst the contractors.    

Task orders issued under this IQC may be short, medium, or long-term in duration and may be issued by USAID/Washington and USAID/Missions worldwide.  The task orders will be issued using a Fixed Daily Rate format.  The IQC minimum guarantee per award will be $100,000.

SELECTION PROCESS:
USAID will evaluate all offerors based on the evaluation criteria as described below.  Based on the evaluation rankings a list of at least 3 of the most highly qualified firms per FAR Subpart 36.602-(3)(c) will be established.  These most highly qualify firms will be notified that they have been selected for discussions with the A-E evaluation board.  The A-E firms who are selected to participate in the discussions will be given specific guidance and instructions at the appropriate time and will be given approximately 3 weeks to prepare their response regarding concepts relevant to the scope of work.  Any information submitted and/or received during the discussion process may be used as justification for the final ranking of the firms recommended to the Selecting Official to make the final selection, in order of preference, to determine apparent successful offeror(s) prior to cost discussions.  Final selection of the most highly qualified firms and negotiation of the A-E contract will be done in accordance with FAR 36.602-4 and 36-606. 

Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions pertaining to the cost submission to the short-listed firms and those firms will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide a cost submission.  After two (2) weeks from receipt of the initial cost submission, if USAID and the A-E firm(s) are not able to reach an agreement, USAID reserves the right to terminate cost negotiations and to begin negotiations with the next most highly rated A-E firm.  Upon USAID and the selected A-E firms reaching an agreement, USAID will distribute a DRAFT contract for their review.

New programs would not meet NGA's requirements of form, fit, and function, nor could they be placed into our infrastructure quickly and easily.  It would be very costly to introduce new software into our enterprise and would require a lagre amount of time to test new software and to re-train our personnel to use the new programs.

FACTORS FOR AWARD

The source selection will be based on best value principles.  Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror(s) whose proposal provide the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This will be determined by comparing the value of the differences in the technical proposal with the differences in price.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior quality of services than with making an award at a lowest overall cost to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve a slightly higher quality of services.  In the event of substantially technically equal offers, the government will award to the lowest evaluated price.   

The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose quotation conforming to this RFP offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on (1) Technical, (2) Experience, (3) Past Performance and (4) Price.

Factor 1:  Technical Approach

Offers will be evaluated in relation to the Offeror technical approach to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS) Specifications.  Evaluation of Technical Acceptability shall be based on evidence in the quotation of the Offeror?s understanding of the requirement and the soundness of the technical approach.  Quotations shall include a description of the steps that the Offeror will perform to accomplish each task in the PWS, and any supplemental material to describe approaches or sources that the Offeror is aware of that would be leveraged.

Factor 2: Experience 

Offerors must be evaluated on (a) timeliness of performance, (b) quality of services provided, (c) customer satisfaction; (d) awards received for past projects and demonstrated cooperation 

Factor 3: Past Performance

The Offeror MUST provide at least three (3), but preferably five (5) past performance references for SIMILAR contracts/orders completed within the past 3 years, to include the following:

a)  Name of the organization or Agency

b) Named point of contact in the organization or Agency that is familiar with the contract/order from technical or contractual standpoint,

Telephone number, their email addresses, and their fax number of the contact person
c)	Contract Number
d)	Amount of the Contract
e)	Address and telephone number or email address of the Contracting Officer

Factor 4:  Price

Price shall be firm-fixed price proposal for the PWS requirements that traces back to the proposed PWS.  Any discount offered to the Government shall be identified. 

Non-price evaluation factors (1), (2), (3) and (4) are approximately equally important, and non-price evaluation factors, collectively, are approximately equally important to evaluated price.

A Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order shall be awarded to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, evaluated price and other factors considered.

Basis for Award

The objective of the source selection is to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government.  All evaluation factors that will affect contract award and their relative importance are set forth in the solicitation.  The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance.  While Price will not receive an adjectival rating, it shall be evaluated.  Award shall be based on an integrated assessment of offers using all factors in the solicitation.  Award may be made on the basis of initial quotations.

FACTORS FOR AWARD

The source selection will be based on best value principles.  Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror(s) whose proposal provide the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This will be determined by comparing the value of the differences in the technical proposal with the differences in price.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior quality of services than with making an award at a lowest overall cost to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve a slightly higher quality of services.  In the event of substantially technically equal offers, the government will award to the lowest evaluated price.   

The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose quotation conforming to this RFP offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on (1) Technical, (2) Experience, (3) Past Performance and (4) Price.

Factor 1:  Technical Approach

Offers will be evaluated in relation to the Offeror technical approach to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS) Specifications.  Technical Acceptability:  Evaluation of Technical Acceptability shall be based on evidence in the quotation of the Offeror?s understanding of the requirement and the soundness of the technical approach.  Quotations shall include a description of the steps that the Offeror will perform to accomplish each task in the PWS, and any supplemental material to describe approaches or sources that the Offeror is aware of that would be leveraged.

Factor 2: Experience 

Offerors must be evaluated on (a) timeliness of performance, (b) quality of services provided, (c) customer satisfaction; (d) awards received for past projects and demonstrated cooperation 

Factor 3: Past Performance

The Offeror MUST provide at least three (3), but preferably five (5) past performance references for SIMILAR contracts/orders completed within the past 3 years, to include the following:

a)  Name of the organization or Agency

b) Named point of contact in the organization or Agency that is familiar with the contract/order from technical or contractual standpoint,

Telephone number, their email addresses, and their fax number of the contact person
c)	Contract Number

d)	Amount of the Contract

e)	Address and telephone number or email address of the Contracting Officer

Factor 4:  Price

Price shall be firm-fixed price proposal for the PWS requirements that traces back to the proposed PWS.  Any discount offered to the Government shall be identified. 

Non-price evaluation factors (1), (2), (3) and (4) are approximately equally important, and non-price evaluation factors, collectively, are approximately equally important to evaluated price.

A Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order shall be awarded to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, evaluated price and other factors considered.

Basis for Award

The objective of the source selection is to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government.  All evaluation factors that will affect contract award and their relative importance are set forth in the solicitation.  The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance.  While Price will not receive an adjectival rating, it shall be evaluated.  Award shall be based on an integrated assessment of offers using all factors in the solicitation.  Award may be made on the basis of initial quotations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotation (RFQ), HSCG84-07-Q-3P, incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18. This is an unrestricted procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 611699, size standard is $6.5M. An award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures, in accordance with FAR Part 13, as a firm fixed-price purchase order.

Description: Provide supplies and services to conduct Air Quality Health Risk Assessment, per following Statement of Work (SOW), at the U. S. Coast Guard Sector Houston-Galveston. The period of performance is from 9/24/2007 through 5/23/2008.

SCOPE OF WORK (SOW)

Design and conduct a study to provide SECTOR Houston-Galveston with exposure data and symptom / quality of life data that will be analyzed to identify and determine the statistical significance of short and long term associations or trends that result from working inside the main administrative building.

Associations or trends will include but will not be limited to:
Outdoor and indoor air quality over time;
The concentration ratio of outdoor and indoor airborne chemical contaminants and symptom rates over time;
Association between concentration ratios and quality of life indicators over time; and Any combination of the above variables in relation to each other.

1.2 STUDY / STUDY DESIGN.
Design will combine environmental and symptom survey data that is temporally matched.  Collection of environmental data will be temporally randomized.  Coast Guard will add airborne chemical environmental data to the study that is event-driven; resulting from sampling when there is a known chemical release or a significant odor is detected which signals a chemical release.

One or more local Houston-area Coast Guard control populations are required; at a minimum the USCG Houston air station at Ellington Field will serve as a control.  A control will allow data comparison and determination if relocation would provide a significantly different working environment.  Control data can be selected from environmental, symptom and/or quality of life indicators.

DATA ANALYSIS.
Study data will be analyzed by an Epidemiologist or Biostatistician in conjunction with the study team.

SAMPLING.
Sampling media and/or instruments will be used to collect a sufficient volume of outdoor and indoor air over a pre-determined period and analyzed by a suitable standard methodology.
Sampling will include a statistically significant number of samples.
Sampling will include at least two indoor and one outdoor area.
Sampling will be of sufficient volume and duration to allow a limit of quantification at least equal to the exposure criteria.
The duration of sampling will match the time-averaging period required by the exposure criteria. 
Sampling will include a suitable number of field and media blanks.
Survey ? accomplished via the internet or by email.  Questionnaire will collect building occupant symptoms, metadata, and quality of life indicators.

MEASURES.
Analysis of at least 30 chemicals by commercial or research laboratory.
Chemicals must include: benzene, isopropanol, acetone, xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, styrene, isobutane, 2-heptanone and total hydrocarbons, pyrene, naphthalene and anthracene as indicators of asphalt-based polyaromatic airborne chemicals.

For a period to include the study duration, gather publicly available National Ambient Air Quality Standards data from the closest NAAQS sampling station to Section Houston-Galveston.

Indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentrations by particle size as measured by Coast Guard owned TSI Dustraks.  Particle size discrimination must include PM 2.5.

Indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Symptom Survey ? building occupants will be assigned an online survey account number and will be asked to provide one-time baseline (metadata) information (name, gender, birth date, tenure, position, physical location, work hours, etc?)

Quality of Life Indicators (QLI) ? stress, noise, odors, etc.  Building occupants will provide this information in addition to symptoms.  Noise levels will be assessed during periods of peak outdoor noise associated with the activities of surrounding industrial areas.

EVALUATION CRITERIA.
Evaluation criteria will include acute and chronic criteria from:
Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) health-based Effects Screening Levels (ESL) and ATSDR Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs).

ASSUMPTIONS.
The outdoor air sampling location will be fixed, and close as possible to the outdoor air intake to the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning system(s).  This location will be considered representative of outdoor air locations, even though concentrations of chemicals in other outdoor areas may actually be lower or higher than measured values.

Indoor air sampling locations will be of a number such that they are representative of distinct areas of the building.  For example, distinct floors or separate built environments within the building that house distinct populations of individuals.  These locations will be considered representative of indoor concentrations of chemicals at those locations.

1.3 STUDY TEAM COMPOSITION/STRUCTURE.
U. S. Coast Guard Team: Detached Safety and Environmental Health Officer (SEHO), New Orleans, LA; USPHS Environmental Health Officer (EHO), Norfolk VA; SECTOR Project Coordinator (SPC), Houston; and SECTOR Sampling Coordinator (SSC), Houston.

Contractor Team: Leaders to include an Industrial Hygienist, Occupational Physician,  and Biostatistician or, Epidemiologist. Team leaders must be highly qualified professionals possessing doctorate degrees and be published researchers recognized in their fields as experts in environmental studies dealing with ambient and indoor air quality.

SCHEDULING.
Study team members will develop a sampling schedule that provides data for a six-month period.

SITE VISITS. All prospective contractors are strongly encouraged to do a site visit before submitting quotes/proposals. To arrange a visit, please contact the Project Officer, LCDR Harrichand Rhambarose at (757) 628-4426 or e-mail: Harrichand.Rhambarose@uscg.mil.

The Coast Guard will evaluate quotes/offers and will make a best-value award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote/offer conforms to this solicitation and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on ability to meet basic requirements, delivery, and price.

The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this RFQ, and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Sept 2006), FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Nov 2006), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items (Feb 2007), FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (May 2007), and FAR Clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration.

5.	Question:  As stated under ?Submission Requirements, our SF 330 submittal must be prepared using a font size of Times Roman 12 point. This font size is very limiting, especially considering the template of the 330 form, and is not consistent with the 10 characters per inch requirement. Is it acceptable to change this font size requirement to a proportional spacing Times Roman 10-point font to help us to provide enough information to address all of the requirements of our submittal, especially for the resumes in Section E and project descriptions in Section F? Also, if we provide any summary tables and figures as part of the Section H information, can we use a smaller font size?

Response:  Section H is limited to the two criterions for a total number of 17 pages.

31.       Question:	The 34 specified disciplines do not include program management and logistical support.  Since these are critical functions, especially in first responder tasks, where within the SF330 are these professional qualifications to be detailed? 

        Response:  The program manager discipline has been added to the listing.  The program manager will be responsible for the overall guidance of the contract.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO.: 04 - M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274:

This amendment number 05 revises the Agency?s response to questions 3 and 53 that were posted in Amendment numbers 03 and 04 on February 15, 2007; and incorporates new requirement on Marking and Branding Strategy under ADS 320 under the selection process section.  

3.	Question:  Will all selected firms be required to prepare a proposal for every task order? 

Revised Response:  In limiting the number of awards under this IQC, USAID hopes that most awardees will compete for most task orders.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Revised Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

Please incorporate the following requirement under the Selection Process, second paragraph, and first sentence:

?Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions and the Branding Strategy (BS) to the short-listed firms (see ADS320.3.2.2 and 320.3.2.3). Those firms will be required to submit a cost submission and Branding Implementation Plan and Marking Plan.  They will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide their cost submission.  
				cted firm(s)? 	

Response:  A date has not been established at this time.

42.	Question:  Page 1 of the solicitation indicates that "USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible US or Non-US organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries". We currently have strategic alliances with organizations in a few of these countries. Should we include information on these firms in our response to this solicitation?

Response: Yes, if your organization is considering these organizations to be included as a part of your team.   

43.	Question:  In the Selection Process section, the solicitation states that at least 3 of the most qualified firms will be given 3 weeks to respond "regarding concepts relevant to scope of work." Is this for the Global IQC selection? Or is this for a specific project once the firm has been selected to be on the Global IQC?

Response:  Yes, it?s a part of the evaluation process for the Global IQC.

44.	Question:  In the same Selection Process section, the solicitation states that 3 weeks will be given to provide a cost submission. Is this at the same time as the aforementioned response to the scope of work? Or after the scope of work response has been reviewed?

Response:  After the scope of work response has been reviewed (after the SF330 submittal).  	
45.	Question:  "Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions pertaining to the cost submission to the short-listed firms and those firms will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide a cost submission. After two (2) weeks from receipt of the initial cost submission, if USAID and the A-E firm(s) are not able to reach an agreement, USAID reserves the right to terminate cost negotiations and to begin negotiations with the next most highly rated A-E firm. Upon USAID and the selected A-E firms reaching an agreement, USAID will distribute a DRAFT contract for their review." 

In terms of the general sequence/timing of the evaluation of costs submissions, shouldn?t USAID provide the selected, short-listed A-E firms with a DRAFT contract for review as a part of USAID's request for cost submissions, rather than after reaching an agreement with the firm(s)?  Please clarify USAID's thinking in this area.

Response:  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation USAID will reach an agreement with the firms on the cost proposal prior to distributing the contracts for the firm?s review. 

46.	Question:  Are letters of association permitted/required?

Response:  Yes, letters of commitment are required for subcontractors on your team.

47.	Question:  Are we allowed to include appendices for supplemental information?

Response:  Supplemental information can consist of letters of commitment, graphs, charts, and tables.

48.	Question:  Assuming that USAID awards multiple contracts under this solicitation, please explain how individual task orders will be assigned. Will each task order be subject to competition based on cost or technical capability? Or will USAID use some other process for awarding task orders?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

49.	Question:  Can USAID provide any more specific position requirements for key personnel under this contract? In particular, one of the 34 disciplines listed in Amendment number2 is ?project manager.? Is this intended to be our contract manager key person, and if so, what specific requirements must that manager have, besides the minimum requirements listed in the original solicitation notice, if any?

Response:  No, the project manager is not the contract manager.  The project manager is considered the task order manager and their requirements would vary with the assignment and nature of the task order.  The program manager (discipline number 35) is considered the contract manger.
50.	Question:  In the Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 01 ? Posted on January 24, 2007, under the section entitled ?Type of Contract/Period of Performance/Estimated Cost:?; the award of 3 IQC contracts is anticipated with a 5 year ceiling of $500 million, and the ceiling will not be divided amongst the contract holders. 

How will the selection process work for award of a single task order under the contract? Will each task order or assignment be competed for between the three firms based on fixed daily rates, or some other criteria?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

51.	Question: Will all Rate Schedules quoted for the work be based on $US dollars and daily rates for each individual category of engineer, architect, and support staff? 

Response:  Yes.  There will be a fixed daily rate schedule in the contract that will be in US dollars for each of the 35 disciplines.

52.	Question: Where can we see a copy of the USAID Contract Document, terms and conditions related to Indemnification language and the Limitation of Liabilities associated with Architect-Engineer professional services work? 

Response:  FAR Subpart 36.6 provides information regarding contractor liability/responsibility for design errors or deficiencies.  No limitation of liability clauses are envisioned for this contract.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 50.403, the USG provides indemnification to contractors only in situations where ?unusually hazardous or nuclear risks? are present.  USAID does not intend to provide indemnification to contractors under this contract.  

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.

54.	Question: To receive credit for the 15% small and disadvantaged business concerns that perform work under the team, would that only apply to those who meet that criteria in the US, or could a company in a foreign country who was a team member count if they met the equivalent criteria in their country (thinking of South Africa or similar governments)? 

55.	Response:  No.  Non-U.S. team members can not count equivalent criteria in a foreign country.  Foreign countries are not qualified as small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration.

Response:  The technical instruction for this criterion now requires 35 resumes based on the listed disciplines.  If the offeror does not provide 35 resumes then the offeor will be deemed non-responsive to the requirement.  These 34 resumes can be personnel/consultants from the prime contractor and/or the proposed subcontractors.
 
26.	Question:  Can a resume be used for multiple disciplines? For example, an Environmental Engineer with sufficient experience and a degree that also satisfies the Sanitary Engineer requirements?

Response:  No, one resume cannot be used for multiple disciplines.   The Agency is looking to assess the firm?s broad capabilities.  However, there may be some occasions where a specialist will be required to perform multiple disciplines.   

27.	Question:  The combined synopsis/solicitation for solicitation number M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274 states that A-E firms will be evaluated in accordance with criteria including the following: 1) professional qualifications?....(weight 25 points); and 2) past performance on contracts??..(weight 30 points).  For professional qualifications, bidders are limited to 34 pages (i.e., 34 resumes).  For past performance on contracts, bidders are limited to 10 projects.

Given the depth and breath of the overall architecture and engineering disciplines (water, environment, transport, power, etc.) that will be required to carry out the types of work envisaged under this contract (the transport sector alone, for example, can be disaggregated into more than two dozen sub-disciplines), the evaluation committee would be better informed regarding the capabilities of each bidder if the number of resumes AND projects were expanded to comprehensively demonstrate each bidder?s capabilities in each of the specified disciplines.  Will USAID consider expanding the number of resumes and projects to be submitted in the proposal?

Response: No, USAID will not expand the number of resumes and projects.  As indicated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, 35 resumes (Please see question number 2 where the Program Manager position was added) and 10 projects are required.

?The offeror shall also include estimates for the cost/value of any Government Furnished Property (GFP), and all costs expected to be incurred by the Government associated with providing the equipment, facilities and support necessary to meet the Research and Development requirements?

is amended to read as follows: ?The offeror shall also include estimates for the cost/value of any Government Furnished Property (GFP), and all costs expected to be incurred by the offeror for any proposed GFP that is subsequently not made available by the Government.  The offeror?s cost proposal shall be priced in two ways: the first to utilize ?on-site rates? if proposed GFP is available, and, secondly, priced with ?off-site rates? if proposed GFP in not available.?

QUESTION 2:  Will the Government provide software licenses to the relevant Mathworks products (Matlab, Simulink, toolboxes, real-time workshop, etc.) and compilers (Fortran, C++, etc.) or should they be included in the cost proposal?

ANSWER 2:  Similarly to Answer 1 above, offerors should include the cost of software licensing in their task order proposal, including licensing costs for software and compilers proposed as GFP.  These costs may be eliminated during task order negotiations if made available as GFP.

QUESTION 3:  Should a formal cost proposal be provided for Task Order 1 only or should it also include a detailed cost proposal for the entire contract:

ANSWER 3:  Only Task Order 1 should have a detailed cost proposal and cost summary.

QUESTION 4:  Is there a minimum font size for graphics?

ANSWER 4:  Graphics should be legible without the need for enlargement or magnification.  The font-size of text embedded in graphics should be a minimum of font-size 8 in Arial or Times New Roman, as opposed to font-size 12 for normal print text such as a Microsoft Word document.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Military and Aerospace FPGA Applications Conference NNG07213071Q which was posted on 08/20/2007. You are notified that the following question and answers are posted: 1. How close can the venue be to the airport?  ie. Is an airport hotel too close or preferred? Answer: The hotel should be a short distance convenient for walking to restaurants beyond the hotel. 2. Can you clarify the "labor" needed to staff the AV and registration area? Is this just an on-call person should you experience any issues or do you have extensive AV requirements/equipment to set-up/operate? Answer: A sound engineer primarily someone to watch lighting is needed to staff the AV equipment in the meeting area.  There is no labor needed for the registration area. 3. Will there be a need for any other transportation for conference attendees other than a shuttle service to and from the airport? Answer: The only other required transportation for the attendees of the conference is the Tri-Rail. 4. Do you require, and can we initiate program and sound checks, or a run-through? Answer: A sound check for the speaker podium is needed at a minimum. 5. How many speakers will there be in total, per day?  Will each speaker require their own microphone? Who will be using the wireless lavalieres? Answer: There will be approximately 15 speakers per day.  The speakers will have an option to used the podium or the wireless microphone.   The Session Chair of the conference will use a wireless microphone. 6. Do you require staging?  If so, what size, distance from the audience, on stage seating, etc? Answer: Staging is not required. 7. You mentioned in the RFQ that you require hotel stays for two additional nights before and after the conference.  Do you have an approximate number of guests for these nights? Answer: We require the availability of government room rate for approximately 25-30 guests two days before and after the conference.  8. Guests are required to book / pay for their own rooms.  How far out do you require the venue to hold the room blocks (i.e. deadline date given to attendees to book their rooms for hotel to release the block.) Answer: We require the venue to hold the room blocks for the conference three weeks prior to the conference which is negotiable. 9. Lunch set-up, the RFQ listed a separate room for lunch.  Can the lunch area be a separate section of the main ballroom or does it have to be in a separate room altogether? Answer: A separate room from the meeting room is required for the lunch area. 10. Do you have need for any liability insurance or cancellation insurance? Answer: No. 11. Do you require a "wrap-up" session after the conference, or may we initiate a "wrap-up" session via in-person meeting, phone, or web cast? Answer: No, but we will want to hold a debriefing with the hotel staff. 12. Will there be a printed itinerary/schedule for the conference that we have a copy of prior to the conference? Answer: Yes there will be a printed itinerary/schedule for the conference as soon as venue is chosen. The due date for responses is not extended.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER INTERN PROGRAM.

The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and extend the receipt of offers date as follows: Question 1. Can you specify the ratio of faculty to students in a 12 month period? Answer 1 - There is no set ratio.  NASA intends to select the most qualified students/faculty members for our program. Question 2. Will the stipends be non-taxable? Answer 2 - NASA does not provide a tax exemption.  Suggest you consult your Human Resources or tax professional for guidance in preparing your quote. Question 3.

Does Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plan to provide an on-site coordinator to serve as the day-to-day point of contact to interface with the interns?  Answer 6 - Yes. Question 7.  If the contractor is expected to provide an on-site coordinator, will KSC provide office space, personal computer, phone and other related support for the position? Answer 7 - The Contractor is not required to provide an on-site coordinator.  Therefore, no office space, etc will be provided. Question 8.  Will KSC provide all onsite support functions for interns including orientation, safety briefings, and enrichment activities?  Answer 8 - Yes Question 9.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to revise the period of performance for CLIN 0004 (Consulting Services) under the combined synopsis solicitation (RFQ07-0152) posted on August 14, 2007, at this website, from "not to exceed six months" to "not to exceed four months."  The period of performance for CLIN 0001 thru 0003) remains at 60 days from award. The total period of performance remains at not to exceed six months. In addition this amendment is being issued to post EEOC's response to questions submitted regarding this solicitation. Each response is shown below:

RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS UNDER REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NO. RFQ-07-0152:

Consulting Services: National Contact Center Migration Functional Requirements Analysis, Cost Estimates and Implementation Plan

The following questions and responses apply to RFQ-07-0152:  

QUESTION #1.       What are the contractual obligations and expected support from Vangent in the insourcing effort? 

RESPONSE:   The current contractor, Vangent, will provide for an orderly transfer of all government-owned equipment and information to the successful contractor. 

QUESTION #2.       Please clarify the statement. The contractor shall provide technical and functional solutions to facilitate implementation of the in-house operation at the 15 recommended locations. Does the contractor need to be an actual provider or implementer of solutions (e.g., systems integrator with software and hardware) or can it be one who defines the requirements for EEOC to procure these solutions from another vendor or simply transfer existing software and hardware and manage the overall process?  If you require a systems integrator or hardware/software provider are you open to a teaming arrangement for the contractor to provide these services?

RESPONSE: Yes. The successful contract will need to be an actual provider or implementer of solutions. Yes. Teaming arrangements are acceptable to provide the required services.    

QUESTION #3.       Can we assume the budgets and resources for infrastructure and technology build out, staff hiring and training are part of the plan developed in the initial 45-60 days?  

RESPONSE:      Yes.      

 QUESTION #4.   Will the qualifications of individuals, as opposed to qualifications of the firm, viewed as meeting the requirements of the RFP?      

RESPONSE:  No. Past performance based primarily upon the qualifications of individuals does not meet the requirements of the RFQ.  Past performance information, may include that of a parent company(ies), members in a joint venture, teaming arrangement, limited liability company, or other similar entity and subcontractors that are submitted as part of the quotation. 

QUESTION #5.     Is EEOC agreeable to a mutual confidentiality provision? 

RESPONSE:	EEOC will ensure that proprietary/confidential information included in a vendor's quotation is protected from unauthorized disclosure.  However, it is the vendor's responsibility to ensure that all proprietary/confidential information included in the quotation is appropriately marked.       	          

QUESTION #6.    Which clauses in FAR 52.212-5 are applicable to this RFP?

RESPONSE:    The applicable clauses will be selected at the time of award of the resultant contract.

QUESTION # 7.    Does EEOC want a hard copy of Offeror's Representations and Warranties submitted with Offeror's proposal package to meet the requirements of FAR 52.212-3? Alternatively, are Offeror's Representations and Certifications on ORCA sufficient? 

RESPONSE:   Quoters may submit a completed electronic or hard copy version.   However, an electronic copy is preferred. 

QUESTION # 8.    Can an Offeror use the credentials of a parent corporation or affiliate for purposes of meeting past performance requirements? 
 
RESPONSE:    Yes.  Past performance information, may include that of a parent company(ies), members in a joint venture, teaming arrangement, limited liability company, or other similar entity and subcontractors that are submitted as part of the quotation.

QUESTION #9.   The first paragraph states that the Period of Performance is from the date of award up through six (6) months thereafter  CLIN 0004 states that it is to provide consulting services from completion of the study through deployment? not to exceed six months. Does completion of the study mean CLIN 0001-0003, and if so, is CLIN 0004 an additional six months (a total of eight months), or is the entire contract for six months? 

RESPONSE:   The total Period of Performance(POP)will not exceed  six  months from the date of award.  However, the period of performance for CLIN 0001 thru CLIN 0003 will be sixty days from award (two months), which covers the migration study. The POP for CLIN 0004 (Consulting services) shall not exceed four months, from completion of the study (CLIN 0001 thru CLIN 0003) through deployment of the in-house center in 15 locations. If additional time is needed, a modification will be issued to the contract.  

QUESTION #10.    For  CLIN  0004,  what specific activities (or deliverables) does EEOC envision the vendor providing with respect to assistance, direction, and direct daily advice with the implementation of the in-house solution?  

RESPONSE:    We believe that a vendor with call center implementation expertise should be able to provide this information to the EEOC.  However, EEOC will designate a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative to monitor contractor performance under the resultant contract.  

QUESTION #11.    The RFQ specified that the proposal should be submitted in three volumes:
 
1.	Technical capabilities (understand the requirements, corporate capabilities, and key personnel)
2.	Past Performance
3.	Price
 
What is the difference between the corporate capabilities requested in Volume 1 and past performance in Volume 2?

RESPONSE:  Volume I, Technical Capabilities.  Technical capabilities responses to the requirements of the Request for Quotation are necessary to evaluate the quoter's capability to meet the stated requirements and provide the deliverables described in the solicitation. In order that evaluation may be accomplished strictly on the merit of the material submitted, no costs shall be included in technical quotation (Volume I).
  
Volume II, Past Performance.  Past performance describes how well the quoter performed on recent relevant contracts which are similar in complexity and scope to requirements of the solicitation.   

QUESTION #12.  When does the EEOC anticipate converting to the in-house contact center?

RESPONSE:    The Vendor is required to provide recommendation(s) as part of response to the solicitation.

Offers will be accepted via e-mail to  Questions and Response  Regarding the term "clean up"-specifically what needs to be changed , edited or corrected on these 10 Digi-Beta tapes that the VA will be supplying as masters?  Take out the audience noise, breaks, lunches,  Anything that interferes with presentation materials. Do you require "closed captioning" on the finished DVD's. yes You state the length of the tapes to be 45-60 minutes ea.- do you really want the finished DVDs to be DVD-9 or DVD-5?  DVD-5 Regarding the authoring of the main menus - what exactly are you looking for..a menu button for each chapter? graphics for the menu page? The conference brochure should be attached.  Do an index page listing each of the speakers in order so viewer can click on the presentation he wishes to view. Is the printed 4"x4" insert being used instead of a printed "wrap-around" insert on the outside of the Amaray  case, or will you require a printed "wrap-around" in addition? We will provide the graphics to print on the outside cover of the set.  No insert is needed.    What shipping method will you want (UPS Ground,USPS,etc.) for the 200 sets that are shipped to individual addresses? The least expensive is ok Will you provide us with the artwork for the "on disc" printing for the 11 DVDs and 1 CD?  Yes, we have the artwork from the conference - just need to know the final size of the package so the artwork can be adjusted to fit. Solicitation states: "Services are required to build DVD/CD set which includes a) edited conference presentations (4 ? days - 45 -60 minutes for each presentation for DVD - clean up and transfer to DiGi-Beta for transfer to DVD" Questions: What format are the edited presentations in now? How many presentations do you want on each DVD? What does "4 ? days - 45-60 minutes" The conference was 4.5 days with continuous presentations.   No set amount on each DVD - whatever fits The usual viewing time is 60 minutes max - this works best.  You could break into Part A and Part B if the presentation runs over 60 minutes. Most do not. Solicitation states: "speaker presentations greater than 40 minutes for CD." See above  Question: Audio of every presentation greater than 40 mintutes - see above - use DVD or CD as appropriate for content. Solicitation states: "DVD/CD authoring/mastering 10 DVD and 1 CD master (s) with main menus and auto start menus and printed insert for DVD case." Question: You also want an insert inside the case with content information? No, the information can all be on the DVD/CD to include brochure and index page. Solicitation state: "11 disc amaray cases (10-DVDs, 1-CD)" - the final count will be based on fitting all of the material - no set no.  Question: This is not a standard case size & will require a special order. Can you get away with a 10-disc case for DVDs & 1-disc case for CD? Or a combination -- like a 5-disc & 6-disc case? A combination is ok or whatever works best for the total package.   Solicitation states: "Insertion and shrink wrapping of all DVDs, CDs, printed inserts and cases for 3 to 5 day ground shipping for 800 copies" Question: You want 800 cases & contents assembled, individually shrink-wrapped, and packed in a box?

Assure these documented man-hours do not conflict with the proposed man-hours in the technical proposal.  	(2) Rates and Factors: Provide a rate table by year for all labor and overhead rates and pricing factors.  If Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) is in existence, that should be included, along with the Administrative Contracting Officer?s (ACO's) conta ct information. 	(3) Other Direct Costs.
