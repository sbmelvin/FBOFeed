<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to Nippon Instruments North America, 1511 Texas Ave. S, #270, College Station, Texas 77840 for the purchase of a MA-3000 Mercury Analyzer instrument for solid samples.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is a 30-60 days.<br /><br />Nippon Instruments North America is the only company that sells the MA-3000 instrument that meets the technical lab requirements. The MA-3000 system has been tested by sending the manufacturer's representatives known and blind tobacco samples to determine whether the system could perform as advertised for high-organic samples such as tobacco and obtaining acceptable results without sample digestion. The ability to analyze tobacco leaves without digestion, and without interference from combustion products path is critical for high sample throughput. The system, because of its dual optical cells for both low and high range measurements with automatic range selection for unattended operation was able to calibrate across the full linear range of 0 to 2,000 ng mercury for the unknown samples without a trial analyses to determine range.
<p><br />The MA-3000 system is capable of analysis of high-organic samples such as tobacco and obtaining acceptable results without sample digestion, and using liquid calibration standards. The 100 position autosampler is necessary for a large number of samples and high throughput. The system uses three (3) independent wavelength specific phototubes for mercury detection for simultaneous low and high range measurements while avoiding cross-over problems inherent in other dual cell detector designs. The tri-cell detector permits acquisition of the high signal, low signal, and reference simultaneously in a single analysis. These capabilities are also critical for avoiding spending time on range search analyses and sample repeats.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Nippon Instruments North America. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the instrument to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 91902 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN January 22, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months with four twelve month option periods.</p>
<p>Telegenetics technology is the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve a patient's health. Electronic communication means the use of interactive telecommunications equipment that includes, at a minimum, audio and video equipment permitting two-way, real time interactive communication between the patient, and the physician or practitioner at the distant site. Telemedicine is viewed as a cost-effective alternative to the more traditional face-to-face way of providing medical care (e.g., face-to-face consultations or examinations between provider and patient) that states may choose to cover. This technology has been shown to greatly expand access to healthcare services world-wide and has been tested by a wide range of medical specialties including genetics. In addition this technology has been used predominately to monitor a patient at home or a long term care facility and lastly provide office/hospital based telemedicine which involves real time in -person encounters with the patient.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />The contractor shall possess a PhD in nursing with concentration in genetics. The individual shall have at least 10 years of experience in cancer genetics/ genomics with research related to breast and colorectal cancer screening. Other required qualifications include experience developing protocols, patient data analysis and (Institutional Review Board) IRB review experience. Contractor shall provide their own equipment and tools necessary to provide contract services.</p>
<p>The contractor shall complete the following tasks: 1) maintain MTDP consultation &amp; clinical services; 2) monitor, peer review and finalize the patient and monitor health care provider information materials and screens; 3) develop and maintain the MTDP protocol, target population, specific aims, methods, outcome measures and planned statistical analysis; regulatory review and approval of the protocol; 4) orientation, launching and recruitment for the protocol; and 5) generate receiver operating curves (ROCs).</p>
<p>BTR is uniquely qualified to provide these services for the following reasons:  BTR has the education (Ph.D) and research experience (10-20 years) relating to cancer genetics/genomics, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.  They have experience as an expert reviewer, and technical writer for an organization whose research concentration is in cancer genetics and colorectal cancer.  BTR has published numerous journal articles relating to genetics nursing, and have research experience in breast and colorectal cancer screening decision-making in individuals and families at increased risk for developing these cancers.  Based on market research, NCI knows of no other vendor that has performed said services and can meet the requirements as specified above.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

EPAct Technical Assistance

BACKGROUND

Public and private vehicle fleets continue to be the subject of broad interest as a test bed for implementing and evaluating new vehicle and fuel technologies.  Federal legislation, such as the Energy Policy Acts (EPAct) of 1992 and 2005 and relevant amendments, established a variety of requirements for certain fleets with one goal being to reduce the nations petroleum consumption. Executive Orders have placed additional requirements on Federal fleets.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) supports implementation of these requirements for State and alternative fuel provider fleets through its Vehicle Technologies Program, and for Federal fleets through its Federal Energy Management Program.  These activities are described in more detail at: 

	http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/epact; and,
	http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/program/fedfleetmanagement.html.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides technical, regulatory, and analytic support to these activities.  NRELs role is to analyze and report on fleet progress on reducing petroleum usage, analyze and propose innovations to accelerate progress, and provide tools and resources to enable fleets to meet and exceed their requirements.  NREL also assesses the impact of proposed legislation and program strategies on vehicular petroleum consumption, drafts guidance for fleets on new legislative and executive branch requirements, develops implementing regulations for programs related to these fleets, and provides technical evaluations of proposed new alternative fuels.  In addition, NREL is tasked with integrating work across several related petroleum-displacement programs, to leverage resources and ensure analytic work is synchronized with technical work in related R&D programs.

OBJECTIVE

NREL is seeking individuals or organizations that have the required expertise to provide technical, regulatory, and analytical support and assistance to NRELs EPAct activities.  These individuals or organizations will be tasked with specific projects or project elements to support NRELs annual operating plan.

Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>II. TOPIC:<BR><BR>The Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground Systems Survivability (GSS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources and the status of state-of-the-art RPG active protection technology and its capabilities against tactical and (or) combat vehicle requirements.  TARDEC is requesting a detailed breakdown of the cost, schedule, and logistics necessary to mature an Active Protection System (APS) to the provided vehicle threshold requirements.  The intent of the market survey is to gather information to assess the potential for TARDEC to obtain an RPG active protection system meeting a set of threshold requirements that will successfully complete component-level maturation testing and integration and system level testing on a vehicle demonstrator.  The data gathered in the market survey will help define and influence the trade space and requirements of a follow-on Request for Proposal (RFP) for APS maturation released through the TARDEC Omnibus.<BR><BR>Each responding contractor shall provide a brief description of the overall system to include the defeat mechanism and integration requirements needed to support the technology.  Identify the components and sub-components of the system; provide the function of each component and sub-component of the overall system and the interfaces between each component; provide the space, weight, and power required for each component and sub-component; and provide a description of testing and analysis completed to date on each component and sub-component.  Provide the individual component costs and overall system cost for three scenarios: 1) prototype cost for system as-is, 2) estimated prototype cost for system meeting threshold requirements, 3) production cost for system meeting threshold requirements assuming 1000 units.<BR><BR>Provide a detailed status report of the system compared to the requirements provided in Attachment A.  Each requirement should be addressed in the response.  If your system meets a requirement without additional optimization, provide data to support the claim through system specifications, models or previous test results.  For instances where the current system does not meet the threshold requirement, provide a technology maturation plan needed to mature the system to meet it.

Participation in this market survey is completely voluntary.  If the Government seeks additional information that is not included in a submittal, TARDEC representatives may contact the participant for further information exchange.  Vendor teaming is permitted, but not required.  Information developed as part of this market survey may be shared with US Army Research, Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands; Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems Program Offices; Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS) Program Offices; and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) (i.e. Office of Naval Research, Marine Corps, etc.).<BR><BR>IV. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION:<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PROTECT UNMARKED DATA. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR><BR>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available<BR>

<DESC>SMC&nbsp;A-AS Industry Day &amp; CABS Market Survey/Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>Background. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA has developed a follow-on acquisition to replace the SMC Financial Support (SFS) and SMC Acquisition Support (SAS) programs for Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS). The SFS program provides financial, cost management, schedule management, and related training A&amp;AS support to SMC organizations. The SAS program provides manpower, personnel, administration, configuration/data management, acquisition planning, contracting and associated training support. Both programs were awarded task orders under FAR 8 Fair Opportunity business rules via SMC Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) based upon GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES), Schedule 871, contracts. This work was set-aside for small business BPA holders with less than 1,000 employees consistent with NAICS code 541710 (circa 2002). Both programs are expected to complete either by late calendar year 2011 or within 2012 based on Government transition planning. SMC held an A&amp;AS Industry Day in Jan 2010 followed by a SAFS SDB survey closing 4 Aug 2010 to form the basis for the acquisition strategy. As the acquisition plan was under formation, the program name formally changed from the temporary moniker of "SPS" to SMC Acquisition and Financial Services (SAFS). SMC objectives under the SAFS strategy are to increase competition, make opportunities available to the SDVOSB community, and encourage the development of long-term space support capabilities.</p>
<p>C2C. Coupled to this acquisition, it is anticipated that SMC Contractor to Civilian Conversion (C2C) activities will directly impact effort on this program. The goal of C2C is to convert contracted A&amp;AS support to Government civilian staffing. The SMC C2C plan is currently in progress but will take several years to complete.</p>
<p>Status. Based on Government decisions made 10 Dec 2010, SMC is seeking sources for two follow-on acquisitions. Under FAR Part 15, the Government intends to compete "Financial and Acquisition Business Support" (FABS) and "Contractor Administrative Business Support" (CABS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that provision Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) A&amp;AS effort. Contract scope will derive from the former SFS and SAS programs but will be tempered by C2C, organizational conflict of interest principles, and decisions based on "near" and inherently governmental functions. At the task order competitions, SMC intends to leverage FFP to the maximum extent. Relevant charts directly from the Government decision brief and draft Performance Work Statements for each program are provided.</p>
<p>Set Asides. A target of four (4) FABS contracts are reserved for Small Businesses under NAICS code 541712 (circa 2007) that carries a 1,000 employee size standard. A target of six (6) CABS contracts are exclusively reserved for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) under NAICS code 541611 [$7M size standard].</p>
<p>Schedule. FABS is expected to be solicited 1st quarter of calendar year 2011 and ready for the commencement of work by July 2011. CABS is estimated to follow with a 2nd quarter solicitation and ready for the commencement of work by October 2011.</p>
<p>CABS Survey. For CABS, the Government has provided a market survey. For interested CABS primes &amp; team members, please complete/return a survey via email to the Program Manager (<a href="mailto:timothy.greer@losangeles.af.mil">timothy.greer@losangeles.af.mil</a>) and Contracting Officer (<a href="mailto:roberto.acosta@losangeles.af.mil">roberto.acosta@losangeles.af.mil</a>) NLT 4:00 PM PST, 14 January 2010.</p>
<p>Industry Day. An SMC A-AS Industry Day is scheduled 20 January 2010, 2:00pm PST, at the Gordon Conference Center, Room 1, 483 N Aviation Blvd, Building 270 (1st Floor), Los Angeles AFB CA 90245-2808. Due to limited accommodations, interested primes are requested to limit company participation to 2 members maximum. Current and potential team members are requested to limit company participation to 1 member. Be advised that visitor parking is limited. Each attendee must register NLT 4:00 PM PST, 14 January 2010 at the following website:</p>
<p><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCAASIndustryDay2011/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/SMCAASIndustryDay2011/anim.cfm</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Under FABS and CABS, SMC is investigating the use of volume oriented discount pricing and/or rebates at the IDIQ level based on total dollars implemented/executed (i.e. cumulative task order effort performed or in progress, not including future unexercised options). The Government is interested in any ideas and/or commercial best practices. If interested parties have feedback on this and other particulars, such as the draft Performance Work Statements, the Government encourages industry dialog/input. For any recommended solutions, contractors are welcomed to turn in a brief description of the mechanics (framework, basis, trigger points, processes, etc.) at the end of the forum. Please send your feedback to the Program Manager at <a href="mailto:timothy.greer@losangeles.af.mil">timothy.greer@losangeles.af.mil</a> and to the Contracting officer at <a href="mailto:roberto.acosta@losangeles.af.mil">roberto.acosta@losangeles.af.mil</a>.</p>

The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, 8(a), HubZone and other Small Businesses interested and capable of providing the services described below.  Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Responses to this notice shall include the following: (a) company name  (b) address (c) point of contact (d) phone, fax, and email (e) DUNS number (f) Cage Code  (g) Tax ID Number (h) Type of small business, e.g. Services Disabled Veteran Owned  small Business, Veteran-owned small business, 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small  Business, Small disadvantaged business, or Small Business HUBZone business and (i) must  provide a capability statement that addresses the organizations qualifications and ability to perform as a contractor for the work described below.

The VA Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) has a requirement to subscribe a web-based (computerized) WHO Drug and Herbal Dictionaries to code concomitant medications (two or more drugs used or given at or almost at the same time, on the same day) being taken by clinical trial subjects.  

The WHO Drug Dictionary provides a standard for describing drugs and herbal medications.  It provides a hierarchy of terms which can be used to describe a subject's medication at various levels of detail.  It should be widely accepted as the standard in drug naming and categorization.  It is available in electronic format and can be used in conjunction with third-party software, designed for coding non-standard drug descriptions in batch (i.e. dsNavigator).  

An important reason for coding clinical data is to be able to optimize the analysis of the medicinal products being taken by clinical trial subjects.  In order to understand the positive and negative effects of medicinal products one must consider all concomitant medicines they are using, not only a particular product under study or evaluation.

The text in a case report - the verbatim - includes information about the drugs taken by the clinical trial subject.  This information can be of various types - a trade name, a substance or a very imprecise name of a group of products.

The WHO Drug Dictionaries are used to find the names mentioned in the verbatim and translate them to a code, which is entered into the clinical data set.  Sometimes other pieces of information are important in order to identify the correct entry in the dictionary - country, pharmaceutical form, etc.  The Drug Dictionaries are formatted to let you analyze the coded data.  The analysis can help regulators identify substances that may interact with products under investigation, and to make the best decisions based on the full understanding of the drugs and how they are used.

When the code is entered into the clinical data set it makes it possible to retrieve all information about the drug when assessing and analyzing the data.  It also makes it possible to produce reports - regulatory report or internal.

The WHO Drug Dictionaries should consist of medicinal product names - both proprietary and non-proprietary - from more than 90 countries.  The dictionaries contain information about prescription-only, over-the-counter and pharmacist-dispensed products.  Vaccines, blood products, diagnostic substances and contrast media are also included.

All drugs in the WHO Drug Dictionary Enhanced are classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification - ATC.  Through this hierarchical way of grouping medicinal products it is possible to analyze the data according to therapeutic usage, to pharmacological sites of action and to aspects of chemical structure; or some combination of those.

The WHO Drug Dictionaries and their built-in hierarchies are developed to solve drug safety/ pharmacovigilance problems, coding analysis, regulatory reporting and to classify drugs recorded in adverse drug reaction case reports.

Important information: The Government is not obligated to nor will it pay for or reimburse any costs associated with responding to this sources sought synopsis request. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The Government will in no way be bound to this information if any solicitation is issued.  If response by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms proves inadequate, an alternate set-aside or full and open competition may be determined.  No sub-contracting opportunity is anticipated. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712 500 employees.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

Brooming, rolling, and supplemental spreading of aggregate shall continue until the surface is cured and rolled sufficiently to key and set the aggregate.

Upgrading these installations to Microsoft SharePoint 2010, as well as the implementation and maintenance of future versions of web collaboration technology, is a major component of this acquisition.

<DESC><br />Background
<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>
<p>The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for the operation and management IT infrastructure that supports patient care and research. The infrastructure includes networking equipment, servers, Storage Area Networks (SANS), Virtual Tape Library, desktops, laptops, workstations on wheels (WOW), Sunray terminals, Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) applications, custom applications, and other supporting technology systems. The (COTS) both Clinical and administrative as well as custom applications are hosted on a variety of Windows and UNIX based server technologies located in the Clinical Center Data Center (CCDC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p><br />This request is for the purchase of item below for the CCDC.</p>
<p><br />Scope</p>
<p>The vendor will provide a proposal for items listed below</p>

<p>Section 508</p>
<p>Section 508 applies to this requirement. All Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) procured through this procurement must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists. 36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm Part 1194. Contractors are now responsible for indicating on each line item in the procurement whether products or services are compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194</p>
<p>Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act ("Section 508") was enacted to eliminate barriers that might interfere with the ability of individuals with disabilities to fully access Web-delivered information and fully utilize Web-based tools and services. Section 508 requirements apply to Web sites, including all forms of information and posted content, as well as any associated applications including Web or media. <br />This interim acquisition policy provides language applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use - to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. The project officer (also known as the contracting officer's technical representative) must ensure that communications products produced or delivered by contractors or consultants meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards and are suitable for posting to an HHS Web site. <br />Discussion and Analysis <br />This policy applies to: <br />1. HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions (OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs) and to their contractors and consultants that produce new reports, brochures, and other text or graphical communications products, or produce new multimedia products, such as videotapes and Webcasts, or provide computer based training materials or products. <br />2. HHS OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs and to their contractors and consultants that provide new Web-based product support documentation to end-users.</p>
<p>This interim acquisition guidance does not apply to those systems covered by the specific Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) guidance (dated January 16, 2008) for the acquisition of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) (including Web-based applications, software packages deployed through the Web and script-based interactive sites). <br />This interim acquisition guidance is effective upon issuance for all new acquisitions. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 2 <br />Responsibilities <br />The Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT) shall: <br />Provide policy and procedural support with respect to establishing, implementing, operating and maintaining Web sites or producing communication products and services. <br />The Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) shall: <br />Propose Section 508-compliant performance standards, provide guidance for their implementation, and ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. Guidance and training is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html#508. <br />Develop training and technical assistance materials to support OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in the use of this guidance. <br />Appoint a representative to the HHS Section 508 Program Team to ensure alignment with ongoing Departmental Section 508 activities. <br />The Director of the Office on Disabilities (OD) shall: <br />Approve and interpret Section 508-compliant performance standards. <br />Disseminate updated guidance and policy interpretations through http://508.hhs.gov/. <br />Provide technical support to OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in determining the application of Section 508. <br />Share best practices through the Section 508 Program Team. <br />Review lessons learned and coordinate with ASPA necessary updates to Section 508 guidance. <br />The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy (DASAMP) shall: <br />Ensure the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) is modified to incorporate the interim Section 508 guidance provided in this document and ensure that it enhances and supports existing Section 508 guidance. <br />OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs shall: <br />Ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. <br />Ensure that the staff receives training and technical assistance regarding Section 508.US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 3 <br />Interim Acquisition Guidance <br />For new actions, while developing or amending a SOW or PWS in accordance with HHSAR 307.7106 (renumbered HHSAR 307.7108) and FAR 37.602, project officers must address communications products and services in the HHS Acquisition Plan. In addition to the acquisition planning requirements under HHSAR Part 307, project officers must address Section 508 compliance requirements for documents generated for and by HHS that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />For those acquisitions of communications products and services not requiring an Acquisition Plan, the Project Officer must include all documentation pursuant to HHSAR 307.7101(c). The assigned project officer (contracting officer's technical representative) will ensure communication products are provided to the end-users in a Section 508- compliant format. <br />The project officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final (36 CFR Part 1194) in the SOW/PWS - e.g., "36 CFR 1194(a)-(j)". Most Web-based text and communication will need to meet 36 CFR Part 1194.22, "Web-Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications". Additionally, 36 CFR Part 1194.41, "Information, Documentation and Support," and 36 CFR Part 1194.24 "Video and Multimedia Products" are of particular importance with regard to all written, graphical or broadcast, video materials or products produced for HHS (to include training). 36 CFR Part 1194.41 outlines the requirements supporting services for products accommodating the communication needs of end-users with disabilities. Contact your OPDIV/STAFFDIV Section 508 Coordinator for additional assistance in determining the applicable provisions. <br />The Project Officer (the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative), in consultation with ASPA/Web Communications Division, will make a Section 508-compliance determination prior to posting to a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />The project officer shall include the attached "Section C.A. Section 508" language in Statements of Work (SOWs) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for communication products and services that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 4 <br />C.A. Section 508 <br />This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). <br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. <br />1 Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 5 <br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS: <br />[Project Officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194) - e.g., "36 CFR 1194.21(a)-(j)"] <br />References: <br />HHS Policy for Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) (January 2005): http://www.hhs.gov/od/Final_Section_508_Policy.html <br />HHS Section 508 Web site: http://508.hhs.gov/ <br />HHS ASPA Web Communications Division Web site: <br />http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html <br />US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm<br />Period of Performance</p>

<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) requires maintenance of Electron Microscopes.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information:<br /></strong>Since its inception, the Laboratory of Structural Biology Research (LSBR) has specialized in detailed structural analysis of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and subcellular structures by computer-enhanced electron microscopy. The goal of these studies is to elucidate structure-function relationships at the molecular level with particular emphasis on (but not restricted to) systems that bear directly on the mission of NIAMS. This program was initiated in 1978 with the appointment of a tenure-track investigator (the Project Officer), and progressed to become a Section in 1984, and further to Laboratory status in 1990. A typical research project involves recording electron micrographs of the highest possible quality, subjecting them to digital image analysis to elicit the maximum amount of structural information, and interpretation, taking into account all pertinent complementary data. Over the years, the LSBR has performed ground-breaking studies on cytoskeletal filaments, virus particles and antigens, and complex enzymes among other important biomedical specimens. Cryo-electron microscopy - the technique of visualizing organic specimens suspended in vitreous ice - was introduced in the 1980s and has revolutionized what is achievable. The LSBR has been to the fore in these advances and in 1997 accomplished the landmark result of extending the resolution on isolated complexes below the 10&Aring; limit for the first time. The results achieved depend both on the quality of the primary data (electron microscope images) and the scope of computer analysis. As for the former, keeping our electron microscopes operational and maintaining them in peak performing condition are essential to our work.<br /><br /><strong>Objectives<br /></strong>Specifically, in order to keep the LSBR's electron microscopes operational and maintain them in peak performing condition, a maintenance contract that covers repair and routine maintenance is required.</p>
<p><strong>Microscopes include:<br /></strong>Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)<br />CM200 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)<br />Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)<br />Tecnai F30 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)</p>

<p><strong>Independent Contractor <br /></strong>The contractor shall be considered an independent contractor and not an agent of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Confidential Information <br /></strong>The contractor shall not disclose information the Government has deemed confidential.</p>
<p><strong>The Contractor MUST Have the Following:<br /></strong>A. The chosen contractor's service engineers must be factory trained by the equipment manufacturer on how to maintain and repair the electron microscopes and have the necessary knowledge to service all aspects of these instruments, including hardware, software and proprietary components.</p>
<p>B. The chosen contractor must have access to all instrument operation and repair information, including manuals, schematics and technical bulletins.</p>
<p>C. The chosen contractor must have access to all replacement parts, including proprietary components.</p>
<p>D. The chosen contractor's service engineers must be extremely familiar with the operation of the electron microscopes as well as familiar with equipment and software from third party electron microscopy component vendors which are embedded in or connected to the electron microscopes. This would include such items as CCD cameras, energy filters, and image acquisition and processing software such as DigitalMicrograph.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Factors for Award<br /></strong>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and establish one contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the public interest; accept an other than the lowest cost/priced proposal; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</p>
<p>Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, and past performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance and cost/price are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price. The government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Evaluation Criteria<br /></strong>1. The chosen contractor must have an understanding of techniques used in the lab such as cryo-microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. (33 points)</p>
<p>2. The chosen contractor must have years of experience maintaining and repairing electron microscopes manufactured by FEI (and Philips Electron Optics). (34 points)<br />3. The chosen contractor must be able to produce on request references from long term and satisfied customers whose laboratories undertake demanding and cutting edge electron microscopy research similar to the work of the LSBR. (33 points)</p>
<p><strong>Cost Considerations<br /></strong>Cost/price is a selection factor. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price, but not to the exclusion of consideration of cost or price. The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance<br /></strong>Past performance is not included in the technical evaluation criteria; however, it will be evaluated to determine the contractor's responsibility.<br />FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008); FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (AUG 2009); FAR 212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (JUN 2010); FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUL 2010) is included with the following additional clauses: FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT2003); and FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (APR2008).</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This announcement serves as both a notice to offerors and as the solicitation. Responses (Quotes) should be developed based upon this announcement since a formal solicitation (Request for Quotations) will not be issued. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. The NAICS Code is 511210. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with OpenText, Inc., 275 Frank Tompa Drive, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L-OA1, for a renewal of its Hummingbird BIQuery software license and support for an 11-month Base Period of 02-01-11 through 12-31-11 with two successive 12-month Option Periods. The Hummingbird BIQuery enterprise content management (ECM) software was initially acquired by NIH in 1995 as the primary reporting tool for the NIH Data Warehouse, an enterprise-wide system that brings all of NIH's administrative data and reporting requirements together in one place. The NIH Data Warehouse was initially developed as a data repository using the DB2 database system on an IBM main-frame. By 1995, managers were able to use a Windows-based graphical user interface to query the data repository in such subject areas as budget and finance, personnel, procurement, property, travel, and research grants. In 1996, due to the increasing popularity of the data repository and the requirement to increase its functionality to support NIH's heterogeneous legacy systems, NIH migrated the data in the data repository into an enterprise-wide data warehouse. The data warehouse provides management with timely, accurate business intelligence on NIH's funding, suppliers, inventories, research activities and facilities, and other areas important to NIH and its constituents. The data warehouse transforms data from disparate sources into cohesive, consistent information and provides desktop access to this information. It is optimized for answering both current and historical business questions with easy extraction of data from the central data warehouse for report generation, exportation into data marts, or downloading into desktop spreadsheets. NIH managers can run predefined queries and reports and can develop ad hoc queries and reports on administrative and scientific functions. The functions in the NIH Data Warehouse are currently grouped into the following business areas: Budget and Finance, Department of Health and Human Services Contract Information System (DCIS) Reporting, Government Purchase Card, Human Resources, Procurements and Market Requisitions, Property (Historical), Research Contracts and Grants, Staff Training, and NIH Executive Reporting. The legacy NIH Data Warehouse enterprise system is currently undergoing a migration to the latest "best practice" technologies under the new NIH nVision Data Warehouse, including the legacy reporting tool. NIH will gradually migrate the legacy business areas, including the critical Budget and Finance components, in the legacy Data Warehouse until such time that the NIH New Business System (NBS) and the new NIH nVision Data Warehouse can reach a state of stabilization. Hummingbird BIQuery is the only ECM software available in the marketplace that can successfully fulfill NIH's requirement for a reporting tool application during the migration. CIT has therefore determined that it would be impossible to convert to a new software reporting tool at this point during the migration process. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software product and support specifications which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the NIH Data Warehouse ECM reporting tool requirements. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror's Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within five (5) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-11-053-DAH shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: hurgeda@mail.nih.gov .

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  

The range shall be within a 30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.  The 30 minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.  The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled.    The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25- and 15-yard line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example:  wood).  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use. The range shall be equipped with men and women restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide adequate parking to accommodate 15 vehicles and coincide with the location of cited above (30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport).  The range must possess an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board to accommodate 10 (ten) students.   The range must be able to accommodate the following calibers: 9mm, .40, and .357 (may be frangible) caliber ammunition.  The range rules must allow movement between firing points and will not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules will allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).   Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.

DHS personnel will use the range an average of 8 days per month with usage of 6 hours per day (equating to 48 hours per month). The estimated number of rounds fired is 80,000 per year.    The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in four hour blocks from 0800 to 1800 hours, and blocks in the evening for night/low shooting.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there are may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of the weekend may be needed.  Should weather (i.e, rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS wil have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.

The proposed contract will be for a base year and four one year options. Services anticipated on or before March 1, 2011.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:<BR><BR>(1) Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.  <BR><BR>(2)  Unacceptable - A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk  and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROT</strong>ESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;</p>
<p>(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;</p>

This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report, Form MLCA(v)005-1. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the contractor, MLC(vr), the NESU and Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will make the final response to the contractor in writing.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.</p>
<p>Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<p><br />PART 3 - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT <br />3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES <br />The Division performs laboratory research related to drug safety. An important aspect of this research is to determine drug induced injury on the tissue and cellular levels. This information and information about mechanisms of injury can be obtained by analyzing histopathology changes from tissue derived from in vivo animal toxicology studies. Tissue samples from animal toxicology studies are embedded and sectioned onto glass slides. The Aperio equipment allows glass slides to scanned into digital images that can then be stored, shared, and analyzed with accompanying image analysis software. Presently, this equipment is used to support multiple projects within CDER as well as collaborative studies with other FDA Centers. The Division requires these capabilities to fulfill current study protocols and evolving experimental aims.</p>
<p>Preventative maintenance and a service contract are required to keep this equipment functioning properly and have timely repairs as needed. If the instrument is out of service, there is no readily available replacement instrument to complete this work. A service contract is justified for this instrument due to the high replacement cost of this instrument ($250,000.00).

<DESC>Change the Response Date to read: 12 January 2011.<br /><br />Questions and Answers:<br /><br />1. Is there a predetermined number of classes that is expected for this contract? <br /><br />Answer: Yes. The number of classes that are required for this contract are stated in CLIN 0001, 0002, 0003 &amp; 0004.
<p>2. Are there predetermined dates and times for the classes? If not, how will these be determined - do we have any input into the dates/times?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. We are requesting classes start January 2011 and end June 2011.</p>
<p>3. How long will each class last?</p>
<p>Answer: That will be determined by the institution.</p>
<p>4. CLIN 0003 and 0004 appear to be the same course since they have the same title. Is this correct? Is it correct that both of these are non-credit classes but that one (CLIN 0003) requires 2 instructors while CLIN 0004 only requires 1 instructor?</p>
<p>Answer: This is correct. A predetermined number of students will require additional instruction.</p>
<p>5. What are the responsibilities of the supplemental instructor for CLIN 0003? It is unusual to have 2 instructors for the same class, so this is unclear.</p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp;The responsibility of the supplemental instructor for CLIN 0003 will be to provide additional instruction to a&nbsp;predetermined&nbsp;number of students.</p>
<p>6. Each CLIN shows a number of students per class. Is this number firm, the minimum number or the maximum number of students per class? If this is not either firm or the maximum, what is the maximum number of students per class?</p>
<p>Answer: The number of students per class is firm according to each CLIN.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROT</strong>ESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this second&nbsp;Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is to determine whether the LISC could be set aside for small business under NAICS Code 541330 - Engineering Services. The previous SSS was done under NAICS Code 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; but, since the release of that SSS, the NAICS Code has been changed to 541330. Small businesses intending to respond to this SSS are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would be included in a contract set aside for small business. This clause states at FAR 52.219-14(a)(1), "Services (except construction) - At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." Small businesses that responded to the previous SSS are requested to notify the Government if their small business status has changed as a result of the change of the NAICS Code.
<p>Those potential offerors that responded to the previous SSS that was released on 28 July 2009 need not respond. However, any potential offerors may revise any previous Statement of Capability. This SSS will not be used to develop a bidder's list.</p>
<p>Potential offerors, in particular small businesses, must notify David Sharp by 18 January 2011, 4:00 P.M. PST, if they intend to respond to this SSS with a Statement of Capability (SOC); completed SOCs are due by 24 January 2011, 4:00 P.M. PST.<br /><br />Please see the attachment for details and contact David Sharp at (310) 653-1517 or <a href="mailto:david.sharp@losangeles.af.mil">david.sharp@losangeles.af.mil</a> with any questions.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Communication Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. Contracting Office Address: 709 W. 9th Street, Rm 501D - AQM Juneau, AK 99801Point of Contact(s): Deb Strickland, 907-586-7902, dstrickland@fs.fed.us, 709 W. 9th St., Rm 501D-AQM, Juneau, AK 99801;Teri Sabin, 715-479-2724, tasabin@fs.fed.us, 560 Loon Lake Road, Eagle River, Wisconsin, 54521

<DESC>ADMINISTRATIVE:The last maintenance cycle created Amendment #1 with changes to the editable text of C03, D06 (specifically D.6.2), and Exhibit H.  This amendment adds the original language back in for these sections.  See Amendment #1 for a complete list of the changes from the maintenance cycle.GIS RESOURCE CATEGORY FORM and OPTIONAL INTERNET RATE:The form does not include a rate for internet.  If you intend to offer a price for this optional item, you are required to submit an attachment (a price sheet). The attachment shall be added to the offer when you attach your vendor company information form and completed resource category forms.  Include vendor name, solicitation number, and price for internet on the price sheet attachment. Do not include any personally identifiable information (PII).  Attachments with PII will be requested in negotiations to remove the PII.  As part of the evaluation process I will be validating with offerors that have attached a price sheet for internet that what they are offering meets the requirements.  If your offer is accepted, you will receive an award, the agreement will immediately be issued a modification that includes the awarded price for the optional internet.  For more information on PII, reference the following document:  OMB Memo 06-19 which can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/2006.htmlTHIS SOLICITATION HAS RECEIVED A PROTEST TO THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS:This is to notify you that a protest has been filed with the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) in connection with Solicitation number AG-024B-S-11-7001 for GIS Units.  The Case number for this protest is 10-869C.  You may obtain a redacted copy of the complaint from the COFC and file a Motion to Intervene directly with the COFC.  The Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims are available at http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/court_info/rules_20100111_v8.pdf.  The Forest Service will establish Blanket Purchase Agreements in connection with this solicitation upon the resolution of the protest.  The COFC is currently scheduled to issue a decision on March 21, 2011.  I, therefore, request that you submit your offers per the terms of the solicitation, including any amendments, by February 7, 2011 with an acceptance period through August 5, 2011 (see Section E., clause E.1).  The Forest Service will proceed with the evaluation of the offers while the protest is pending.  Any changes to this notice will be communicated directly to you at a later time, by me.If you have any questions, please contact me, slavalley@fs.fed.us or 406-329-3680, or Teri Sabin at tasabin@fs.fed.us or 715-479-2724.QUESTION/CLARIFICATION ON GISS QUALIFICATIONS:As stated in D.3.1 - if you offer a price for the GISS position, and if that position is ordered with the unit, all GIS Specialists shall meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The requirements are very similar to what was there in the previous solicitation, except we are requiring a fully qualified GISS position if ordered.All task books for vendors/contractors are to be initiated by the employer or a qualified training provider.  Most Geographic Areas have a Forest Service or agency person that works with vendors and/or contractors on training-related issues.  I would suggest you discuss local practices with that person on the initiation of a task book if you intend on offering a price for the GISS position.  There are several items in the task book that can be completed in a classroom or simulation, there are also several that have to be completed on an incident managed under the Incident Command System, and several that have to be completed on a wildfire incident.  Please refer to the task book for more information.  Here is a link to the task book at the NWCG:   http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/taskbook/planning/pms-311-77.pdfSPECIFICATIONSD.2.1.1, number 11 and 12  disregard any dimension requirements for awning and windows.

<p>Smithsonian institution is issuing&nbsp;a request for proposal for a Construction Management at Risk Contract (CMc) for the construction of the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE (NMAAHC). The proposed contract listed here is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Smithsonian. The new NMAAHC museum will be constructed on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The site is approximately five acres in area and bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements to be used for outdoor museum programs in a manner consistent with its context and contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall. The facility program calls for a new museum building of approximately 330,000 gross square feet which will be a place of collaboration with museums and other organizations to promote the study and appreciation of African American life and its impact on the nation and the world. The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220 and the size standard under this code is $33.5 million average annual receipts over the last three years. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. If the selected firm is a large business, a subcontracting plan consistent with PL 95-507, PL 99-661 and PL 100-656 will be required with the proposal. A minimum goal of 40% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 20% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with Small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions; 10% with Women-owned small businesses (WOSB); 10% shall be placed with Hub-zone Small Businesses (HubZone), 5% with Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB); and 5% with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDV). The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection. An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. You no longer have to submit representations and certifications with your proposal.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Chemical-Demilitarization Directorate intends to award a performance-based contract to assist the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Minpromtorg) of the Russian Federation (RF) by providing continued technical assistance in the systemization, operations, and maintenance (O&M) of the Shchuch'ye Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility (Shchuch'ye CWDF).. This continuation of support effort at the Shchuch'ye CWDF is funded through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under an agreement dated June 17, 1992, between the United States and Russia Federation for the Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage and Destruction of Weapons and Prevention of Weapons Proliferation (Umbrella Agreement). The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a full-time on-site staff to provide technical assistance during the systemization and operational phases of the facility in an effort to maintain full operation capability. The effort will include assistance with systemization of installed equipment, technical support services, limited procurement of equipment and spare parts and installation services, verification of work performed at the site, and logistics and administrative support for U.S. program management personnel.<BR><BR>As an option, the Government may award a separate task order at a later date to be deteremined for the same or similar type support to an additional CWDF located in Kizner, Russia. The Kizner CWDF facility will present the same or similar requirement as the Shchuch'ye facility in the number and type of munitions to be destroyed. It is anticipated that the destruction of approximately two million chemical weapons at the Kizner CWDF will begin during 2011.  <BR><BR>This acquisition is for continued U.S. technical assistance to the Russian Federation in support of efforts to destroy chemical munitions. The original objective of the Chemical Weapons Elimination program was to assist the Russian Federation (RF) in establishing a chemical weapons destruction facility (CWDF) near Shchuch'ye, Russia for the purpose of destroying chemical filled munitions in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner. Shchuch'ye was the specific location named by the Russian Federation when they requested assistance from the United States in the establishment of a chemical agent destruction facility and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Policy guidance supported the request. The assistance provided included integrating and systemizing the processing and associated support equipment and facilities, and commissioning of the facilities as an acceptable industrial complex under RF standards and laws. As construction of the complex neared completion in 2009, the Russian Federation requested continued U.S. technical assistance to monitor and evaluate facilities and equipment maintenance through the remaining agent elimination efforts as a means of assuring continued full functionality of the systems and equipment. These services are classified under North American Industry Classification System NAICS code 541990, "All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services", with a small business size standard of $7 M. The expected contract capacity will be $48.8 Million. The Government will issue the RFP on/about 13 January 2011 for full and open competition.

<AWDNBR>FA4814-11-C-5000
<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase agreement to Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems Corporation. The vendor shall provide theater planning support element contract support oto Headquarters United States Central Command (CENTCOM) using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The complex strategic and tactical planning nature of this requirement requires the contractor to have substantial corporate knowledge and contractor personnel to be intimately familiar with the specific project on which they are working. Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems has served as the prime contractor for this requirement since 2008. It isn't practical to change contractors immediately for only a few months performance and expect the new contractor to maintain the same level of performance and mission support previously provided. To award a short term bridge contract to a new contractor would leave the government vulnerable to various problems due to loss of corporate knowledge and experience and ultimately would risk mission disruption. Due to the criticality of this requirement, , any disruption in contractor support would be gravely detrimental to current TPSE strategic efforts and milestone completion, possibly affecting current operations in Afghanistan. <br />The Government intends to award a one-time purchase agreement to vendor specified above. The North American Industry Classification System is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services and the size standard is 7 million. "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to a previous notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The 6th Contracting Squadron will post this notice until 1:00 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 17 January 2011 and intends to award purchase agreement after expiration of this notice. Note: No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<DESC><br />Pursuant to FAR Part 13.106-1, U.S. Department of Education, Office of Federal Student <br />issued a fixed-priced award to Cogito NA located at 139 Billerica Rd. Chelmsford MA 01854-3663, for the license and maintenance support for a proprietary software product -EZ-Reorg/RTSU.
<p>Total contract value is $62,652.00.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation exists for this requirement.</p>
<p>A determination by the government will entertain any statement of capability that may be submitted from other sources. Responses may be sent to Dega Hussen at dega.hussen@ed.gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>US Department of Education, Federal Student Aid (FSA).</p>
<p>2. Description of Action:</p>
<p>This brand name justification approves the acquisition of software maintenance renewal for EZ-Reorg/RTSU software, which is currently operating on Federal Student Aid's (Debt Management Database (DCMS) and supporting systems.</p>
<p>3. Authority:</p>
<p>This justification is authorized by FAR subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>4. Description of Supplies/Services:</p>
<p>The EZ-Reorg/RSTU software allows for the resizing of Federal Student Aid's DCMS to be performed on an offline copy of the database. After the resize is complete the product performs a "catch-up" using the before and after images of the updated production records on the Federal Student Aid database journals. The product allows the resize process to take place offline, while minimizing the down time.</p>
<p>Maintenance is required to provide critical updates, version control and support on the server listed below.</p>
<p>Host Name OS Processor MIPS Memory<br />DMCS zOS IBM 2086-320 131 8 GB</p>
<p>The government anticipates a Firm-fixed price (FFP) award to Cogito NA for a base period in the amount of $20,884.00, and (2) option periods in the amount of $20,884.00 annually.</p>
<p>The total cost for the 3 year contract is $62,652.00.<br /><br />5. Fair &amp; Reasonable Determination</p>
<p>Cogito NA solely provides EZ-Reorg/RTSU software maintenance support, thus limiting competition for brand name requirements. The proposed price for this year maintenance renewal was escalated 5 percent by the company. Accordingly, the pricing is determined to be fair and reasonable, based on historical pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />6. Market Research Conducted:</p>
<p>Cogito NA is the sole distributor of the EZ-Reorg software and there are no resellers. Therefore, solicitation will be issued directly to this firm.</p>
<p>7. Efforts to Obtain Competition: <br /><br />In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(a)(2)(b), the Contracting Officer determined that due to the exclusive licensing agreements of the subject software, that Cogito NA is the only reasonably available source.</p>
<p>Accordingly, an award will be issued directly to this firm and a redacted copy of this justification will be posted on FedBizOpps. Consideration will be give to all responses received.</p>

1.	REQUIRING ACTIVITY: VAMC BHS Jamaica Plain, Boston, MA (MAVERIC/Research 151) 150 South Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02130 

2.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 241/ VISN 1 Contracting 90C- VAMC Providence, RI 

3.	PROPOSED ACTION: Sole-source contract to Tecan U.S., P.O. Box 13953 Research Triangle Park, NC 27709

4.	DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  Acquisition of an automated liquid handling robot intended for high throughput normalization of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) samples. 

5.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: Reference 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

6.	PROPOSED CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:  

Research and Development is integral to the activities of the VA, as medical research is one of its three fundamental missions. VA Boston Healthcare has one of the largest and most active research programs in the VA nationwide. The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) Core Laboratory processes and stores specimens for clinical trials run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The laboratory is getting ready for a large scale genomics project that will require processing of 500 samples a day in addition to existing and ongoing processing for other Cooperative Studies Program projects. This normalization unit is necessary to guarantee analysis laboratories and study stake-holders acceptable DNA concentrations and to facilitate the processing of such a large volume of samples.

Tecan is an industry and global leader in laboratory instrumentation and solutions for a wide range of users, most notably diagnostic and clinical laboratories. Tecan is well known for specializing in the development, production, and distribution of systems and automated solutions for laboratories in this sector. Government laboratories are one of the three main markets Tecan serves. What makes Tecan unique in this specific case is the scalability and adaptability of their liquid handling normalization application. The EVO system is designed such that additional equipment modules, components, instruments, etc. can be easily added on and integrated after the machine has been purchased. Examples of add-ons include quantification/concentration instrumentation and additional robotic arms. This unique qualification is ideal given the upcoming genomic medicine study for MAVERIC Core Lab, as the Lab will ultimately need to scale up operations and functionality.


7.	DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONDUCT ANY MARKET RESEARCH TO LOCATE SOURCES:  

At least three companies were identified as potential vendors for this case; Tecan, XXXXX , and YYYYY . All three companies were contacted for quotes for an automated liquid handling normalization system as noted above. Quotes detailing system design and communications with company representatives served as the basis for evaluating technical and operational capabilities. Tecan was identified as the best value potential vendor and system because of the scalability and adaptability dimension as noted above.
8.	DETERMINATION OF PRICE REASONABLENESS:   The Contracting Officer's determination will be based upon the commercial price and a comparison with other systems.
 
9.	ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SUPPORT OF SUBMISSION:  

In addition to Tecan's unique qualifying characteristics listed above and the large scale nature of the projects MAVERIC Core Lab is facing, it is important to note specifically why the other units were not identified as ideal or preferred systems. Both alternate units did not possess the scalability or adaptability that Tecan offers with the EVO system. The XXXXX system has some of the similar capabilities as the Tecan system, although the scalability factor is not of the same standard. For example, the Tecan system can integrate a centrifuge into the deck after the machine has been purchased and put into use. The XXXXX system does not allow for this integration after it has been put into production; the centrifuge has to be integrated during the machines original development. Additionally, the MAVERIC Core Lab has already purchased liquid handling applications from XXXXX for DNA extraction and there is some genuine concern behind these systems. Since being purchased these applications have not reached acceptable quality production levels and we are hesitant to acquire additional systems that would require more troubleshooting than necessary.

10.	LISTING OF ANY SOURCES (IF ANY) THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT:  None.

11.	FUTURE ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIER TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  The Principal Investigator and COTR continue to survey and monitor commercial and technical developments in this market. 

12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my belief and knowledge.
