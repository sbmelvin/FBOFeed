This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This is a Request for Quotes  and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, F33660-03-Q-7000, is a request for a price quotation for a One Year Subscription Service for Worldwide Standards and Vendor Data.

Offers will be evaluated and AFMETCAL will require access to a website with a password to evaluate proposals.  This acquisition is UNRESTRICTED.  General Information:  Managing the large volume of technical information from internal and external sources is critical to the completion of AFMETCAL?s mission.  AFMETCAL requires a single comprehensive suite of information in electronic media to assist their engineers and technical professionals in making better, faster and more cost-effective decisions.  This online information is to consist of a collection of specifications, standards, and manufacturers? catalogs required to support research and procurement of items in the commercial environment.  Scope:  AFMETCAL requires a single primary source, which provides an array of technical and procurement data through electronic media. This is to support our calibration equipment purchase, calibration determination, and calibration technical order programs.   It is not our intention to purchase a collection of government web sites or links to other commercial web sites.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Technical Aspects:  Must be compatible with the current AFMETCAL desktop workstations using Windows 2000 software.  The service is to include a comprehensive single access point that allows various types of searching and management reports, with the ability to identify specific documents then view and print the actual document pages via desktop workstations.

The contractor must provide toll-free technical and application support.  The contractor must provide a minimum of 1 day on-site training on their services with the contract and on-site support as needed. Specifications and Standards Requirements:  Government Specifications and Standards: The service shall provide as a minimum access to the following document with access to both index and complete and unlimited access to full-text images in PDF and/or ASCII Text:  Military Specifications and Standards.

Joint/Army-Navy Specifications and Standards.  Military/Federal Qualified Products Lists (QPLs).  Qualified Manufacturers Lists (QMLs).  Military Handbooks.  Military Bulletins.  MS Drawings.  AND, ANA, AN Drawings.  DESC/DSCC/SMD Drawings.  Data Item Descriptions (DIDs).  Federal Information Processing Standards.  Historical (cancelled and superseded) documents.  Historical documents will be evaluated based on the most complete offering via electronic access.  This is critical because of the age of equipment of supported equipment.   Note: ASCII Text to over 65,000 Military & Federal Specifications and Standards is critical to our ability to copy-and-paste portions of these documents into our sourcing materials.  This full-text ASCII provides easy copy-and-paste capabilities into any Word Processor software to expedite project documentation.  Many older documents are only scanned images and the ability to have access to ASCII Text versions has been determined to be a critical requirement when PDF normal is not available.

Document images must include full English translation.  Documents must be updated daily.  System must be able to search based on revision date.  System must provide automatic update notification capabilities.  Documents must be provided via electronic media.  Delivery in hardcopy format that may delay work and reduce readiness will not be considered an acceptable alternative to electronic access to these documents (SEE NOTE 1).  Specifications and Standards Search Requirements: The system must allow the user to locate specific military information by the following methods:  All Military/DoD, Government, and Non-Government documents must be included in the same product using the same search engine.  The index must include not only Military/Government documents but also DoD adopted industry standards and industry standards.  Searching by document number or portion of a document number, including alpha prefixes and decimal points.  Keywords must be searchable from the index in the Title of the document, Scope/Intended Use/Keyword paragraphs and from the document outline for all documents that include this information.  Keyword searching of the full-text of DODISS documents from the index and the ability to copy-and-paste this information into any Word Processor.  This full-text ASCII provides easy copy-and-paste capabilities into any Word Processor software to expedite project documentation.  Searching by Federal Supply Class (FSC) and. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Searching by Preparing Organization.  The product must have the capability to conduct a search by specific document type.  For example, search by Military Specifications, Federal Specifications, etc.  Combination or Boolean searching must be possible.  Each search query should provide the user with a Results List.  The Results List must identify the document number, active or historical status, publication date, the document title, and show the active and historical document list with links to those documents when available.  It must also provide links to QPLs and FLIS information when available to help expedite sourcing information and technical requirements.  Document Reports: The service must make available the following reports: A document summary that provides Scope and Intended use information for Government and DoD adopted standards.  Keywords assigned by the author of the document, for example see Document Summary for MIL-STD-1580A.  Additional management information such as applicable QPLs, DIDs, etc.  Links to QPL and FLIS data when applicable for DODISS documents.  An Applicable Documents report that lists all documents referenced within the document for Government and DoD Adopted standards.  Links to applicable documents.  Responsible Activities report that includes addresses, phone/fax numbers, and email addresses for the Preparing Activity, Custodians, Reviewers and the Society/Organization.  A history of the document to include the date of the base document as well as any revisions or amendments, with links to those documents.  A complete document outline that allows the user to go from the index directly to the paragraph, sub-paragraph, or section level rather than simply the first page of the document.  The report information must be printable.   OTE 1: Clarification regarding hardcopy delivery.  AFMETCAL has initiated many new initiatives to move to a paperless environment to improve our mission response time.  This is a result of decreased headcount and the need for better quality and compliance control of documents.  To that end, we cannot and will not consider hardcopy delivery as a replacement for electronic delivery when and if electronic delivery is available from a potential vendor.  We also understand that the management of maintaining, updating, and sharing individual hardcopy documents would not be practical and may lead to copyright infringements and non-compliance issues when using Non-Government Standards.  Manufacturers' Catalogs: Provide a catalog service that allows simple, full-text searching on manufacturers? catalogs.  The database must be searched by any combination of the following fields:  Keyword, Part Number (which can include any numeric searches; e.g., part number, referenced document number, NIIN, NSN, etc.), Manufacturer Name (includes old names, alternate names or GSA contractor number). Both PDF and non-PDF documents are searchable and accessible in this database.  The database must allow searching for manufacturers catalogs by any of the following: Street Address, City, State, Zip/Postal Code, Country, Telephone #, Fax #, SIC Code, NAICS Code, CAGE Code with a result of the actual vendors catalog or data sheet.  The results list from any search must produce a single list of results with the ability to view manufactures information and/or full-text catalogs from that results page.  It is also critical that the service sorts the results based on best match to the search criteria with the best matches appearing first.  The service must provide the ability to locate products by industry or military standard, such as ASTM A276 or MIL-STD-1290.  It must also provide the ability to combine the search for a product by industry or military standard, keyword, and /or manufacturer such as MIL-STD-1290 and fuel valve.   Access to a service containing commercial and military parts is required and the service must include full-text database to both commercial vendor and GSA information.  It must contain full-text document pages of supplier catalogs, data sheets, and related documents, and contains GSA supply schedules, contractor information, and related publications.  All COTS or government-approved sources for items and information can be searched, viewed, and printed using the same product and the same search engine.  Access to partial catalog information, URL links to the vendor?s web page or on-line catalog information is not acceptable.  The service must include an automatic word thesaurus to link related terms, enabling technical and procurement personnel to search for a part using familiar language.  A category filtering option allows results to be displayed across the entire database or by subject area or industry (e.g., Materials, Marine, Aerospace, GSA).  This allows for targeted results, saving valuable research time.  The user must be able to find manufacturer or distributor information for the item searched.  This information is to include manufacturer listings for all vendors and distributors with catalogs in the database.  These listings contain addresses, sales office listings, contact information, NAICS/SIC/CAGE codes and URL links to manufacturer's websites where available.  As of 1 Oct 1997, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database as a condition of award.  Quotes should be directed to Carol Zigan, Contract Specialist, at AFMETCAL Det 1, 813 Irving-Wick Dr W., Bldg 2, Heath OH  43056-6116.  PHONE 740-788-5042, FAX 740-788-5157.  E-Mail carol.zigan@afmetcal.af.mil.  Offers are due no later than 4:00 P.M. E.D.T. on 31 Oct 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The General Services announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings.  Project Summary:  GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for all construction services necessary to construct a new GSA Federal Building in Washington, DC.  The GSA Federal Building will be an agency headquarters office building of approximately 422,000 GSF.  The estimated construction cost is $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.  All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards.  The facility will be located on a 6.14-acre site at Florida and New York Avenues, N.E., Washington, DC.  The project will be comprised of three office wings, all inter-connected by an enclosed atrium, and an underground garage with parking for 200 vehicles.  The northern wing will be a crescent-shaped tower, six stories above grade.  The southern and eastern rectangular wings will be eight stories above grade.  The facility will include a private garden, approximately one acre that will be bounded by a punctuated garden wall demising structure.  The office areas will be primarily open-space planned facilities with under-floor air distribution through an approximate 12 inch raised floor plenum.  The project will include non-office spaces, such as a training facility, auditorium, press facilities, library, and fitness center.  Security, which is a major concern to the tenant agency, will be reflected in the design of the building, including physical security, blast mitigation design, and electronic security.  The project is being designed to meet LEED certification.  Procurement Strategy:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, GSA will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal to price.  The selection process will have two stages. Stage I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Stage II.  Stage II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value.  In Stage I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors.  Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ.  The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Stage II of the procurement.  Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Stage I will not be allowed to participate in the remaining stage of the procurement.  In Stage II, the Government will issue the RFP, which will include the 100% construction drawings, to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Stage I that elect to participate in Stage II.  The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Stage II.  The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP.  Price offers that exceed $80,000,000 will be considered unacceptable and will be rejected.  Based on the Stage I and Stage II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government.  The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Stage I and Stage II offers without discussions.  The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about October 18, 2002, on the Internet at:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Opportunities for Other than Large Businesses:  This procurement will be open to large and small business firms.  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and FAR Subpart 19.702, an offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a subcontracting plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.  In this procurement, GSA intends to promote subcontractors' use of registered apprenticeship programs.

<SUBJECT>C -- A/E Design Services For The Major Modification Of The Herbert C. Hoover Building, Washington, DC
<SOLNBR>GS11P03MKC0004
<RESPDATE>111202
<CONTACT>Vincent Matner, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 260-6707, Fax (202) 708-8332, Email vince.matner@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), National Capital Region, Washington, D.C. announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture.  The GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services for the design of a major modernization of the Herbert C. Hoover Building (HCHB), Department of Commerce.  The HCHB is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the Federal Triangle between Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues and 14th and 15th Streets, NW, in Washington, DC.  The HCHB was built in 1932 and was the largest building in the world for its time.  The building is approximately 171,865 gross square meters (1.85 million gross square feet) in size.  A new 11,148 gross square meters (120,000 gross square feet) courtyard infill is planned that will serve as internal swing space during the modernization.  The project is programmed in six construction phases. The Estimated Construction Cost (ECC) range is $300 to $350 million.  The modernization will be designed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: develop micro-program of tenant requirements, phasing plans, metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), and post construction contract services for restoring and modernizing a headquarters facility.  Upon completion of the proposed modernization, the building will be a modern office building capable of serving well past another 50 years. The HCHB set a precedent for the buildings in the Federal Triangle with its limestone facades, ornate colonnades, and rich sculptural embellishments.  The striking exterior is matched in grandeur by the rich ornamentation of the interior. Built with 37 acres of floor space and 8 miles of corridors, the building's imposing size and scale was designed to symbolize both the importance of commerce in the economic development of the United States, and the ideals of City Beautiful planning promoted by Federal Triangle planners.   A great public space within the building is the Patent Search Room, now utilized by the National Park Service as the White House Visitor center.  The basement level houses the National Aquarium, which is the first public aquarium in the country. The building has been operated for nearly 70 years without major renovations.  Some building systems were replaced and require life cycle analysis to justify their continued use, or replacement for this project. The existing HVAC system removed a portion of the building's historic fabric and installation of the new system will provide restoration of what was removed.  The modernization will include replacement of the interior, including all finishes, existing mechanical and electrical distribution, existing toilet rooms, stairs, domestic water, plus restoration of historic corridors.  Increased structural modifications to comply with current security and geophysical standards will be analyzed and considered.  The exterior of the building will be cleaned, and repaired to its original grandeur.  Consideration will be given to special use facilities co-located with the building (childcare facilities and the Patent Law Library).  The project will comply with standards for sustainable design, energy conservation, accessibility, and include GSA design standards for secure facilities.  The A/E selection will be completed in the following stages.  STAGE I:  The first stage will establish the experience and capabilities of the A/E Design Firm, and its lead designer. The A/E Design Firm is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building's architecture and engineering systems.  A/E design firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the National Capital Region (NCR).  The NCR includes the District of Columbia, the City of Baltimore, the Counties of Montgomery, Prince Georges, Howard, Anne Arundel, and Baltimore in Maryland; the Cities of Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax, and Manassas, and the Counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William, and Loudoun in Virginia.   The government will not allow payment for travel within the NCR, living expenses, computer time or hookups for the A/E Design Firm or the consultants.  Interested firms will submit the Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project).  In Block 8 of the SF-254 specify only current W-2 payroll (non-contract) personnel of the A-E design firm. Complete the SF 255 as follows: On page 3, complete items 1 through 4, inclusive. Do not respond to item 5. On pages 4-10 inclusive, no response is required. On page 11, under item 10, respond to the Stage I evaluation criteria stated in this announcement. And in block 11, sign, name, title, and date the submittal.  Identification of consultants/subcontractors (team members) is not required at this stage.  Each firm will be evaluated during this stage using the following four CRITERIA: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):  The A/E design firm will submit graphics (maximum of three single sided pages per project with maximum graphic size not to exceed 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch) of five historic renovation projects, construction completed within the last ten years of the Stage I submission due date.  At least two projects shall demonstrate mechanical and electrical system's installation in a historic building.  The narrative (maximum of two typewritten single sided 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, occupancy; economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall planning/design/engineering solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section.  (2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical) (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten single sided 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch pages for each of the 3 above disciplines) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in renovating a historic headquarters office building.  (3) LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical) (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three typewritten single sided 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch pages for each of the 3 above disciplines) including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts inclusive of project examples. Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project example.  (4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical) (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three single sided 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch pages per project), and a typewritten description (maximum of two single sided 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch pages per project) of up to three historic renovation projects, construction completed within the last ten years of the Stage I submission due date.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall planning/design solution.  Where there is duplication with criterion (1) above, the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project.  The Stage I short-list selection will be based on the above four criteria.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, representatives of the client, and GSA personnel will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short list of at least three firms.   The Stage I short list will be published in Fedbizopps approximately four to eight weeks following the due date for Stage I submissions.  STAGE II:  In the second stage of evaluation, each of the short-listed firms will submit information for the total project team.  The project team shall be considered to include the A/E design firm, its designated lead designer, and all outside consultants who will be involved on the project.  The A/E design firm must identify the contractual relationship it has with the lead designer and all total project team consultants.  A sufficient period will be provided for the short-listed A/E design firms to establish the total project team and to respond to the Stage II requirements.

<DESC>NIH intends to procure on a sole basis to Professional Services for housekeeping services to additional assign areas within the Clinical Center.  The contractor shall provide cleaning services to assign areas for Option Years 3 and 4 totaling 161,740 square feet.  This requirement will be obtained through a modification of NIH Contract No. N02-CL-00005 with Professional Services.  It is believed that Professional Services is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 because of the continued services and the OMB Circular A-76 prescribing a further transition to contract services where feasible in the current contract for housekeeping services.  The period of performance will be for the duration of the Contract No. N02-CL-00005.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Pharmaceutical Resources Branch (PRB), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking to develop and produce pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral dosage forms of promising new agents with activity against cancer. Certain agents selected by the NCI, DCTD, Cancer Operating Committees will be assigned for development and production as parenteral products (primarily sterile freeze dried products).  Batch sizes will range from small development batches (less than 500) to intermediate size batches to be used in Phase I and II trials; however, escalation to large batch size for Phase III trials is possible.  The capability to develop and manufacture other pharmaceutical dosage forms (i.e., large volume parenteral, sterile emulsions, sterile micro-dispersions, liposomes, etc) is desirable but not essential.  Data obtained from the contract(s) will: 1) be used to support IND applications submitted by the National Cancer Institute to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2) be provided to other NCI contractors engaged in large scale dosage form manufacture and analytical evaluation of these dosage forms, and 3) be provided to physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other medical personnel handling these products in a clinical setting. An offeror  must meet the following Mandatory Qualification Criteria at the time of proposal submission, in order for the proposal to be considered any further for award: The Contractor must be registered with the FDA as a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility for sterile products. The Contractor should show proof (FDA form 483) of routine FDA inspection(s) within the last two years. Moreover, the Contractor  must be in compliance with FDA requirements during the course of the contract performance.  All chemicals and drugs handled during the contact should be regarded as potentially toxic and should be handled accordingly.  Offerors will be instructed to describe their safety program and their proposed approach for the handling of toxic agents.  Proposals will be evaluated as to the adequacy of their facilities and their proposed method of handling these agents. It is anticipated that two (2) cost reimbursement completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years.  The proposed contract project represents a recompetition of Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. Contract No. NO1-CM-77020. All responsible offerors will be considered.   The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately October 31, 2002.  The proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) wishes to pre-qualify suppliers who can develop, implement, manage and analyze information for a national Customer Satisfaction Measurement (CSM) system.  The purpose of this system is to provide an independent, continuous measure of the satisfaction levels of the Postal Service's customers.  Suppliers included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes or to provide proposals in response to a solicitation issued by the USPS.  It is the intent of the USPS to award CSM system contract(s) using the pre-qualified suppliers. 
 
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  Prequalification does not constitute a contract award.  It is a business decision of the Purchase Team to pre-qualify.  The USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if the needs or vision of the USPS change.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Request for Information section of the attached document.  Potential suppliers must submit a separate statement for each segment of the CSM system for which they wish to pre-qualify:  Business, Residential, and/or Conceptualization and Analysis.

<DESC>THE PRIMARY POINT-OF-CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS:  Ms. Tracey Washington, (540) 710-5080.  This is a Request for Information (RFI). Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is seeking information from commercial vendors whose products, tools and/or toolkits are designed to support certificate-based domain access control.  Specifically, comments and information are being sought on the following Requirement Specification for a Certificate-based Network Logon Capability in a Microsoft Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server environment utilizing the DoD Common Access Card (CAC) hardware token.  The CAC contains DoD Class 3 PKI certificates.  WHS is seeking input from vendors on the architectural direction and concept of Certificate-based Network Logon as described Requirements Specification included in this RFI.  It is the intent of WHS to use vendor input from the commercial e-security supplier space to refine, make adjustments, and evolve the Requirements Specification for Certificate-based Network Logon.  WHS desires to interact with vendors, obtain evaluation copies of applicable products, and conduct independent tests to determine if products should be incorporated into the DoD solution for Certificate-based Network Logon.  This is an RFI and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued.  The government invites comments and interested parties to submit their indication of interest, along with:  documentation addressing the technical specifications of their products, tools or toolkits; the costs to the government for the product; a point of contact for technical question about the product; any proprietary/non-disclosure data requirements and availability for testing in a proof of concept lab.  The government does not intend to otherwise pay for information received in response to the RFI.  The products, tools and toolkits submitted will be evaluated to determine if they are compatible with open standards and can be integrated with the DoD PKI. WHS expects to invite selected vendors to its proof of concept lab to demonstrate the capabilities of their products, or to demonstrate the ability of their tools and/or toolkits to directly provide a solution for certificate-based network logon.  There is no implied promise that all products, tools or toolkits submitted in response to this RFI will be invited to demonstrate capabilities. WHS will determine which products are selected according to the needs of the Department. The results of the testing will be made available to all vendors chosen to demonstrate their products.  Vendors should include FIPS compliance and NIAP certification results as applicable.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response.  To receive a copy of the actual requirements for this RFI, vendors should send email to:  tracey.washington@gsa.gov.  Firms who wish to respond to this should send responses via email NLT October 26, 2002.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW: The GPS III program objective is to develop and deploy an improved space and ground segment for the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) to assure reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity, and timing (PVT) signals to meet the evolving needs of GPS civil and military users.  GPS III eliminates numerous existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities inherent in the current GPS architecture that threaten to severely impact vital civil commerce, transportation, public safety, as well as military operations in the future.  GPS III enhances U.S. leadership in space-based navigation by meeting the stated Presidential goal of establishing GPS as a world standard.  GPS III supports the Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP) and will be fully interoperable with all current global radionavigation systems. The GPS III system also incorporates the Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and provides a potential platform for supporting additional synergistic payloads and services. The contract effort of the GPS III program involves the selection of a single prime contractor to complete the systems engineering, deliver a control segment, and develop, launch and test on-orbit four (4) development satellite vehicles.  During this stage, the Government will request space vehicle production proposals and seek formal program approval to field the GPS III system.  The Government intends to use an evolutionary acquisition approach.  This approach includes using modular open systems architecture, standard interfaces and protocols, and continuous technology refresh, to incrementally improve system capabilities with a low risk of GPS service interruption. 

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (for any resulting solicitation): This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) and SAP/SAR (Special Access Program/Special Access Requirements) security requirements.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations. A foreign disclosure review of the technical data has been accomplished and GPS III technical data are subject to export controls.   Therefore, only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of any resulting solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.
