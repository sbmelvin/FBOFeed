<DESC>Synopsis: Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) - This announcement constitutes notice of intent that the C2ISR Directorate (HS) Operational C2 Division, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to The AEgis Technologies Group, Inc., 410 Jan Davis Drive NW, Huntsville, AL 35806-2801 (the incumbent contractor), for software integration, development, and maintenance support for the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) program.  The maximum ordering amount of this contract will be $55.9M. The AEgis Technologies Group, Inc. is being awarded this sole source IDIQ contract to provide ongoing contractor support for AFMSTT users, which is critical to the program. This IDIQ contract was deemed necessary to be established by the contracting officer, where fiscal law considerations require migration of the primary and secondary O&M and secondary RDT&E requirements under the recently!  awarded AFMSTT contract (FA8731-10-C-0003; awarded 28 Apr 10) to a new indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The requirements that will necessitate a modification of the current AFMSTT contract to an IDIQ contract recently came to light. The ordering period for this IDIQ contract will be from  the date of contract award through 27 April 2013.  The period of performance for all work required under task orders to be placed against this IDIQ contract will begin on the date of contract award and end on 27 April 2013.  The purpose of this contracting action is to acquire the highly specialized AFMSTT support of AEgis to perform Secondary R&D as well as both Primary and Secondary O&M to include planning, development and integration of prioritized CRs/DRs (including "pop-up" Urgent CRs/DRs), technical refresh, Certification & Accreditation (C&A), Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI), Open Technology Development, 3rd party integration, Sy! stems Engineering/Program Management, Data Management, Test & Evaluation (T&E), Quality Assurance, Configuration Management, Development/Test Environment and Exercise/Event support for the proper appropriation and funding sources (primary or secondary) as required. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, and it should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. This action is authorized under 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(2)(iii)(B), which states that for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The Government intends to make an award on or about 25 March 2011. No technical data/drawings/Technical Orders are availabl! e.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Its issuanc does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Nevertheless, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with proprietary legend without written permission from the respondent.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.

The Request for Proposal will be posted on the Natick Contracting Centers website; www3.natick.army.mil, on or about March 15th, 2011. <BR><BR>This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The potential contract could cover a total period of five years. The requirement for each annual increment could be up to 300,000 with a minimal quantity for the first year is 30,000 IBA vests. <BR><BR>Soldiers deploying to theatre are provided with Interceptor Body Armor (IBA) vests by the ARMY to help protect them from small arms and ballistic fragments.  Having been used in theatre, the IBA vests usually become heavily soiled with dirt, perspiration, and body fluid.  These soiled IBA vests cannot be reissued to the Soldiers without proper cleaning as they would present a health risk to the Soldiers. <BR><BR>Due to the supply shortage of IBA vests, ARMY has the critical ongoing need to clean the soiled IBA vests returned from the field to resupply the cleaned IBA vests to the deploying Soldiers.<BR><BR>Improper cleaning methods, procedures and detergents, however, can damage or degrade the performance of the IBA vests.  A recent IOTV cleaning study, conducted by Soldier-Product Support Integration Directorate (S-PSID) in conjunction with Program Manager - Soldier Protection Individual Equipment (PM-SPIE), has identified Computer-controlled Wet Cleaning to be the best value solution, which can clean effectively the IBA vests without degrading their functional properties.  A Maintenance Action Message was published authorizing the use Computer-controlled Wet Cleaning as a viable depot maintenance procedure for cleaning the soiled IBA vests, and the new procedures are now published in the IBA Technical Manual (TM 10-8470-208-24&P).<BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the OSAP, Organization for Safety, Asepsis and Prevention to procure a Bloodborne Pathogens Compliance Study.
<p>Project Objective: The purpose is to ensure the blood borne pathogens exposure control plans are effectively implemented in private dental offices and dental clinics, an important segment of the non-hospital based healthcare system; and to understand how effective implementation strategies may be applied to other healthcare settings.<br /><br />Background and Need:</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that healthcare workers sustain nearly 600,000 percutaneous injuries annually involving contaminated sharps. In response to both the continued concern over such exposures and the technological developments which can increase employee protection, Congress passed the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act directing OSHA to revise the bloodborne pathogens (BBP) standard to establish requirements that employers identify and make use of effective and safer medical devices. That revision was published on Jan. 18, 2001, and became effective April 18, 2001.</p>
<p>The Organization for Safety and Asepsis and Prevention (OSAP) is a unique group of dental educators and consultants, researcher, clinicians, industry representatives, and other interested persons with a collective mission to be the world's leading advocate for the safe and infection-free delivery of oral care. OSAP supports this commitment to dental workers and the public through quality education and information dissemination. OSAP's unique membership includes the variety of partners critical to gather the data on compliance with the OSHA bloodborne pathogens standard, identify barriers and develop strategies to overcome barriers to compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13255. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>The subject requirement is for the acquisition of 27 NSNs with various item descriptions and end items being bought to various manufacturer's part numbers as shown further below. The FSCs of this requirement are: 1095, 2510, 2520, 2530, 2540, 2910, 2920, 2930, 2940 and 4910. An Indefinite Quantity Long-Term Contract with a base year and 4 option years is anticipated. The total duration base plus option years shall not exceed 5 years. Solicitation is unrestricted. Other than Full &amp; Open Competition applies. The solicitation will be available on March 17, 2011 at https://dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Trade Agreements Act applies to FSG 25, 29, and 49. Quantity ranges and delivery schedule will be noted on the RFP. FOB Destination is required. Inspection/Acceptance requirements will be noted on RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote, which shall be considered. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identify will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

<DESC>This is a sources sought Market Survey posted in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management Policy (AMS) 3.2.1.2.1.  This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the FAA to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the FAA to a particular acquisition approach.  Responses to this market survey are for informational purposes only and submissions are made on a voluntary basis.  Responses will not be returned.  No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of submissions in response to this market survey or the FAA's use of such information.   Responses to this Market Survey may factor into the development of an acquisition strategy and a future request for proposal.

The government has identified the principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical system and Instrument Manufacturing.  
The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a mission critical, Safety of Life (SoL) navigation system within the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS).  WAAS provides LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, LPV, and LPV-200 levels of navigation services.  The WAAS currently uses Global Position System (GPS) L1 C/A and L2 P(Y) semi-codeless signals.  The United States Government Federal Register Notice that DOD support of GPS L2 codeless/semi-codeless capability will likely be ended in 2020.
The FAA intends to replace the use of L2 P(Y) semi-codeless with the use of the GPS L5 civil signal under the WAAS Phase IV - Dual Frequency Operation.  In addition to the WAAS ground system transition from the use of semi-codeless L2 to the L5 civil signal under WAAS Phase IV activities, the FAA also plans to introduce a new dual frequency SBAS navigation service while retaining legacy single frequency user services.  
The purpose of this announcement is to assess the availability of potential sources capable of developing and deploying operational hardware and software changes necessary to complete WAAS Phase IV, Dual Frequency Operations.  
Interested parties must submit a Capability Statement addressing the areas itemized below.  Whenever recent experience is requested, it will be limited to that experience which has occurred within the past five (5) years.  Additional information regarding this requirement is contained in the documents attached with this announcement entitled "Additional Dual Frequency Descriptive Information" and "HMI analysis for Dual Frequency WAAS".
Interest parties must submit a Capability Statement addressing the following:
1. A brief description of the company's business size, location and business status, ie, large, small, women-owned, etc. 
2.   Business Declaration Form - Interested vendors will complete the attached Business Declaration Form.  Respondents must provide an indication of the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.  
3.   A copy of the vendor's SBA 8(a) Certification Letter, if applicable.
4.   Justification for an alternate NAICS code, if applicable.
5. Does your company have experience in developing, validating and fielding software intensive modifications to an operational system comparable to WAAS?  If yes, provide details outlining your specific experience in each area indicated.
6. Does your company have knowledge of, and experience with, the design, assurance and operations of satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) or ground based augmentation systems (GBAS)?  If yes, provide details outlining your specific knowledge and experience in each area indicated.
7. Has your company developed and delivered software systems in accordance with RTCA DO-178B, in particular Level B?
8. Identify the list of information required to bid on the Assurance Level B software re-hosting for this development.

<DESC>Market Survey Announcement for Office Equipment
In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), T3.2.1.2, "Market Analysis", Industry is hereby notified that the FAA intends to award a national contract for printers and multi-function devices (MFDs). The purpose of this Market Survey is to:
	Gather industry input regarding contract structure, bid and award of a national contract for Office Equipment, including printers and multi-function devices (MFDs).	Propose the criteria for vendor down-selection process to ensure qualified vendor participation.	Gain insight into industry's supply chain capabilities to meet the requirement of providing products and services to over 800 FAA facilities nationwide.	Gather industry perspective on the proposed draft statement of work to ensure FAA's success in meeting the office equipment requirements nationwide.
This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing information, documentation, and or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this notice.
The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Since this is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents. 
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do an unrestricted open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  
The principle North American Industry Classification System NAIC codes for this effort are:
	424120, "Stationary and Office Supplies Merchant Wholesalers".  The size standard in terms of number of employees is 100.	532420, "Office Machinery and Equipment Rental & Leasing.  The size standard in terms of dollars is $25 million.





In order to make the determination regarding the nature of competition for this requirement, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:1.  Is there a wider supplier base if we solicited the categories for standard printers, MFD's, mobile printers and plotters separately or together?
 2.   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of awarding a contract to an office equipment Value Added Reseller (VAR) or to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in terms of pricing, product availability, technical and product warranty support, technology roadmap, etc.
 3.   Propose how an MFD Service Maintenance Plan should be structured in terms of service calls, monthly usage levels/cost per copy.  Should fleet plans or ad-hoc service calls be considered an alternative to engaging annual maintenance plans?
4.  Suggest the best practice for determining the printer and MFD model device speeds in order to be fair and inclusive of all sellers. For instance, should device capability be based on maximum monthly usage, a specific speed range (copies per minute), the number of users mapped to each device or is another metric more reasonable? 
5.  Describe your national supply chain infrastructure (warehouses, distributors, etc.) and how it would fulfill the FAA requirement of providing printers and MFD to over 800 FAA locations in the contiguous United States. Provide examples how your company's supply chain structure is the optimum solution for the FAA.
6.  Please review the attached DRAFT Statement of Work and provide comments or suggestions to ensure the FAA achieves success in areas of product suitability, availability and distribution, as well as maximizing opportunities for continued cost savings.
7.  Describe your company's government experience managing a contract of a similar scope and size referenced in the Statement of Work.
8.  Describe your previous experience if any, using a reverse auction bidding tool and provide comments on applying this strategy to this requirement. 
  9.  Please identify and prioritize the criteria and key discriminators the FAA should consider in making a vendor down-select or award decision?
10.  Complete the following table indicating your ability or intent to respond to FAA's requirements for national contract on printers and MFDs:
	I would compete for (check all that apply) ______ Printers   ______MFDs	  _____Mobile Printers    _________Plotter Printers _______"All Four"	I currently provide this service of similar scope and size (Yes/No) ______	I would partner to provide this service (Yes/No) ______	If you do not plan to compete, please comment on the reason:

Comments on the Draft SOW are not considered part of the question answering submission page limit.  The government may or may not incorporate changes into the draft SOW based on the submitted comments.Business Declaration - Vendors must complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space FlightCenter is releasing a Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) Broad Agency Announcement(BAA) in support of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). The BAA will be available onMarch 1, 2011, by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/	 and then linking through the menu listingsSolicitations to Open Solicitations. This announcement solicits proposals for the demonstration of space technologies thatprovide new system-level technological capabilities. OCT TDM is seeking to identifycandidate crosscutting, system-level technologies to be demonstrated in the relevantenvironment such as ground, air, suborbital or orbital regimes. A key requirement in thisprogram is that the technology under consideration must clearly be crosscutting.Crosscutting is defined as a technology with potential to benefit more than one customer,where a customer can be a NASA Mission Directorate, another government agency, academia,or the aerospace industry. Specifically, system-level technologies implies anintegrated system with mission capability and not component-level demonstrations. OCT isseeking new capability demonstrations that advance the technology readiness of theselected systems, provide tangible, innovative technology products, are cost effective,and capture significant public interest and awareness. The candidate technology must bemature, at least Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 at the time of the proposalsubmission, and the proposed demonstration must raise the technology readiness of the newcapability,  to TRL 7 or higher, such that it may be infused into the critical path forfuture missions.  This announcement solicits technology demonstration proposals in the following fourfocused technology areas: High Bandwidth Deep Space Communication, Navigation, and TimingCommunication and navigation are enabling services that are required by all spacecraft.Advancement in communication and navigation technology will allow future missions toimplement new and more capable science instruments, greatly enhance human missions beyondEarth orbit, and enable entirely new mission concepts. Future mission requirements drivethe need for increased navigation precision and enhanced communication solutions.Demonstrations that advance high bandwidth deep space communications capabilities are ofinterest. Navigation technologies that significantly enhance timing accuracy as well asautonomous navigation techniques for precise spacecraft maneuvers are of interest.Systems that integrate technology developed across communication and navigation are alsoof interest. The capability can be self-contained or distributed, such as a constellationof two or more spacecraft flying in relatively close formation that together demonstratean aperture or baseline that is larger and more capable.Orbital Debris Mitigation or Removal SystemsOver the course of 50+ years of space activities, over 500,000 man-made objects haveaccumulated in Earth orbit, ranging from low to geosynchronous altitudes and beyond.These objects pose long-term dangers to current and future space missions. Once theseobjects are accurately located and tracked, methods must be developed to de-orbit,destroy, collect, or divert these objects. This solicitation seeks proposals for thedemonstration of systems capable of mitigation or removal of small debris (1-10centimeters), as well as systems capable of mitigation or removal of large objects (10+centimeters) from Earth orbit.	Advanced In-Space Propulsion SystemsIn-space propulsion begins where launch vehicle upper stage propulsion leaves off,providing primary propulsion and orbital maneuvering capabilities. Advanced in-spacepropulsion technologies will enable much more effective exploration of the solar systemby allowing mission designers to plan more robust missions with shorter trip times andlower costs. This solicitation is seeking proposals to demonstrate novel in-space systemsproviding primary propulsion capabilities. Systems utilizing green propellants, solarsails, tethers, beamed-energy propulsion and other advanced systems are of interest. Note: Solar Electric Propulsion, Nuclear systems and Aerocapture technology demonstrationmissions are not solicited in this BAA.Autonomous Rendezvous, Docking, Close Proximity Operations and Formation FlyingThe ability of space assets to autonomously rendezvous and dock enables human and scienceexploration, as well as satellite servicing/rescue, and is an essential capability forthe future of human and robotic missions. One of the challenges for autonomous rendezvousand docking is proximity operations. Proximity operations to targets such as spacecraft,space telescopes or Near Earth Objects (NEOs) will require advanced autonomous rendezvousand coupling technologies. Objects like NEOs that lack docking infrastructure, and mayalso be tumbling, are particularly challenging. This solicitation is seekingdemonstrations of full autonomy and automation of rendezvous, docking, close proximityoperations and formation flying that would provide future missions with a ready-to-flycapability that is reliable, versatile, cost-effective, and could be utilized in eitherlow Earth orbit or deep space.For crosscutting space technology demonstrations, such as those sought in this BAA, costsharing (a goal of at least 25% is desired) of the total life cycle costs from a sourceother than NASA OCT is required. Cost sharing can be through in-kind contributions and/orfunding provided after ATP. A signed, dated Letter of Commitment shall be provided fromsource(s) funding or in-kind contributions outside of OCT. It is anticipated thatfirm-fixed-price contracts with priced options will be awarded for this effort.  Anappropriate interagency or intra-agency agreement will be used for awardees of Federalentities. Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all proposers shall use NASAs proposaldata system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com     ). In addition, the electronicproposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.Participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educationalinstitutions, industry, nonprofit organizations, Federally Funded Research andDevelopment Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), the JetPropulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. Everyorganization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this BAA must be registeredwith NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizationalrepresentative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Potential proposers andproposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well inadvance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure andenter the requested information. Specific proposal submission deadline dates, evaluationcriteria, and submission information will be identified in the BAA. Proposals will be dueon May 31, 2011. Awards based on this solicitation are contingent on availability  of appropriated funds.Obtain additional programmatic information from: Bonnie James/NASA HQ Email:bonnie.f.james@nasa.gov

<CONTACT>Brenda Hadley, Program Analyst, Phone 256-313-9841, Email brenda.hadley@mda.mil - Janice S Olson, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-313-9497, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC>Introduction<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack. The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase. MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries. MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.
<p>Technical advancement is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years. MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term. The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.</p>
<p>MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS. ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront advanced research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).</p>
<p>The MDA contracts with private industry, qualified accredited domestic educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract, though the government reserves the right to use other types of contractual instruments if they are deemed more appropriate for the proposed work. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Robert Barnes, MDA/DVR; 256-955-7421, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA. Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts. Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2011 through FY 2013.</p>
<p>Research Topics</p>
<p>MDA/DV is interested in development of advanced technology research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment. The following nine ATI research topic areas pertain to the BMDS in all phases of the missile defense threat scenario:</p>
<p>(1) Radar Systems</p>
<p>(2) Lasers and Electro-optical Systems</p>
<p>(3) Integrated Active/Passive IR Sensor Systems</p>
<p>(4) Computer, Signal and Data Processing</p>
<p>(5) Materials and Electronics<br />(6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</p>
<p>(7) Battle Management/Command and Control</p>
<p>(8) Propulsion and Powersystems</p>
<p>(9) International BMDS Cooperation: Proposals for area (9) must contain direct work relating to a foreign company or university that is either a partner or major subcontract under the proposal. This is the only area that we will entertain accepting basic research proposals.</p>
<p>Note: The Government reserves the right to release additional requests for information on any of the above listed topics through FedBizOps to evaluate and consider along with white paper submissions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following:</p>
<p>(1) A summary concept white paper (no more than ten pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program using the attached Proposal Instructions (Attachment 1). <br />(2) White Paper Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM), using the attached Cost Proposal Instructions paragraph (5). <br />(3) A suggested program plan using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(d).<br />(4) A description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(e).</p>
<p>Note: Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. If selected for award MDA will request a full technical volume and detailed cost proposal as requested in the attached proposal instructions paragraphs (6) (7) and (8). DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offeror's acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e). The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS: <br />MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; <br />(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; <br />(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel which are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; <br />(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; and <br />(5) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offeror's proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror's proposal:</p>
<p>(1) The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; <br />(2) The offerors' capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; <br />(3) The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; and <br />(4) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive. This BAA will remain open until March 1, 2013 and will be reposted in 2012. Submittals will continue to be accepted after the initial response date throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open.</p>
<p>Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This Request for Quotation is for excavation, data recovery, and documentation of archeological site 45WH253 on Ross Lake during reservoir drawdown, approximately mid-April through late June 2011.  The site is located on a flat glacial terrace at ca. 1580 ft elevation and is described as a large, open, pre-contact period lithic scatter provisionally dated between 7,000 and 600 years old, based on diagnostic projectile point fragments and one radiocarbon date.  The site appears to have functioned as a short-term base camp where early- and late-stage bifaces were manufactured from locally-procured tool stone.  The site's annual exposure to reservoir shoreline erosion processes may have altered site conditions since original field testing in 1989-1990.  No pre-contact period human burials, gravesites, ceremonial features, or sacred objects have been recorded or reported at the project area.
The contractor shall employ standard methods for surface mapping of artifacts, site mapping, excavation of shovel or test probes, excavation of stratigraphy trenches and pits, and full-scale excavation using 1x1 and 2x2 m square excavation units, as needed to perform data recovery.   The contractor shall employ standard laboratory and analytic techniques to describe, identify, and classify archeological collections, as well as prepare an inventory of all artifacts recovered from excavation units, to include their provenience, class or artifact category, age assessment, and context (in situ or disturbed).  The contractor shall prepare a report describing laboratory methods, field methods, and their results, along with archeological interpretations of the data that address issues and objectives of the research design.  
LOCATION:  The project area is located within the drawdown zone at the southern end of Ross Lake near Ten Mile Island, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by the National Park Service.  It is comprised of the exposed and devegetated reservoir bottom lands ("drawdown zone"), where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air for a short time each year.  Directions to the site will be provided in the RFQ, but be advised there is no direct road or trail access to this site.  Information about Ross Lake may be found at http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/boating-and-fishing.htm
SITE VISIT:  Offerors are encouraged to participate in a site visit on Tuesday, March 15, 2011.  The purpose of the visit will be to familiarize offerors with the site and the somewhat complicated logistics of getting there.  If you plan to attend, register by e-mail to the COR (bob_mierendorf@nps.gov) by 4:30 pm Friday, March 11.   The site visit will begin at the NPS Curation Building, 7280 Ranger Station Road, Marblemount WA, at 10:00 a.m. and will end there in the mid-afternoon.  Bring a lunch and dress appropriately for a variety of weather conditions.  
SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 541720 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 1, 2011, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  Offers are due at 4:30 pm on March 28, 2011.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Air Force is issuing this repair sources sought announcement as a market survey for repair of the F-16 Combiner Assembly listed below, for the purpose of conducting market research. The Government is seeking potential sources for repair of the following asset(s):<br />NSN: 1270-99-179-7577WF Part Number: 049836 Noun: Combiner Assembly
<p>Responses to this announcement shall consist of an initial White Paper (not to exceed 3 pages) describing the offeror's capabilities and experience with regard to trouble shooting, testing, and repairing the F-16 Combiner Assembly. The Government does not own any parts lists or Air Force technical orders listing the parts/pieces of these combiners nor do they own any repair manuals. The Government does not own the technical data package.&nbsp; The Government does not have any test equipment for the F-16 Combiner Assembly.</p>
<p>Should a requirement for this repair service develop, the statutory authority that will be used is 10 USC 2304(c) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available for only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. The potential contract action would be for the support and repair of the NSN asset(s) listed above, for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of source(s) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source. It is currently considered that Qioptiq, Ltd is the only source that has the requisite skills, equipment, capabilities, system expertise, proprietary drawings, and resources to accomplish the required repair of these items.</p>
<p>The engineer has determined that only sources that have met qualification requirements will be considered to perform this repair. Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) access to the proprietary drawings and the legal right to use them in performance of repair services for the U.S. Government or the ability to get them, (2) the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements; (3) employees with satisfactory qualifications to perform the work; and (4) the necessary equipment, facilities, and material or the ability to obtain them to appropriately repair the Combiner Assembly assets listed above.</p>
<p>This notice is a sources sought notice, and is not a request for competitive proposals, quotations or an invitation for bid. Response is voluntary and the Government assumes no liability to reimburse contractors for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided. These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding contractor. Information provided will be used solely for acquisition planning and market research purposes in determining the competitive atmosphere for this requirement.</p>
<p>This request for sources sought information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished and responding to this request in no manner guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent. The information provided is to the best of the Government's knowledge of plans, desires, and general situation as it exists at this time. This requirement is in the acquisition planning phase and, therefore, all information provided herein is potentially subject to change.<br /><br />For contractual information contact Julianne B. Gibby, (801) 775-2360, via fax at (801) 7770389, or via email at <a href="mailto:julianne.gibby@hill.af.mil">julianne.gibby@hill.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />For technical information contact Jack Jones (801) 775-4587 or via email at <a href="mailto:jackie.jones@hill.af.mil">jackie.jones@hill.af.mil</a>. <br /></p>

<DESC>Small Digital Data Link (SDDL) for Small Unmanned Aerial Systems and Munitions<BR>Request for Information <BR>Sources Sought Synopsis: <BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) <BR>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the potential development of a Small Digital Data Link (SDDL) for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions. <BR>The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, capability, price, innovative research and development methodology and other information in planning the development of a SDDL. This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the development of a SDDL designed to provide a secure data link for control and sensor data for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions over the operating temperatures ranges from -40 degrees Fahrenheit to +140 degrees Fahrenheit and withstand storage from -40 degrees Fahrenheit to +140 degrees Fahrenheit. High humidity shall not degrade operations.<BR>As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical data describing the proposed concept and innovative methodology information to assist in the following: (1) Determine the ability of current and near term emerging technology to support an SDDL, (2) Identify feasible alternatives that meet the objectives stated below, (3) Determine the approximate research and development cost and schedule, and end-item cost information for each alternative, and (4) Determine the estimated performance characteristics and risks associated with each alternative. Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper containing a description of the above areas of interest. Information on available, emerging, or required technologies and how these technologies could be applied to this project should also be included.<BR>Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper containing a description of the above areas of interest. Submissions should focus on information concerning available, emerging, or required SDDL technologies, circuit miniaturization technology and information assurance technologies for which proof-of-concept has been demonstrated at least at the subsystem/component level, and for which an implementation roadmap for a form-factored system solution has been identified and is clearly communicated. The white paper responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the technologies identified above would be integrated into an SDDL materiel solution, tested, and qualified for military application in a typical military operating environment.<BR>Interested and capable sources may respond to one or all of the following technical areas.<BR>1. Complete SDDL system solution including all technical aspects.<BR>2. Circuit miniaturization. - Respond with technologies for reducing size and weight of the device.<BR>3. Information Assurance (IA) - Respond only with algorithms, methods and device solutions for implementing cryptographic requirements.<BR><BR>Technical objectives: This section enumerates the high-level functional capabilities for SDDL. The contemplated SDDL would provide the ground combatant Soldier a NLOS day/night all weather capable secure data link for control and sensor data for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions. SDDL provide secure uplink and downlink real time full motion downlink video between the GCS and munitions by means of digital data link.<BR><BR>SDDL will provide at least two frequency bands that will be used to transmit and receive data from a ground control station. Transmit and receive circuitry should be modular to allow for future frequency bands. Power requirements for the system must be less than 5W while transmitting. Transmit and receive range will be greater than 5KM including environmental effects. <BR><BR>A significant reduction in circuit size and weight beyond current fielded units shall be achieved. Advanced materials and processes may be used to achieve the desired size and weight. Total volume of all components must be less than 2 cubic inches. Total weight of SDDL shall be less than 2 oz.<BR><BR>The IA portion of the SDDL solution requires the link to include a method to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining control of the SDDL platform and ensures that uplink commands and downlink video in the channel is secure. The IA solution includes NSA Certified Type 1 encryption for all control and video traffic, encryption keying scheme, and node authentication system.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those top level requirements enumerated above. To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. <BR>Responses: To assist in research associated with the potential development of a SDDL for small unmanned aerial systems and munitions, the government is requesting information from industry. Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 20 pages and no smaller than 12pt Times New Roman font. Responses may include multiple concept submittals. The government encourages creativity in responses to this RFI. The white paper should include the following: (1) A brief description of one or more conceptual alternatives for the SDDL including associated components, (2) An overall feasibility assessment of each alternative and how each meets the objectives stated above. (3) A candidate high-level implementation roadmap that includes transition points, (4) SDDL cost drivers and cost tradeoffs and a preliminary cost estimate for each of the alternatives should be provided to include research and development costs, and cost per system for quantities of 500, 2000, and 20,000 SDDL systems, (5), A high-level risk assessment for each alternative that articulates the respondent's understanding of associated risks and risk mitigation approaches, (6) An estimate of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of components and the power system as a whole, (7) An estimate of SDDL production lead times and delivery schedules for the quantities listed above, (8) A brief description of any projects that the respondent's company is or has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI. This should include any relevant lessons learned, (9) Any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent. <BR>The objective of this process is to assess current and future products and technologies capable of achieving the stated SDDL objectives. <BR><BR>After RFI release, there will be a period of 15 calendar days for question submittal. Questions may be submitted to Michael Garner via email at michael.garnerjr@us.army.mil. All questions must be submitted in writing and reference the RFI number no later than 3:00 CST on 16 March 2011; telephone request for additional information will not be honored.

<p>BACKGROUND: This position is located in the U.S. Embassy, Narcotics Affairs Section - Central America (NAS-CA), Aviation Support Program (ASP) Office, Guatemala City, Guatemala. ASP provides planning, operational and logistical support and contract oversight for the NAS counter-narcotics/terrorism (CNT) aviation support program. The ASP performs this mission using a fleet of four rotary wing aircraft based in Guatemala. The ASP is responsible for assisting the curtailment of the supply of illegal drugs from foreign sources into the United States through support for the eradication of drug crops, interdiction of refining laboratories and trafficking activities, and other enforcement operations as directed by the NAS Director.</p>

<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>Domestically, the work is principally sedentary. While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required. Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>II. Minimum Qualifications</p>
<p>&bull; U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.<br />&bull; Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs. One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. <br />&bull; Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.<br />&bull; Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.<br />&bull; Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.<br />&bull; Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. <br />&bull; Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications. Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.</p>
<p>III. POSITION ELEMENTS</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs. The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.</p>
<p>Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL. The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.</p>
<p>IV. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>A. Knowledge of the concepts, principles, practices, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations as they relate to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.<br />20 points x ____ = _____</p>
<p>B. Experience in working with architecture and engineering firms, and other private consulting firms as appropriate, in order to determine project needs and to determine, define, and/or document program requirements and to manage project from inception to completion.<br />20 points x _____ = ______</p>
<p>C. Comprehensive understanding of contract administration principles, policies, regulations and procedures, including U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedure.<br />20 points x ____ = _____</p>

<p><br />V. COMPENSATION</p>
<p>Compensation for the position will be negotiated as follows: Level of experience will dictate the salary level within the grade range. Entry level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position. However, consideration will be given to the successful applicant's experience that is specifically relevant to the position to be filled. Number of years of relevant experience will determine at what step within the grade range the successful applicant will be compensated. Relocation expenses may be paid.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Super Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) will be the contracting vehicle used to implement building efficiency projects at Army Reserve facilities in the Northeast region (99th RSC). These facilities are located in 173 towns and cities across 13 states of the northeast region of the United States with a total square footage of 6.5M. The typical configuration at each of these installations is an administrative or office type facility and a vehicle maintenance facility. The customer would like to attain maximum facility energy savings - within the ESPC framework - through a comprehensive, holistic analysis of building efficiency measures. The intent is to optimize the combination of conservation measures (with various levels of cost and savings) to achieve more substantial energy savings within a given facility. In achieving their energy goals, the 99th RCS is interested in any of the energy conservation measures (ECM) defined in Attachment J-3 of the basic DOE IDIQ ESPC contract along with any operational improvements to meet their energy goals. The two main considerations of this ESPC will be to: (1) execute the project at a large number of locations that are geographically separated, (2) achieve a holistic, comprehensive analysis that produces the maximum energy savings per square foot of the modified facility.

<DESC>Summary: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of the anticipated acquisition of the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture (AF) Program and Agency support for law enforcement related investigations (Solicitation No. DJJE-10-RFP-0662). This requirement will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for nationwide support services to support the Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS). Approximately 1,425 contractor personnel will provide clerical, analytical, legal, and administrative support at approximately 490 various DOJ offices around the country that are responsible for the administration of Federal Asset Forfeiture programs. At any given time, 2 -3% of the aforementioned positions may be part-time, the rest are full-time. It is anticipated that some contractor personnel will need access to Classified Information to perform the duties associated with this requirement. As such, respondents need to have a facility clearance that enables them to process secret and top secret clearances.
<p>The purpose of this request for information is twofold: first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to get industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW). Through this Request for Information, the DOJ is requesting the capabilities and past performance of small business contractors interested in providing these services across DOJ Programs. Interested small business contractors including Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned, 8(a)'s, HUBZones, Veteran-Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. In addition, the DOJ is requesting comments on the draft SOW from both large and small businesses.</p>
<p>The Department is contemplating award of a single IDIQ contract and, based on responses to this Request for Information, will be able to determine the appropriateness of small business participation.</p>
<p>Background: The Draft SOW for this requirement is at Attachment A, the Labor Category Descriptions are at Attachment B, the Work Center Descriptions are at Attachment C and the Locations where contract support is currently required are at Attachment D. This Request for Information is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this synopsis.</p>
<p>Instructions for All Businesses: Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments and suggestions related to the draft Statement of Work, Labor Categories, Work Center Descriptions and Work Locations. Please submit response in Microsoft Word or PDF format. All information submitted should consist of UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL only.

<p>Further instructions for Small Businesses: In addition to comments and suggestions to the draft items listed above, small business respondents shall include the information required in items 1-5 below. Please submit response in Microsoft Word or PDF format. All information submitted should consist of UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL ONLY. Any company proprietary information must be marked as such. Information should not exceed ten (10) one-sided 8 &frac12; x 11 pages, with one inch margins, and font no smaller than 12 point. This brings the total page limitation for small businesses to fifteen (15) one-sided 81/2 11 pages (including the five (5) pages of comments as referenced above).</p>
<p>Item 1. Company name, address, telephone number, a point of contact with e-mail address, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Framework for Enhancing Veteran Policy Analysis Capability
Statement of Objectives (SOO)
I. Background

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to better integrate policy development and strategic planning department-wide.  It is looking to create a strategic framework to facilitate improved policy analysis, development and decision making.  Currently, there is limited analysis of the interrelationships of policies and planning decisions across VA programs, administrations, business lines and offices.  VA policy and planning decisions are sometimes not collaborated with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Often, neither the short- or long-term budgetary implications of policy and planning decisions are assessed before implementation.  Without broad perspective and input, barriers to policy implementation may arise limiting the positive results for veterans.  

Unlike the fields of defense or health policy analysis, there is not a well developed, objective, non-partisan veteran policy analysis community of practice available to support VA.  The absence of a veteran policy analysis community of practice limits VA's ability to draw upon outside expertise to enhance its policy development and decision making process.  The VA has limited opportunity to seek and receive broad-based, high-level advice from recognized experts on major veteran policy issues, and assess the impact of policies on veterans and VA programs.  

A robust veteran policy analysis community of practice can help the VA integrate and assess the impact various policy options will have on all VA-related organizations, partnering Departments, support organizations and veterans.  VA is considering the merits of establishing a high-level advisory policy forum that would contribute to establishing the community of veteran policy analysis.  This advisory forum would also enhance the VA's capacity to conduct integrated policy analyses and make decisions to achieve VA's strategy, goals, and vision.
II. Objective

The objective's of this Statement of Objectives (SOO) are to: (1) establish a high-level policy forum that improves VA's policy analysis, development and decision making process; (2) encourage establishment of a veteran policy analysis community of practice, and (3) define a strategic framework for VA to better integrate policy development and strategic planning department-wide.
III. Scope of Work

The scope of this SOO is to cover all activities to achieve these objectives.  This effort must take into account the interrelationships of policies across the various VA programs, administrations, and offices, as well as policy impacts on partnering Departments, support organizations and veterans.  In addition, both short and long-term impacts on mandatory and discretionary budget expenditures must be thoroughly assessed and incorporated into the strategic framework.
IV. Description of Tasks

Task 1 - Task Order Management

Sub-Task 1.1 - Post-Award Kickoff Meeting
No later than 15 days after award, the CONTRACTOR shall participate in a post-award kickoff meeting.  The meeting will serve as the means to provide the CONTRACTOR with details regarding the SOO, the interrelationships among tasks and subtasks, deliverables, and to support the development of the initial project work plan.  The kickoff meeting shall review task coordination details, e.g., meeting schedules and topics, deliverable review and issue resolution processes, preferred communication mechanisms (e.g., telephone, e-mail), and discuss procedures for obtaining and returning Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Government Furnished Information (GFI), if provided.

Deliverable 1: Summary of kickoff meeting

Sub-Task 1.2 - Project Work Plan and Reporting
No later than 30 days after award, the CONTRACTOR shall provide a Project Work Plan that will be used to manage and oversee the work to be accomplished.  The government will approve the project work plan or provide comments for revision within ten (10) business days of delivery.  The project work plan may be revised as needed, throughout the period of performance to accommodate changing priorities and work requirements.  Updates will be scheduled as mutually agreed between the government and the CONTRACTOR.  If updates to the work plan result in an adjustment, upward or downward, in the estimated resources to perform the work, the CONTRACTOR shall advise the government of such impact at the time the plan is submitted.

Deliverable 2: Project Work Plan

The CONTRACTOR shall provide a progress report on a monthly basis.  This report shall describe the accomplishments for the month (activities and deliverables), anticipated activities and deliverables for the following month, and any risks or issues identified during the month.  The progress report and the Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, SF 1034, shall be submitted concurrently with the progress report to the maximum extent practicable.

Deliverable 3: Monthly progress reports

Task 2 - Establish a Veteran Policy Forum (VPF)
The CONTRACTOR will develop a proposal and business case for a veteran policy forum (VPF) that enables the Secretary to receive advice from external experts.  This forum will expand on informal meetings that may have taken place and accomplish a similar function as the Defense Policy Board, but may be structured differently.

Sub-Task 2.1 - Define a Concept and Business Case Analysis for a Veteran Policy Forum
The CONTRACTOR will develop a concept and business case for a new VPF by forming a Technical Expert Panel (TEP).  The CONTRACTOR will consult with the Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) in developing the criteria and qualifications to be used in identifying and selecting candidates that would be appropriate for the TEP and the CONTRACTOR will propose a list of potential members. 

The CONTRACTOR will analyze the application of the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and identify advantages and disadvantages of an advisory committee subject to FACA.  Regardless of whether the VPF is subject to FACA, or takes on a different character and role, the CONTRACTOR will make recommendations as to the qualifications and composition of such an advisory component, and how it would enhance the overall department-wide policy development and strategic planning processes.  

Deliverable 4:  Concept and business case analysis for a veteran policy forum

Sub-Task 2.3 - Inaugural Support of a Veteran Policy Forum
If the proposal and business case analysis is accepted, the CONTRACTOR will support initial establishment and inaugural meeting of the VPF.

Deliverable 5:  Summary of inaugural meeting of the veteran policy forum

Task 3 - Defining the Community of Practice for Veteran Policy Analysis
The area of veteran policy analysis has not received the attention that other communities-such as defense and health policy analysis-have received.  Therefore, there is a need to define and develop the community of practice of veteran policy analysis. 

Sub-Task 3.1 - Identify Applicable Policy Analysis Frameworks
The CONTRACTOR will conduct an environmental scan to identify and analyze existing policy analysis frameworks used by governments, organizations, and academia in fields similar to veteran issues.  In particular, the CONTRACTOR will look at agencies such as Department of Defense, Social Security Administration, and Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the CONTRACTOR will explore the extent to which veteran policy analysis exists in other countries and the frameworks, if there are any, used in these countries.  

Sub-Task 3.2 - Assess Policy Analysis in the Current VA Strategic Management Process
Using the policy analysis frameworks identified from other sources, the CONTRACTOR will assess policy analysis capabilities within the current VA Strategic Management Process.  To understand the role existing veteran policy analysis plays in current VA policy development and strategic planning, the CONTRACTOR will analyze the existing VA strategic management process by interviewing appropriate VA staff and representatives, as well as review VA documents describing the Strategic Management Process.  The CONTRACTOR will summarize the VA's current capacity to conduct veteran policy analyses, and conduct a gap analysis comparing the current capacity to the capabilities identified in the veteran policy analysis frameworks.  

Deliverable 6:  Summary of veteran policy frameworks and assessment of current VA policy analysis capacity 

Task 4 - Develop a Strategy for Enhancing Veteran Policy Analysis in VA
Based on the review from Task 3, the CONTRACTOR will make recommendations for a future policy analysis framework that will help reshape future VA policy development.  The framework should address the current strategic planning processes - identifying changes required to improve policy analysis and development.  This framework must be compatible with current processes to provide opportunities for immediate impact.  The CONTRACTOR will develop a strategy for enhancing the capacity and capabilities to conduct veteran policy analysis within the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This strategy will describe options to enhance the VA's capacity and capabilities for veteran policy analyses to narrow or close any identified gaps.  

The CONTRACTOR will develop and test the proposed framework by conceptually applying it to a small number of veterans' issues to assess how well it works.  The purpose of doing this is to see how the framework works and where and how it needs refinement.  The CONTRACTOR, in consultation with VA, will identify various significant issues facing veterans' policy issues to run through the proposed conceptual framework.

The CONTRACTOR will include an analysis of current VA policies, practices, organization, as well as capacity and capabilities relative to the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) needed to effectively implement the proposed framework.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase to the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requires the services of Data Cleaning and analysis of big game harvest data collected.
Background/History: Harvest data of wildlife species is currently only collected state-wide by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG).  However, the Council of Athabasca Tribal Government's (CATG) has been collecting harvest data on the Refuge under contract to the Refuge since 2001.  These data are not comparable to other data sets collected state-wide by ADFG use to the use of different protocols for data collection and data analysis.  This devalues Refuge harvest data sets by making them incomparable to other data sets in other Alaska regions.  CATG is currently adopting ADFG protocols to collect, analyze, and summarize harvest data but are in the middle of an employee  transition and are not capable, at this time, to provide adequate harvest data cleaning and analysis up to refuge standards.
Scope: We wish to establish a contract with ADFG to provide data cleaning and analysis for big game harvest data that has been collected by CATG.  This contract will ensure that data products derived from this particular data set are of high quality.  The ADFG will train CATG on proper protocols for harvest data cleaning and analysis. This will ensure a successful transition in protocol adoption for CATG which will be of direct benefit to the Refuge in the future.   In other words, in future contracts the work will be done directly by CATG under a contract from the Refuge.
Deliverables: Big game harvest data will be cleaned, analyzed and summarized into a summary report.  The summary report and a copy of the Excel spreadsheet or Access database will be sent to the Refuge by mid May 2011.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies and services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service, Conservation Biology Division on a sole source basis with University of Washington. The government intends to acquire supplies and services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. A key part of this project is the estimation of the transport of watershed-based nutrients and pathogens to shellfish growing areas under alternative climate, marine, and watershed conditions. Loading estimates from existing NWFSC climate-watershed modeling studies will provide inputs to an oceanographic model of Puget Sound to calculate the transport of river-derived nutrients and pathogens. The watershed-based loadings will represent a range of land-use and future-climate scenarios. The oceanographic modeling also will generate spatial distributions of biophysical attributes (e.g., temperature, salinity, DO) that will be used to predict occurrence of marine pathogens in shellfish growing areas. Specifically, the vendor will provide the following services to assist in addressing the objectives of this project:Model marine transport of the following: a. Watershed-based pathogens: For each climate and watershed-loading scenario, tracers representing pathogen concentration will be added through freshwater inputs and tracked over an annual cycle throughout the Sound. This pathogen transport will be summarized as a map (at 200 m scale) of mean pathogen concentration; b.Watershed-based nutrient loadings: Transport of watershed-based nutrient loading will be treated similarly to terrestrial pathogens, as a variable concentration tracer introduced with freshwater, which is tracked and mapped over an annual cycle and c. Marine pathogens: The model will be used to generate fields of environmental variables, most notably surface temperature that existing data show to be predictive of Vibrio risk. These will serve as inputs to a data-driven model of Vibrio constructed by scientists at the NWFSC. The UW Team is uniquely qualified to conduct this work in three ways: 1.) they have developed a model, MoSSea (Modeling the Salish Sea), that is capable of providing realistic simulations of physical circulation in the entire Salish Sea Region, which encompasses Puget Sound; 3.) They have experience validating the model with observation data as well as applying this and previous versions of the model in several case studies and 3.) Future climate-forcing scenarios for the Pacific Northwest are already being coupled to the MoSSea model, and being tested using data from the 2000s. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract, with period of performance commencing approximately from date of award through Sept 30, 2012. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. It is the Government's belief that only University of Washington can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition. ****The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are required to complete online Representations and Certifications at http://www.orca.bpn.gov to be eligible to receive an award.

<SOLNBR>SpecialNotice3-1-2011
<RESPDATE>031611
<CONTACT>Andrew Flynn, Contract Specialist, Email flynn.andrew@epa.gov
<DESC><p>EPA intends to award a six-month extension to a current contract, EP-D-06-118 with Research Triangle Institute (RTI), Research Triangle Park, NC, on a sole source basis. The current contract was previously competitively awarded and is to expire 3/31/11. A follow-on competitive procurement is in process, however, will not be awarded before EP-D-06-118 expires. The contract is currently in its Option IV period, which includes 10,000 base hours and fifteen (15) 2,000-hour increments. The six-month extension will require an estimated 32,000 hours of additional effort than what was previously negotiated.</p>
<p>The program office relies on this contract to provide support for source specific regulatory programs. The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for major and area sources residual risk standards, as well as other standards development activities. EPA has completed the last set of MACT standards under section 112(d). These standards regulate emissions primarily from major stationary sources. Section 112(k) requires the development of standards for area sources which account for 90% of the emissions in urban areas of the 33 urban hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) listed in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy. In addition to developing standards that regulate the emissions of air toxics from stationary sources, the program office is responsible for developing stationary source criteria pollutant standards. Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court-ordered deadlines. Many of these deadlines will occur within the next 12 months, which require contractor support well in advance of those deadlines.</p>
<p>RTI has been providing support for these programs since Contract EP-D-06-118 was awarded in 2006. They are uniquely qualified to provide the additional six-month effort because timing is critical and no other contractor would acquire the knowledge and expertise pertaining to the regulatory sectors in the time frame that is required.</p>
<p><br />No Request for Proposal is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Andrew Flynn at flynn.andrew@epa.gov for consideration by the Agency. Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, the contract with Research Triangle Institute will be extended by a six-month period.</p>

The effort is to continue support of Coalition MobilitySystem (CMS) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD). The Governmentis currently transitioning CMS from a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration(JCTD) to a USTRANSCOM Program of Record (POR).  The contractor shall addressall security requirements of the USTRANSCOM POR and provide input to PORrequired documents.

Eventually, the JCTDservers will be turned off, and the maintenance called for in the SSC PACcontract will no longer be required.  The remaining equipment will then betransferred to the POR and a project post-mortem will be conducted.  The SSCPAC contract will then be complete.Contract N66001-08-C-0139 period of performance will be extended 3 months (fromthe current end date of 31 March 2011 to 30 June 2011) with the considerationof an additional 3 months (from the current end date of 31 March 2011 to 30September 2011) as deemed necessary by the Government.The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends tosolicit and negotiate with only one source.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2FORESTPRK is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 3-6 March 2011 in the Forest Park, GA area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. <BR>Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5 M to $30 M.  All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract. Offerors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified. Award shall be made to a single offeror. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.<BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. FAILURE TO SUBMIT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A REJECTED BID DUE TO NON-RESPONSIVENESS:<BR><BR>a) a list of three (3) references for a similar stay. References shall include; name/point of contact, address, phone number, and Email address<BR>b) a list of facility amenities<BR>c) pricing, CAGE code, DUNS number, and Federal Tax ID<BR>d) a statement confirming that your company is registered in ORCA or a copy of your company`s Representations and Certifications completely filled out<BR>e) For third party vendors, your quote shall include the additional information requested in the paragraph listed below. Failure to provide this information with your quote may deem your quote to be technically unacceptable and/or non-responsive.<BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offerors services as a prime contractor and forward a copy of a signed, written agreement between the offeror and a representative who has binding authority of stated hotel facility. This agreement must state that it covers the period of performance requested in the solicitation and be signed by both parties. In addition, a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) must be submitted with the offerors technical proposal for evaluation purposes.

<CONTACT>Kristopher A Lemaster, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882995, Fax 7704882670, Email klemaster@cdc.gov - Vivian S Hubbs, Team Lead, Phone (770) 488-2647, Fax (770) 488-2670, Email vhubbs@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>This is for informational purposes only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with JAKA Consulting Group of Reston, Virginia to to identify, contact, and secure endorsements from athletes with the intention of improving response rates, particularly among NHANES 12-19 year old male participants.<br />The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has conducted the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) continuously since 1999. NHANES is conducted by the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (DHNES). NHANES surveys individuals in fifteen primary sampling units (e.g., a county) each year. These individuals participate in an extensive questionnaire and physical exam. The study concentrates on physical activity and fitness, diet and nutrition, chemical and environmental exposures, infectious diseases, mental health, oral health, and many other medical conditions.<br />In each county that NHANES visits outreach efforts are made to obtain respondent participation. These include endorsements from well-known individuals and organizations in local government, academia and the allied health fields. However, many respondents are less interested in these endorsements than in endorsements from well-known people such as athletes. For example, in Hispanic HANES (1982-1984), Fernando Valenzuela, then pitcher for the los Angeles Dodgers, gave an endorsement, including his picture on a poster which was used to promote the survey. By all accounts the endorsement was successful in terms of increasing visibility and credibility of the health survey, and was viewed as having positively impacted response.</p>
<p>This project will consist of a pilot and an extended phase. The pilot phase (PP) will be conducted in a primary sampling unit (PSU) local to the NCHS Hyattsville office. The outcomes of this effort will be: 1) endorsements from one or more professional athletes, and 2) a qualitative assessment of the ability to get athlete's NHANES endorsements.<br />If NCHS determines the PP to be successful the extended phase will be executed. The purpose of the extended phase (EP) is to identify, contact, and secure endorsements from athletes with the intention of improving response rates, particularly among NHANES 12-19 year old male participants. If the EP is executed, four other PSUs will be identified.</p>
<p>Due diligence by the government has shown that JAKA Consulting Group (JCG), a minority owned, self-certified small disadvantaged business is uniquely qualified for this pilot project. JCG President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ken Harvey, is a former National Football League (NFL) player, a past president of the Washington Redskins Football Alumni Association, and is currently the Director of Responsibility for Washington Redskins Football. Consequently, JCG is uniquely able to help NHANES select athletes for endorsements. To accomplish the objectives of this project the government will utilize JCG's knowledge, experience, and relationships to contact and secure athlete's NHANES endorsements.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541613. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this notice or by submitting a response. This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals. The government believes the services provided by JCG meet the minimum needs of the Government and no other source for these services is known at this time. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies are services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Information furnished shall include enough detail information to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation. Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results. Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor responses will be considered non-responsive. The receipt of responses shall be within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis...instead of forty-five days.<br />Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer: Kristopher Lemaster, Phone 770-488-2995, email Klemaster@cdc.gov. If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please call the Team Leader, Vivian Hubbs.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOTFOC)</p>
<p>A. Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition".<br />i. USCG C3CEN is the requesting agency and the contracting activity.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />i. Support and upgrade renewal for Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI) software.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.<br />i. The C3CEN Common Operation Picture (COP) project utilizes AGI software for development and support of the COP Web Services Subsystem (CWSS). This requirement is for the support, upgrades, library license renewal of AGI's Satellite Tool Kit, Terrain Analysis, Spatial Analysis, AGI Viewer and Dynamic Geometry software. This purchase can be obtained from AGI with an estimated cost of $66K.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.<br />i. 6.302-1(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />i. The AGI software is currently being used by the CWSS project. AGI is the only source available to provide license renewal and support for AGI products.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.<br />i. Requirement shall be posted OEM Specific since this procurement is for continued development of CWSS which utilizes AGI software.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />i. Compared to previous acquisitions for similar purchases, the cost to the Government is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. <br />i. Market research was conducted using various methods. The software manufacturer, AGI, was contacted to verify whether they were able to meet the Governments needs. Additionally, internet searches were done for other vendors who could also fulfill this requirement. No other vendors were found.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:<br />i. Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. <br />a) N/A<br />ii. When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. <br />a) The cost for this procurement would require the initial purchase of this type of software, plus any license fees. The initial software procurement was approximately $500K. In addition to the software purchase, extensive re-engineering of the CWSS system would be required. This would result in additional labor hours and potential delays in providing COP services to the Coast Guard. The estimated cost for these engineering services would be at least $300-400K. <br />iii. When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.<br />a) N/A</p>
<p>10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />i. None at this time. This requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.<br />i. None at this time.</p>
<p>12. Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>B. Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).

An LPTA evaluation will be performed for each of the 2 CLINs. Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the lowest evaluated price.
 Information submitted by the offeror must sufficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the services specified above. Quoters are not required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.





Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
 APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.

The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Questions pertaining to 2011 U.S. Strategic Command Deterrence Symposium </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. We want to avoid being financially responsible for the catering contract (we prefer our clients sign vendor contracts), can you please clarify the statement under Catering, "Contractor will accept all financial responsibility for payment to catering service?". We suggest collecting all conference fees and then handing all revenues after any refunds or adjustments are made to our client, at which time they can pay for all support services such as the caterer. Under this contract is the successful contractor expected to pay catering upfront and be reimbursed?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The government will not sign a contract for catering service. Yes, successful contractor is expected to pay catering upfront with registration fees they have received.</p>
<p><strong>2. Would your organization like to have the ability to update content themselves (have the capability of having multiple users do this)?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: We would like the ability for a couple personnel to view information.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. When we submit our quotes do we include the meeting space and meals into the final numbers or will the agency pay for the meeting space separately?</strong></p>
<p><br />Answer: the government will contract for the venue.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4. I have a question about this solicitation. All of the information needed to complete the web page requirements would need to come from you. When will that information be provided? The section of the solicitation in question is listed below.<br /><br /></strong>Sec 8<br />Contracted Event Planner Responsibilities a. Create and maintain a DS 2011 event website with the following pages: <br />&bull; Event summary<br />&bull; Event agenda<br />&bull; Speaker/panelist biographies<br />&bull; Event registration<br />&bull; Event lodging information and links<br />&bull; "Things to do in Omaha" links<br />&bull; STRATCOM Event staff contact listing<br />&bull; Prior year's event summaries with link to USSTRATCOM video webpage &bull; Information on who to contact for event questions (STRATCOM) and registration system problems (contracted event planner)</p>
<p>Answer: STRATCOM will provide information needed to complete the web page requirements as soon as contract is awarded. Contractor in coordination with STRATCOM will create the design of website. Some of the information on the website will have to be updated periodically.</p>
<p><strong>Questions pertaining to 2011 U.S. Strategic Command Deterrence Symposium </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.Was there an incumbent for the two previous meetings and what were their names? </strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, there was no incumbent for the two previous Deterrence Symposiums.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.Assuming an event planner was contracted to assist with the 2010 STRATCOM conference, what was the contract amount?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No event planner was used for the 2010 USSTRATCOM Deterrence Symposium.</p>
<p><strong>3.Are contractors to assume the government contracts with the venue?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the government will contract for the venue.</p>
<p><strong>4.Does the government determine all food and beverage selections?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The government will coordinate with the event planning contractor and the event planner will contract with the venue caterer.</p>
<p><br /><strong>5.Does the government determine food and beverage prices based on 500, 650 or 700 registrants?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The government will set the registration fee and it is solely based on food and beverage costs.</p>
<p><br /><strong>6.Is the registration fee based solely on food and beverage costs and does the government set the fee?<br /><br /></strong>Answer: Yes, the government will set the registration fee and it is solely based on food and beverage costs.</p>
<p><strong>7.If the registration fee is based upon an agreed number of attendees (500, 650 or 700) but the actual number exceeds that anticipated, how is the contractor to be compensated for the overage as it has contracted with the conference center caterer for a smaller amount?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Each symposium registrant will pay a registration fee that is to cover the cost of meals. In the past we have worked with the venue caterer and kept them updated on our expected numbers, seven days prior to the event we were able to give the caterer and updated numbers, and then we updated the caterer on the day of event with last minute changes.</p>
<p><br /><strong>8.Are contractors to assume food and beverage costs are not to be included in the contractor's price proposal?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: That is correct, food and beverages costs are not to be included in the contractor's price proposal.</p>
<p><br /><strong>9.What were the registration fees for the two previous conferences and for how many attendees?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Registration fee for 2009 was $150.00 and had 492 attendees. The registration fee for 2010 was $165.00 and we had 642 attendees.</p>
<p><br /><strong>10.Does the government require a specific domain name (e.g., DS2011.com) or can its website be added to an existing website (companyname.com/DS2011)?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The government would require a specific domain name.</p>
<p><strong>11.Is there an existing website that was used for past symposiums?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, it no longer exists.</p>

<CONTACT>Matthew R. Dittmer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4057395197, Email matthew.dittmer@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>Three questions asked. Answers provided.
<p>For questions 1 &amp; 2:</p>
<p>1. What is the bolted tonnage and/or GPM circulation rates for each<br />cooling tower? <br />2. What is the estimated volume of each closed chill loop?</p>
<p>Appendix A-1 and Appendix A-2</p>
<p>No 1 (both Appendices) Note: As stated in the appendices, this system was<br />"separated" into two documents (on paper only) for budgetary reasons; in<br />actuality, this is a single system, and supports the single function of<br />providing cooling water to air compressors; historical/estimated chemical<br />usage for this system is the total amount shown in both appendices.</p>
<p>This system consists of a three (3) cell Cooling Tower OC11516,<br />OC11517, and OC11518, manufactured by Marley (Quadraflow M/N: 23203 and S/N:<br />085290), and were purchased/installed circa 1995. Per manufacturer's<br />literature, the cooling tower system is rated for 2000 tons nominal. All 3<br />cells share a common basin, located adjacently, consisting of an in-ground<br />concrete enclosure which holds approximately 15,000 gallons water. Each<br />cell possesses a two-speed up-flow fan, each of which cycles off-low-high<br />based on demand. Water flows continuously through all three (3) tower<br />cells.<br />This open loop system operates as follows: water is pumped from the basin,<br />runs to the air compressors (heat load), runs to the cooling towers, and<br />returns back to the common basin. There are 4 motorpumps continuously<br />flowing water through the towers (and air compressors) for a maximum<br />approximate total flow of 4,000 GPM. The (roughly) estimated total cooling<br />water volume for this open loop system is circa 20,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Appendix A-3</p>
<p>No 1, No 2, and No 3</p>
<p>This system consists of two (2) each identical Fluid Coolers (a.k.a.<br />Closed Circuit Cooling Towers) OC17692 and OC16520, both manufactured by<br />Baltimore Air Coil (M/N: FXV-364-31R, S/N's: U053394501 and U053394503), and<br />were purchased/installed circa 1995. Per manufacturer's literature, each<br />fluid cooler is rated for 579 tons nominal. Each fluid cooler possesses an<br />independent basin (integral to each fluid cooler) for spraybar water; each<br />cooler's basin holds/maintains approximately 2700 gallons of water. Note<br />that each fluid cooler possesses two (2) coils and two (2) spraybar<br />motorpumps (one spraybar motorpump per coil), with a single VFD controlled<br />up-flow fan. The fluid coolers are operated in a lead/lag configuration,<br />alternated weekly. The fluid coolers, spraybar motorpumps, and VFD fan come<br />on and offline per demand. Except for a few weeks during the summer months,<br />one fluid cooler can typically handle the entire cooling load.<br />The closed loop portion of this system operates as follows: water<br />from a "hot" reservoir tank is pumped to each fluid cooler (one motorpump<br />per fluid cooler), runs through the fluid cooler coils, and returns to a<br />"cold" reservoir tank. Then the water from the "cold" reservoir tank is<br />pumped (using a separate set of motorpumps) to the vacuum furnaces (heat<br />load), and is then returned back to the "hot" reservoir tank. The motorpump<br />to the vacuum furnaces continuously flows approximately 2500 GPM. The<br />motorpump to each fluid cooler flows approximately 1400 GPM, so with both<br />fluid coolers in use, the flow through both fluid coolers is approximately<br />2800 GPM total. The (roughly) estimated total cooling water volume for this<br />closed loop system is circa 20,000 gallons.</p>
<p>No 4 and No 5</p>
<p>This system consists of one (1) each Fluid Cooler OC13887,<br />manufactured by Recold (M/N: JWH-115C, S/N: 991006), and was<br />purchased/installed circa 2000. Per the manufacturer and literature, the<br />fluid cooler is rated for 175 tons nominal. The fluid cooler possesses a<br />basin (integral to the fluid cooler unit) for spraybar water; the basin<br />holds/maintains approximately 880 gallons of water. This fluid cooler uses<br />a single spraybar motorpump and single cross-flow fan. The fluid cooler<br />spraybar motorpump and fan come on and offline per demand.<br />The closed loop portion of this system operates as follows:<br />water/glycol solution (30% glycol) from the reservoir tank is pumped to the<br />fluid cooler, runs through the fluid cooler coil, then runs to the vacuum<br />furnaces (heat load), and returns back to the same tank. The motorpumps to<br />the fluid cooler (and furnaces) continuously flows approximately 1000 GPM.<br />The total glycol/water solution volume is estimated at 4,500 gallons.</p>
<p>No 6</p>
<p>This small, closed loop system does not utilize a fluid cooler or<br />cooling tower, but obtains its cooling action from a shell and tube heat<br />exchanger tied-in to the Base Supplied chilled water loop. The system was<br />manufactured from both new and used components, and was installed circa<br />2003.<br />This system operates as follows: water from the reservoir tank is<br />pumped through the tube side heat exchanger (chilled water on the shell<br />side), and is returned back to the tank. Then separate motorpump(s) pull<br />water from the same reservoir tank, runs to the Polycolds (heat load), and<br />is returned back to the tank. The motorpump to the Polycolds continuously<br />flows between 50 - 100 GPM. The cooling water flow through the (tube side)<br />of the heat exchanger is a maximum 120 GPM; the chilled water flow through<br />the (shell side) of the heat exchanger is a maximum 50 GPM. The total<br />cooling water system fluid volume is circa 1000 gallons.</p>
<p>For Question #3:</p>
<p>3. Do Tinker AFB personnel desire testing equipment for their own use?</p>
<p>We do little in-house testing of these systems...basically none on any of<br />the B3001 systems (all in appendix A-3).<br />However, several of the mechanics do perform periodic testing on the system<br />located by Buildings 200/210 (appendix A-1 and A-2)..this is the cooling<br />water for the air compressors. However, these are relatively small field<br />test kits, and we just buy them...historically, we've purchased them<br />as-needed from the contract provider. In other words, when we need to<br />replenish our supply of test kits, we purchase them, and the contract<br />provider is NOT expected to pay for or provide them to us as part of this<br />service contract. On the relatively rare occasion we'd need/want more<br />in-depth information on any of the fluids, we have laboratories here in<br />B3001 that possesses everything needed.</p>

The Government will accept the proposal that is in its best interest.<BR><BR>3.  The Government will provide the Contractor with two paper sets of plans.  The plans are not to scale and are for general guidance.  The Contractor shall return one set of plans with "as constructed" to note any field changes to the Government within 5 business days of completion of the project.<BR><BR>4.  An electronic copy of the plans is located at Technical Exhibit 2.  Potential bidders may obtain a paper copy of the plans by contacting Mr. Mike Houck, Biologist, at 785-239-2537.<BR><BR>5.  The Government will provide basic staking of the construction site based on the plans and on-site conditions at time of construction.<BR><BR>6.  The Contractor shall remove the existing metal culvert and install pre-cast box culverts following normal industry standards at the location noted on the plans and staked at the site.<BR><BR>7.  The Contractor shall insure the new pre-cast culverts are installed in a matter that does not alter the streambed gradient.  As per drawing, the Contractor shall set one or two culverts below the natural streambed gradient to allow for natural stream flow.  The finished installation shall allow fish passage and shall not back normal water flow upstream of the structure, shall not create any measurable plunge pool on the downstream side, and shall not create a pond or pooled situation over the face of the crossing.  The Contractor shall set the additional culverts above the lower culvert(s) level to handle high flow periods.<BR><BR>8.  The Contractor shall install a concrete cap above the lower culvert(s) that shall create a level surface over the entire culvert system. <BR><BR><BR>9.  The Contractor shall use any rock and soil material removed from the existing roadbed site to cover the culverts.  Road surface material will be removed and used to resurface the road after construction is completed.  If additional cover is required, the Government, working with the Contractor, will designate a borrow site near the construction site.<BR><BR>10.  The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an off-installation quarry.  <BR><BR>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<BR><BR>12.  The Contractor shall not conduct construction activities below the water's surface in Honey Creek during the Topeka shiner spawning period of May 15 to July 31. inclusive.  <BR><BR>13.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at least 10 days prior to construction. The COR is responsible for notifying the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Field Office  in advance of any activities which have the potential to affect any Topeka shiner habitat.<BR><BR>14.  The Contractor shall only install those roads and ramps necessary to install the pre-cast culverts.  The Contractor shall only reshape the channel is necessary to direct the natural flow to the culvert location.  The Contractor shall install erosion control structures as necessary to minimize downstream sedimentation during all activities.<BR><BR>15.  The Contractor shall clear only those trees, brush, and other debris necessary to install the culverts and access the streambed.  Trees, brush, and debris shall be piled in such a manner as not to obstruct stream flow nor block current access route.  <BR><BR>16.  The Contractor shall implement and maintain best management practices for erosion control throughout the duration of all project activities located in runoff areas to the stream.<BR><BR>17.  The Contractor shall provide seeding and/or mulching within all stream runoff areas as soon as grading allow, following the end of construction.<BR><BR>18.  The Contractor shall locate storage facilities for petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals so that discharge and runoff into stream is not possible.<BR><BR>19.  The Contractor shall make all efforts to complete all work in a timely manner so that traffic on roadway is not closed for extended periods of time.  The Contractor shall provide signage on roadway when road is closed during construction.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) when roadway is scheduled for closure.  <BR><BR>20.  The Contractor shall make all efforts not to block roadway when construction site is inactive.<BR><BR>21.  The Contractor shall coordinator with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to determine the dates available for construction.  Military training takes precedence over the work to be performed in this contract.  <BR><BR>22.  If prehistoric or historic archeological deposits or human remains are discovered during the course of this contract, the Contractor shall immediately suspend work.

<DESC>Section C<BR>Scope of Work<BR><BR>1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor and any necessary equipment to install Government furnished; pre-cast box culverts for a tank trail crossing over Honey Creek at Fort Riley, Kansas.  Technical Exhibit 1 indicates the project site.<BR><BR>2.  The Contractor shall submit two proposals for the project.  Proposal one shall be for the installation of pre-cast culverts delivered to the construction site prior to the project commencing.  Proposal two shall be for both the transportation of the pre-cast culverts from a location on Fort Riley approximately 13 miles from the construction site and the installation of the pre-cast culverts after transport.  The Government will accept the proposal that is in its best interest.<BR><BR>3.  The Government will provide the Contractor with two paper sets of plans.  The plans are not to scale and are for general guidance.  The Contractor shall return one set of plans with "as constructed" to note any field changes to the Government within 5 business days of completion of the project.<BR><BR>4.  An electronic copy of the plans is located at Technical Exhibit 2.  Potential bidders may obtain a paper copy of the plans by contacting Mr. Mike Houck, Biologist, at 785-239-2537.<BR><BR>5.  The Government will provide basic staking of the construction site based on the plans and on-site conditions at time of construction.<BR><BR>6.  The Contractor shall remove the existing metal culvert and install pre-cast box culverts following normal industry standards at the location noted on the plans and staked at the site.<BR><BR>7.  The Contractor shall insure the new pre-cast culverts are installed in a matter that does not alter the streambed gradient.  Culverts should be set on best available on-site material and compacted for firm base.  As per drawing, the Contractor shall set one or two culverts below the natural streambed gradient to allow for natural stream flow.  The finished installation shall allow fish passage and shall not back normal water flow upstream of the structure, shall not create any measurable plunge pool on the downstream side, and shall not create a pond or pooled situation over the face of the crossing.  The Contractor shall set the additional culverts above the lower culvert(s) level to handle high flow periods.<BR><BR>8.  The Contractor shall also install a concrete cap above the lower culverts that shall create a level surface over the entire culvert system. <BR><BR>9.  The Contractor shall use any rock and soil material removed from the existing roadbed site to cover the culverts.  Road surface material will be removed and used to resurface the road after construction is completed.  If additional cover is required, the Government, working with the Contractor, will designate a borrow site near the construction site.<BR><BR>10.  The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an on-installation quarry site designated by the government.  The Contractor will be responsible for loading and transporting rock from quarry site.<BR><BR>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<BR><BR>12.  The Contractor shall not conduct construction activities below the water's surface in Honey Creek during the Topeka shiner spawning period of May 15 to July 31. inclusive.  <BR><BR>13.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at least 10 days prior to construction. The COR is responsible for notifying the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Field Office  in advance of any activities which have the potential to affect any Topeka shiner habitat.<BR><BR>14.  The Contractor shall only install those roads and ramps necessary to install the pre-cast culverts.  The Contractor shall only reshape the channel is necessary to direct the natural flow to the culvert location.  The Contractor shall install erosion control structures as necessary to minimize downstream sedimentation during all activities.<BR><BR>15.  The Contractor shall clear only those trees, brush, and other debris necessary to install the culverts and access the streambed.  Trees, brush, and debris shall be piled in such a manner as not to obstruct stream flow nor block current access route.  <BR><BR>16.  The Contractor shall implement and maintain best management practices for erosion control throughout the duration of all project activities located in runoff areas to the stream.<BR><BR>17.  The Contractor shall provide seeding and/or mulching within all stream runoff areas as soon as grading allow, following the end of construction.<BR><BR>18.  The Contractor shall locate storage facilities for petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals so that discharge and runoff into stream is not possible.<BR><BR>19.  The Contractor shall make all efforts to complete all work in a timely manner so that traffic on roadway is not closed for extended periods of time.  The Contractor shall provide signage on roadway when road is closed during construction.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) when roadway is scheduled for closure.  <BR><BR>20.  The Contractor shall make all efforts not to block roadway when construction site is inactive.<BR><BR>21.  The Contractor shall coordinator with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to determine the dates available for construction.  Military training takes precedence over the work to be performed in this contract.  <BR><BR>22.  If prehistoric or historic archeological deposits or human remains are discovered during the course of this contract, the Contractor shall immediately suspend work.  The Cultural Resources Manager or his/her representative, Directorate of Public Work, notified as soon as possible.  The Fort Riley Cultural Resources Management Staff will evaluate the significance of the find and provide the Contracting Officer and COR guidance.  The Cultural Resources Manager can be reached at 785-239-3976/785-239-6211.<BR><BR>23.

Only remove trees necessary for excavation along ditch by culvert installation.<BR><BR>6)	Will the hardware be removed if contractor moves culvert?<BR>Are we to disassemble the existing storming shelter or will we be supplied with a new box culvert?<BR>Answer: No, contractor would be required to remove hardware before moving culvert.<BR><BR>7)	What is expected of the downstream area for rock/debris removal for stream flow?<BR>Answer: Clear the deposited rock/debris in natural stream bed. Excess material can be moved to the site designated by the CR within 1/4 mile of project site.<BR><BR>8)	Wondering about the proposal forms, two kinds that need to be submitted.  Is there a certain type of form?<BR>Answer: The proposal can be emailed or faxed from the information in #2a, and 2b there no certain form for this proposal, since there is one CLIN# being used.<BR><BR>9)	You are going to evaluate the proposals by price and CCASS ratings?<BR>Answer: Yes<BR><BR>10)	 The proposal did not need to contain any other information than the two proposals requested. In other words, you are not seeking additional past performance write ups, a warranty write up nor a technical approach?<BR>Answer: Correct no additional write-up is required.<BR><BR>11)	 CCASS ratings will be evaluated with "technical" rating higher than "warranty" and "warranty" rating higher than "past performance'?<BR>Answer: No, All areas will be evaluated as posted the order of importance has not been established.<BR><BR>12)	What are the dimensions of the supplied RCB sections, and who is the manufacturer?<BR>Answer:  6'x5' RCB  8' section length.  Manufacturer is Vanguard Precast.<BR><BR>13)	What is the weight of the supplied RCB sections, and is it a single cell or double cell. ?<BR>Answer:  Check with Vanguard Precast on weight.  These are single cell.<BR><BR>14)	What are the elevations of the roadway and streambed on the upstream and downstream sides of the culvert?  <BR>Answer:  Approximately 12-13 feet.<BR><BR>15)	Is the RCB to be backfilled with gravel, flow-able fill, or compacted job excavated material?   <BR>Answer: Use job excavated material.<BR><BR>16)	What does the existing metal culvert consist of?<BR>Answer:  The metal culvert is 8' in diameter and is approx. 72' long.<BR><BR>17)	After removal of the existing pipe, is bedding material required to level the trench prior to placement of the new concrete culvert? <BR>Answer:  Yes, a concrete bedding according to State Standards.<BR><BR>18)	The existing concrete culvert sections are currently sealed together with some type of adhesive. Upon installation, is the concrete culvert to be sealed with a similar adhesive? Are the RCB joints to be wrapped with Mac Wrap or an equal product? If so is it also supplied?<BR>Answer:  The RCB joints are to be sealed and wrapped with Mac Wrap or equal product.  Contractor is responsible for material.<BR><BR>19)	The current pipe is not perpendicular with the road and is on a skew. If the new culvert is laid on this same general line, one end of the culvert sections will be much closer to the shoulder than the other. Is the intent to stagger the ends of the culverts to maintain a constant distance from the shoulder?<BR>Answer:  Stagger the ends of the culverts to maintain a constant distance from the shoulder.<BR><BR><BR>20)	What is the existing road surface above the proposed culvert? Is the contractor responsible for the replacement?<BR>Answer:  The existing road surface is gravel and millings (asphalt).  After culvert installation the contractor should replace road surface using existing road material.<BR><BR>21)	Is the concrete cap required to include reinforcement?<BR>Answer:  yes<BR><BR>22)	It appears that there will be ample rock to place on the ends of the culverts from what is on-site. If not, what is the gradation requirement for this rock? <BR>Answer: Use same grad as existing road ditch slopes.<BR><BR>23)	Paragraph 14 and 16 discuss erosion control. Is an SWPPP plan required to be submitted prior to construction?<BR>Answer:  No SWPPP needed.<BR><BR>24)	Wondering about the proposal forms, two kinds that need to be submitted.  Is there a certain type of form?<BR>Answer: The proposal can be emailed or faxed from the information in #2a, and 2b there no certain form for this proposal, since there is one CLIN# being used.<BR><BR>Question Change-1<BR><BR>25)	What is the bidding for the stream the culvert will set on?<BR>What is the required bedding for the RCB, and/or is a seal course required?<BR>What type and how thick is the sub base requirement under the box culvert?<BR>Answer: The use of on-site material (similar to crushed rock) to form a firm bedding is sufficient.<BR><BR>26)	 I do not understand the answer to question 3 in the Q&A sent out. We have built many precast and cast-in-place RCB's for K-Dot. There are two options in the standard spec section 735, 6" crushed stone or 3" concrete seal course. The concrete seal course "mud slab" is generally used under cast-in-place boxes in wet conditions to ease cleaning of the base rebar if mud is washed in. The reference to "Concrete bedding w/toes" is not a K-dot standard. The toe walls would be constructed with aprons and wing walls which are not detailed or called out for on this project that I can find. The way I interpret par. 10 in the RFP is that riprap shall be installed on the culvert face (for toe wall) and adjacent slopes to reduce erosion.  <BR>Answer: According to PW engineers there is no need for concrete bedding w/toes for this project.  The use of on-site material (similar to crushed rock) to form a firm bedding is sufficient.<BR><BR>27)	We believe the wording "in accordance with K-dot standards" should give us the option for the 6" crushed stone bedding, and that riprap on the culvert face per the RFP would serve as a toe wall. <BR>Answer: The riprap can serve as the toe for this project.  <BR><BR>28)	I would also like to confirm where any extra large rock for channel erosion is to come from if needed, new from off-installation or  from the owners quarry west of the project?<BR>Answer: The larger rock can be acquired from an on-installation quarry operated by the government.  The quarry site is located 3 1/2 miles west of project site in Training Area 90.<BR><BR>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE<BR><BR><BR>52.202-1 	Definitions 	JUL 2004 	 <BR>52.204-9 	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel 	SEP 2007 	 <BR>52.216-24 	Limitation Of Government Liability 	APR 1984 	 <BR>52.216-25 	Contract Definalization 	OCT 2010 	 <BR>52.222-6 	Davis Bacon Act 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-7 	Withholding of Funds 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-8 	Payrolls and Basic Records 	JUN 2010 	 <BR>52.222-9 	Apprentices and Trainees 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-10 	Compliance with Copeland Act Requirements 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-11 	Subcontracts (Labor Standards) 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-12 	Contract Termination-Debarment 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-13 	Compliance with Davis-Bacon and Related Act Regulations.

Manufacturer is Vanguard Precast.<BR><BR>13)	What is the weight of the supplied RCB sections, and is it a single cell or double cell. ?<BR>Answer:  Check with Vanguard Precast on weight.  These are single cell.<BR><BR>14)	What are the elevations of the roadway and streambed on the upstream and downstream sides of the culvert?  <BR>Answer:  Approximately 12-13 feet.<BR><BR>15)	Is the RCB to be backfilled with gravel, flow-able fill, or compacted job excavated material?   <BR>Answer: Use job excavated material.<BR><BR>16)	What does the existing metal culvert consist of?<BR>Answer:  The metal culvert is 8' in diameter and is approx. 72' long.<BR><BR>17)	After removal of the existing pipe, is bedding material required to level the trench prior to placement of the new concrete culvert? <BR>Answer:  Yes, a concrete bedding according to State Standards.<BR><BR>18)	The existing concrete culvert sections are currently sealed together with some type of adhesive. Upon installation, is the concrete culvert to be sealed with a similar adhesive? Are the RCB joints to be wrapped with Mac Wrap or an equal product? If so is it also supplied?<BR>Answer:  The RCB joints are to be sealed and wrapped with Mac Wrap or equal product.  Contractor is responsible for material.<BR><BR>19)	The current pipe is not perpendicular with the road and is on a skew. If the new culvert is laid on this same general line, one end of the culvert sections will be much closer to the shoulder than the other. Is the intent to stagger the ends of the culverts to maintain a constant distance from the shoulder?<BR>Answer:  Stagger the ends of the culverts to maintain a constant distance from the shoulder.<BR><BR><BR>20)	What is the existing road surface above the proposed culvert? Is the contractor responsible for the replacement?<BR>Answer:  The existing road surface is gravel and millings (asphalt).  After culvert installation the contractor should replace road surface using existing road material.<BR><BR>21)	Is the concrete cap required to include reinforcement?<BR>Answer:  yes<BR><BR>22)	It appears that there will be ample rock to place on the ends of the culverts from what is on-site. If not, what is the gradation requirement for this rock? <BR>Answer: Use same grad as existing road ditch slopes.<BR><BR>23)	Paragraph 14 and 16 discuss erosion control. Is an SWPPP plan required to be submitted prior to construction?<BR>Answer:  No SWPPP needed.<BR><BR>24)	Wondering about the proposal forms, two kinds that need to be submitted.  Is there a certain type of form?<BR>Answer: The proposal can be emailed or faxed from the information in #2a, and 2b there no certain form for this proposal, since there is one CLIN# being used.<BR><BR>Question Change-1<BR><BR>25)	What is the bidding for the stream the culvert will set on?<BR>What is the required bedding for the RCB, and/or is a seal course required?<BR>What type and how thick is the sub base requirement under the box culvert?<BR>Answer: The use of on-site material (similar to crushed rock) to form a firm bedding is sufficient.<BR><BR>26)	 I do not understand the answer to question 3 in the Q&A sent out. We have built many precast and cast-in-place RCB's for K-Dot. There are two options in the standard spec section 735, 6" crushed stone or 3" concrete seal course. The concrete seal course "mud slab" is generally used under cast-in-place boxes in wet conditions to ease cleaning of the base rebar if mud is washed in. The reference to "Concrete bedding w/toes" is not a K-dot standard. The toe walls would be constructed with aprons and wing walls which are not detailed or called out for on this project that I can find. The way I interpret par. 10 in the RFP is that riprap shall be installed on the culvert face (for toe wall) and adjacent slopes to reduce erosion.  <BR>Answer: According to PW engineers there is no need for concrete bedding w/toes for this project.  The use of on-site material (similar to crushed rock) to form a firm bedding is sufficient.<BR><BR>27)	We believe the wording "in accordance with K-dot standards" should give us the option for the 6" crushed stone bedding, and that riprap on the culvert face per the RFP would serve as a toe wall. <BR>Answer: The riprap can serve as the toe for this project.  <BR><BR>28)	I would also like to confirm where any extra large rock for channel erosion is to come from if needed, new from off-installation or  from the owners quarry west of the project?<BR>Answer: The larger rock can be acquired from an on-installation quarry operated by the government.  The quarry site is located 3 1/2 miles west of project site in Training Area 90.<BR><BR>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE<BR><BR><BR>52.202-1 	Definitions 	JUL 2004 	 <BR>52.204-9 	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel 	SEP 2007 	 <BR>52.216-24 	Limitation Of Government Liability 	APR 1984 	 <BR>52.216-25 	Contract Definalization 	OCT 2010 	 <BR>52.222-6 	Davis Bacon Act 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-7 	Withholding of Funds 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-8 	Payrolls and Basic Records 	JUN 2010 	 <BR>52.222-9 	Apprentices and Trainees 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-10 	Compliance with Copeland Act Requirements 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-11 	Subcontracts (Labor Standards) 	JUL 2005 	 <BR>52.222-12 	Contract Termination-Debarment 	FEB 1988 	 <BR>52.222-13 	Compliance with Davis-Bacon and Related Act Regulations.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. We have a requirement for a Culvert Replacement at Honey Creek. This Request for Quote (RFQ) will be for two proposals per SOW with the project completion by NLT 1 October 2011 subject to increment weather condition.<BR><BR>This contract has one CLIN-0001: Total cost to replace culvert and complete other tasks identified in the Scope of Work.<BR><BR><BR>Section C<BR>Scope of Work<BR><BR>1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor and any necessary equipment to install Government furnished; pre-cast box culverts for a tank trail crossing over Honey Creek at Fort Riley, Kansas.  Technical Exhibit 1 indicates the project site.<BR><BR>2.  The Contractor shall submit two proposals for the project.  <BR>a. Proposal one shall be for the installation of pre-cast culverts delivered to the construction site prior to the project commencing.  <BR>b. Proposal two shall be for both the transportation of the pre-cast culverts from a location on Fort Riley approximately 13 miles from the construction site and the installation of the pre-cast culverts after transport. <BR> The Government will accept the proposal that is in its best interest.<BR><BR>3.  The Government will provide the Contractor with two paper sets of plans.  The plans are not to scale and are for general guidance.  The Contractor shall return one set of plans with "as constructed" to note any field changes to the Government within 5 business days of completion of the project.<BR><BR>4.  An electronic copy of the plans is located at Technical Exhibit 2 (Chg-1).  Potential bidders may obtain a paper copy of the plans by contacting Mr. Mike Houck, Biologist, at 785-239-2537.<BR><BR>5.  The Government will provide basic staking of the construction site based on the plans and on-site conditions at time of construction.<BR><BR>6.  The Contractor shall remove the existing metal culvert and install pre-cast box culverts following normal industry standards at the location noted on the plans and staked at the site.<BR><BR>7.  The Contractor shall insure the new pre-cast culverts are installed in a matter that does not alter the streambed gradient.  Culverts should be set on best available on-site material and compacted for firm base.  As per drawing, the Contractor shall set one or two culverts below the natural streambed gradient to allow for natural stream flow.  The finished installation shall allow fish passage and shall not back normal water flow upstream of the structure, shall not create any measurable plunge pool on the downstream side, and shall not create a pond or pooled situation over the face of the crossing.  The Contractor shall set the additional culverts above the lower culvert(s) level to handle high flow periods.<BR><BR>8.  The Contractor shall also install a concrete cap above the lower culverts that shall create a level surface over the entire culvert system. <BR><BR>9.  The Contractor shall use any rock and soil material removed from the existing roadbed site to cover the culverts.  Road surface material will be removed and used to resurface the road after construction is completed.  If additional cover is required, the Government, working with the Contractor, will designate a borrow site near the construction site.<BR><BR>10.  The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an on-installation quarry site designated by the government.  The Contractor will be responsible for loading and transporting rock from quarry site.<BR><BR>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<BR><BR>12.  The Contractor shall not conduct construction activities below the water's surface in Honey Creek during the Topeka shiner spawning period of May 15 to July 31. inclusive.  <BR><BR>13.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at least 10 days prior to construction. The COR is responsible for notifying the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Field Office  in advance of any activities which have the potential to affect any Topeka shiner habitat.<BR><BR>14.  The Contractor shall only install those roads and ramps necessary to install the pre-cast culverts.  The Contractor shall only reshape the channel is necessary to direct the natural flow to the culvert location.  The Contractor shall install erosion control structures as necessary to minimize downstream sedimentation during all activities.<BR><BR>15.  The Contractor shall clear only those trees, brush, and other debris necessary to install the culverts and access the streambed.  Trees, brush, and debris shall be piled in such a manner as not to obstruct stream flow nor block current access route.  <BR><BR>16.  The Contractor shall implement and maintain best management practices for erosion control throughout the duration of all project activities located in runoff areas to the stream.<BR><BR>17.  The Contractor shall provide seeding and/or mulching within all stream runoff areas as soon as grading allow, following the end of construction.<BR><BR>18.  The Contractor shall locate storage facilities for petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals so that discharge and runoff into stream is not possible.<BR><BR>19.  The Contractor shall make all efforts to complete all work in a timely manner so that traffic on roadway is not closed for extended periods of time.  The Contractor shall provide signage on roadway when road is closed during construction.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) when roadway is scheduled for closure.  <BR><BR>20.  The Contractor shall make all efforts not to block roadway when construction site is inactive.<BR><BR>21.  The Contractor shall coordinator with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to determine the dates available for construction.  Military training takes precedence over the work to be performed in this contract.  <BR><BR>22.  If prehistoric or historic archeological deposits or human remains are discovered during the course of this contract, the Contractor shall immediately suspend work.  The Cultural Resources Manager or his/her representative, Directorate of Public Work, notified as soon as possible.  The Fort Riley Cultural Resources Management Staff will evaluate the significance of the find and provide the Contracting Officer and COR guidance.  The Cultural Resources Manager can be reached at 785-239-3976/785-239-6211.<BR><BR>23.  The Contractor shall complete all work on this contract by October 1, 2011 unless an extension is granted by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>VENDORS QUESTIONS<BR><BR>1)	What is the bidding for the stream the culvert will set on?<BR>What is the required bedding for the RCB, and/or is a seal course required?<BR>What type and how thick is the sub base requirement under the box culvert?<BR>Answer: UNDER REVIEW BY ENGINEER (See-Below)<BR><BR>2)	Are there shop drawings available that would show the picking points for the box culverts?  <BR>Answer: We do not have shop drawings for the picking points on the culverts.<BR><BR>3)	Are these one piece box culverts, or are they made up of pieces?  <BR>How many culvert sections will be used?<BR>Answer: A total of 48 segments, each culvert length will be 8 segments long with a total of 6 culverts installed.<BR><BR>4)	Location of excess debris to be located (old culvert, excess rock)?<BR>If there is excess material after final backfill where are the excess spoils to be hauled to or used at?<BR>The excavated material that is extra how far will we need to haul for a fill site?<BR>Answer: Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will designate a site within 1/4 mile of project site.<BR><BR>5)	Will the dog leg and trees be eliminated?<BR>Does the upstream side of the creek need to be straightened or are we to install the culvert and leave the creek alone?<BR>Answer: No, the dog leg and trees will remain.

 Section I


I.1 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER--CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)  


     (a) Method of payment. 
          (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
          (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either- 
               (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
               (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
     (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
     (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. 
     (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
     (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
          (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for- 
               (i) Making a correct payment; 
               (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
     (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
     (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. 
                                                              (End of clause) 


I.2 52.239-1 PRIVACY OR SECURITY SAFEGUARDS (AUG 1996)  

 
  (a) The Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer's written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government. 
  (b) To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases. 
  (c) If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, of if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.


                                                                                                     (End of clause)

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Q: The Performance Work Statement and the Request For Proposal specifically require offerors to address "make or buy decisions" and "capital investment considerations" in the Transition Plan. We are also to use CDRL A010, DID DI-MGMT-80790, and DoD 4245.7-M to guide our response regarding these two topics. It is our understanding and experience that DoD 4245.7-M is guidance to be used to minimize risks when transitioning between acquisition lifecycle phases that apply primarily to development and acquisition of weapon systems. It is our assertion that the scope of work for the TDC contract does not involve development, production, or manufacturing. We also assert that modernization and improvements of factory operations is not within the scope of work. <br /><br />Is it the government's intention that offerors address "make or buy decisions" and "capital investment considerations" in the Transition Plan using the context and guidance provided in DoD 4245.7-M?<br />If it is not the government's intention, then can you provide us an example for how you would like offerors to address these issues?<br />If the government cannot provide examples, would a general discussion of these issues in a generic context, i.e., financial considerations that increase/decrease risk, be acceptable to the government?
<p>A: The PWS Section 7.1 and CDRL A010 have been updated on amendment 5 of the RFP.</p>
<p>Q: Reference Attachment 1 - TDC Equipment. About half way through the long list of equipment items, there is a line that reads:</p>
<p>Part Number: BENCHSTOCK <br />Desc: BENCHSTOCK SEE NOTES <br />SN: blank<br />QTY: 8,220</p>
<p>Please provide additional description of these 8,220 items. If the items are small piece parts (bolts, screws, small hand held tools, etc.) please advise how the government would like the awardee to properly account for these items during the inventory transition from the incumbent contractor?</p>
<p>A: The TEP has been updated to remove this from the list on amendment 5 of the RFP.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Amendment 02: The purpose of this Amendment is to delete the current Proposal Summary Chart Template and replace with a revised Proposal Summary Chart Template, attached to the BAA.

<p class="MsoNormal">Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Microsystems Technology Office&rsquo;s (MTO) mission is to exploit breakthroughs in materials, devices, circuits, and mathematics to develop beyond leading edge Microsystems components with revolutionary performance and functionality to enable new platform capability for the Department of Defense. To execute this mission, MTO supports revolutionary research in electronics, photonics, MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new capabilities to sense, communicate, energize, actuate, and process data and information for the war fighter.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">MTO regularly publishes Broad Agency Announcements requesting responses to specific program topics. This announcement seeks revolutionary research ideas for topics not being addressed by ongoing MTO programs or other published BAA solicitations. This BAA is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research (Studies) that may lead to larger, focused, MTO programs in the future. Studies are defined as single phase efforts of short duration (&lt; 12 months) costing less than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whereas proposers are strongly encouraged to submit Studies to this BAA, Multi-Phase Efforts will also be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts are efforts with more than one phase that may span longer than 12 months and that may cost more than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts must also cover discernable research topic areas that lead to clearly defined, quantitative technical metrics.</p>

Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.

The RFQ should be posted on the website on or before March 7, 2011.

The number of hospitalized TBI patients has increased in the last four (4) years due to combat in the Middle East.  The leading causes of TBI are bullets and fragments, blasts, falls, motor vehicle-traffic crashes and assaults.  Blasts are the primary cause, in combination with other events, of TBI for active duty military personnel in war zones.  The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) is a unique health care collaboration of the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and civilian partners that promotes state-of-the-art medical care, innovative clinical investigations and educational programs to serve active duty military, their dependents and veterans with TBI.  DVBIC develops and provides advanced TBI-specific evaluation, treatment and follow-up care as well as effective educational materials for the prevention, treatment of TBI and management of its long-term effect.  DVBIC does not possess the human resources in order to fulfill its mission with federal government employees.  The center must supplement its workforce by contracting with a private entity that can provide the wide range of skill sets and knowledge necessary to meet the center's objectives.  <BR><BR>DVBIC is headquartered at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) with across the CONUS and one OCONUS site, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.  <BR><BR>This contract will support DVBIC HQ as well as all of the following Network Sites:<BR><BR>Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, DC	<BR>Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), Germany<BR>San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), TX	<BR>Fort Bragg, NC<BR>Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD), CA	<BR>Fort Carson, CO<BR>VA Center - Richmond, VA	<BR>Camp Lejeune, NC<BR>VA Center - Tampa, FL	<BR>Fort Hood, TX<BR>VA Center - Palo Alto, CA	<BR>Camp Pendleton, CA<BR>VA Center - Minneapolis, MN	<BR>VA Center - Boston, MA<BR>DVBIC-Johnstown, PA	<BR>DVBIC-Charlottesville, VA<BR>Fort Belvoir, VA	<BR><BR>The geographic dispersion of the sites provides convenience for patients and a greater population for the center, which increases the likelihood military and veterans will receive the proper evaluation and treatment for TBI.   <BR><BR>The following are the primary objectives for DVBIC program: <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue to deploy high-performing management, medical, scientific, and administrative personnel to provide state-of-the-art treatment and performance of all required DVBIC operation sites; <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue protocols, and training procedures for response to all manner of issues that may be present during contract performance;<BR><BR> 	Enhance the capabilities of the DVBIC and Department's operational elements and other Federal, State, and local agencies in TBI science and patient care to fulfill the DVBIC related missions; <BR><BR> 	Develop or continue methods and capabilities to manage and assess patient conditions and outcomes and anticipate emerging issues;<BR><BR>o	Develop and expand Telemedicine initiatives<BR>o	Develop and expand TBI education programs directed toward providers, patients and family members<BR><BR> 	Expand on-going TBI surveillance of military personnel returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF);<BR><BR> 	Investigate the efficacy of a variety of medications and rehabilitation strategies in treating/eliminating the effects of TBI;<BR><BR> 	Conduct large-scale evaluation studies and surveys to assist with decisions regarding return to work, training, and battlefield operations and to monitor the incidence and type of brain injuries experienced in war and peacetime operations.<BR><BR>The primary objective for this procurement is to provide and improve TBI care for active duty military, guard, reserve, veterans, and their eligible beneficiaries through individual contract health care providers only to the extent necessary for providing the healthcare, research, clinical investigations, and other services required under this contract.  This performance of healthcare services by the individual contract health care providers under a personal services contract are subject to day-to-day supervision, clinical oversight and control by healthcare facility personnel comparable to that exercised over military and civil service health care providers engaged in comparable healthcare services<BR><BR>After results of this market research are obtained NARCO may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract.

<DESC>CMS has awarded Firm-Fixed Price contract, HHSM-500-2011-00003C to Signature Consulting Group, LLC of Columbia, MD. The contract award is a five (5) year base with four (4) option years for HITECH Audit Support services. This award was made on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 19.8 "Contracting with The Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).
<p>The ARRA specifies that CMS shall commence making payments effective January 1, 2011, or as soon as CMS systems are capable. The audit process will need be started soon after the first payments are made. An audit support contractor is needed at this time to assist CMS in developing the audit procedures and processes.</p>
<p>Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) amends Titles XVIII and XIX of Social Security Act (the Act) by establishing incentive payments for EPs and hospitals to promote the adoption and meaningful use of Health Information Technology (HIT) and qualified Electronic Health Record (EHRs). The expanded use of HIT and EHRs is considered essential in order to significantly improve both the quality and value of American health care. Collectively, these provisions, together with Title XIII of Division A of ARRA, are termed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act).</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor National Government Services, Inc. under the current contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0004Z in the amount of $60,558 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC><strong>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</strong>
<p><strong>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY<br /><br /></strong>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Contracting Activity: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)<br />Purchase Request Number: E-1-1293<br />This program is funded with GDIP, GDIP CT, CAIS, AF ISR-A and DIA funds.<br /><br /><strong>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br /><br /></strong>The action being processed is to extend the effective ordering period of contract FA8750-05-D-0037 (Target Exploitation Development and Support (TEDS)) from "sixty (60) months from the contract effective date" to "seventy-one (71) months from the contract effective date" and to issue a new cost-plus-fixed-fee order to continue essential operation and maintenance of the Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT), the Joint Targeting Database (JTDB) and the Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) until the Integrated Targeting Automation Capability (ITAC) and Defense Intelligence Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Enterprise (DIME) competitive acquisitions (FA8750-10-R-0002 and FA8750-10-R-0157) are awarded. The award of ITAC will provide operation and maintenance for JTT and JTDB, while DIME will provide operation and maintenance of MIDB. The effective ordering period under the TEDS contract expired 7 Apr 2010, which necessitates an extension to 7 Mar 2011 so that this new order (Order 0035) can be placed on contract. <br /><br /><strong>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br /><br /></strong>Under the contemplated new order, the contractor will provide operation and maintenance for the JTT, JTDB and MIDB programs until the ITAC and DIME acquisitions are awarded. It is anticipated that ITAC will be awarded about 8 February 2011 and DIME about 31 May 2011. Currently, TEDS Order 0031 provides maintenance of the JTT and JTDB programs through 13 Jan 2011 and TEDS Order 0033 provides maintenance of the MIDB through 24 Feb 2011. The new order will provide the continued maintenance of the JTT, JTDB and MIDB so there will be no break in service. These programs are used by the warfighter and the intelligence Community (IC) worldwide to provide the intelligence they require to satisfy mission requirements. The new order will include only the minimum work that must continue to support the warfighter and IC requirements and schedules necessary to satisfy their critical missions; namely, troubleshooting software problems, testing software patches, on-site training and installation support, life cycle support, on-going exercise support, MIDB Tier 3 Operations Support, and central maintenance facility for JTT and JTDB suite of software applications.<br />Approximately 46,000 hours will be required between 14 Jan 2011- 30 June 2011 to provide the necessary maintenance for JTT, JTDB and MIDB and to support the transition of work between the contracting vehicles (TEDS Order 0031 and ITAC Order 0001; TEDS Order 0033 and DIME Order 0002). TEDS Order 0035 will be funded with O&amp;M money and have a ceiling of $4,800,000.<br /><br /><strong>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br /></strong>10 USC 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). Specifically, for DIA, the Intelligence Community and the DOD warfighters, the continued provision of highly specialized services is required from the original source as an award to any other source for this 5.5 month bridge effort would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's and community's requirements for National Intelligence, General Military Intelligence (Order of Battle), Tactical Intelligence, Targeting Intelligence (Target Views), Terrorist / Insurgence Intelligence (CT/CI/CD/CI data), Cyber Intelligence (multi-spectrum C4 networks) intelligence information and information dissemination.<br /><br /><strong>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) </strong></p>
<p>Currently, the JTT and MIDB work is accomplished under Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract No. FA8750-05-D-0037 (Target Exploitation Development and Support (TEDS)) with Northrop Grumman Defense Mission Systems, Inc. TEDS was awarded on 8 Apr 2005 (with an effective ordering period to 7 Apr 2010) in order to continue development and enhancement of the current targeting functionality of Air Force (AF) and joint targeting automation software and continue development towards full automation of all needed targeting capabilities including support to all elements of the joint targeting cycle and to time-critical and time-sensitive targeting operations. The TEDS effort includes making changes to improve performance and be more responsive to operational needs; upgrading the current suite of applications with new versions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and newly developed (Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)) software; supporting integration testing with various operating environments (Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS), Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), Joint Digital Intelligence Support System (JDISS), Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), GCCS-Maritime (M), GCCS Integrated Intelligence and Imagery (I3), GCCS-Air Force (GCCS-AF), etc.), and responding to user mission needs concerning the initialization, operation, and management of the supported suite of applications. TEDS was a competitive solicitation whereby three proposals were received and the award made to Northrop Grumman based on the best overall value to the government.</p>
<p>The JTT Program is responsible for maintenance and delivery of all software developed from a central maintenance facility. Currently JTT is being tested and integrated into the Global Command and Control System and requires continuous troubleshooting and life cycle support as the integration effort progresses through testing. Additionally, JTT is currently engaged in an upgrade of the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) as part of a larger intelligence application modernization. JTT is one of the critical applications being upgraded and this is the culmination of over three years of effort to synchronize the AOC targeting application with the Combatant Command's targeting application. As these events progress, new Problem Reports (PRs) will surface and there is the possibility of providing required on-site system maintenance and training during the gap between TEDS and ITAC.</p>
<p>The MIDB Program is responsible for maintenance and delivery of all software developed from a central maintenance facility and for data maintenance, replication/dissemination, and data extracts in support of DIA, the Intelligence Community and the DOD warfighters for National Intelligence, General Military Intelligence (Order of Battle), Tactical Intelligence, Targeting Intelligence (Target Views), Terrorist / Insurgence Intelligence (CT/CI/CD/CI data), Cyber Intelligence (multi-spectrum C4 networks) intelligence information. This requires continuous troubleshooting and lifecycle support of the infrastructure, the applications and the data.</p>
<p>JTT and MIDB are also responsible for conducting on-going support to the warfighter in the form of on-site installation support, on-site user training and helpdesks. These functions are critical to JTT and MIDB software components being successfully installed at a user site. Additionally, JTT and MIDB support on-going exercises and experiments.</p>
<p>The highly specialized services provided by Northrop Grumman that must continue without interruption include troubleshooting software problems, testing software patches, on-site training and installation support, life cycle support, on-going exercise support, MIDB Tier 3 Operations Support, and central maintenance facility for JTT and JTDB suite of software applications. Without the capability to provide these highly specialized services, the JTT and MIDB users will quickly experience mission performance degradation and possible mission stoppage. This degradation and downtime which would last for approximately 5 months will prevent users from accomplishing their primary mission: the conduct of Order of Battle production, target development, combat assessment, theater targeting coordination, and support to mission planning for Counter Terrorism, Counter Intelligence, Counter Drug, Counter Insurgency and Cyber missions. A gap in performance of this magnitude will adversely affect mission accomplishment at all combatant commands as well as the functional AOC's and other intelligence community partners.</p>
<p>The JTT and MIDB Programs require Northrop Grumman's highly specialized capabilities to operate and maintain these critical intelligence systems for this short duration Order. A new contractor would not be able to immediately get up to speed to take over these activities; and it would be impractical to conduct a separate competition to cover the interim period given that competitive solicitations have already been issued for the work and are in process. In addition, waiting for the award of the ITAC and DIME competitive solicitations to continue this support presents an unacceptable 5.5 month delay in fulfilling the government's requirements. As such, there would be significant risk to not only AF, but the Joint community targeting systems if the effective ordering period of the TEDS contract is not extended to allow the award of Order 0035 to bridge the gap between the work being performed under Orders 0031 and 0033 and ITAC Order 0001 (FA8750-10-R-0002/0001) and DIME Order 0002 (FA8750-10-R-0157/0002).</p>
<p>Therefore, the extension of the ordering period and subsequent award of a follow-on Order will be for the continued performance of a highly specialized service; namely, the continued maintenance of critical joint community targeting systems that directly impact mission accomplishment. Further, Northrop Grumman is the only firm capable of providing the services described above without the U.S. Air Force and IC experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p><strong>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE </strong></p>
<p>The extension of the ordering period and subsequent award of Order 0035 will be only a "bridge" between the current maintenance for JTT, JTDB and MIDB and the maintenance that will be provided by the ITAC and DIME contracts once they are awarded. ITAC was competitively solicited and one proposal was received on 27 Sep 2010 from the Contractor currently performing the TEDS contract. DIME was competitively solicited on 16 Nov 2010 and proposals are due 17 Dec 2010. Upon approval of this proposed sole source action, a notice of proposed contract action required by FAR 5.203(a) will be published on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p><strong>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE </strong></p>
<p>The anticipated cost of Order 0035 will be considered fair and reasonable, based on a detailed cost analysis that will be performed upon receipt of the proposal and comparison with historical data from the TEDS contract. Certified cost or pricing data will be obtained from the contractor, DCAA and DCMA will be contacted for rate recommendations and a technical and resource evaluation will be completed by the program manager to ensure the proposed technical approach is acceptable and the resources are reasonable. Negotiations will ensure that the final order estimated cost and fixed fee are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Market research was recently accomplished for the ITAC and DIME solicitations and the results may be applied to this sole source action. Although market research identified other companies that may be capable of meeting the requirements of this Order, these services are deemed to be available only from the original source because the services are highly specialized and need to continue without interruption; awarding to any other source for this short duration period of support would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the government's requirements. This "bridge" Order will only be approximately 5.5 months in duration and a new contractor would not be able to immediately get up to speed to take over these activities. Further, there are no currently viable alternate sources for ITAC. This is based on the fact that the recent competitive solicitation of the $49.69M ITAC acquisition resulted in only one proposal received from the TEDS contractor.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br />None.<br />X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br />See Section VI above.<br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br />This Order is only a "bridge" between the TEDS Contract and the award of the ITAC and DIME contracts. The ITAC and DIME acquisitions are full and open competition.<br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p><br />XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>HHSM500201100021P
<DESC>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) was enacted on February 17, 2009 to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of health information technology (HIT) and electronic health information exchange. The HITECH Act also amended several sections of the Social Security Act and in doing so established the availability of incentive payments to eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to promote the adoption and meaningful use of interoperable HIT. Title IV, Division B of the HITECH Act establishes incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for certain professionals and hospitals that meaningfully use certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) was charged with developing the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs and determining the clinical quality measures (CQMs) for reporting from EHRs that meet one of the criteria for meaningful use.
<p>In order for the CQM data to be abstracted from the EHR, a set of inpatient CQMs were retooled into electronic specification format in anticipation of the healthcare industry incorporating widespread interoperable exchange of electronic data. In September 2008, CMS engaged the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP), through its partner Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), to retool this set of existing clinical quality measures to use EHR generated data.</p>
<p>The HITECH Act requires quality measures to be reported out of electronic health records. This submission process is a new and emerging course of action that requires standards and context applied to patient care data that in many cases have never existed in the past. As we work through these processes, CMS has received public comments and validated that the hospital clinical quality measures electronic specifications contain errors which require review of the specifications and modification of these errors in order to satisfy the HITECH reporting requirements of the CQM data for hospitals.<br /><br />For this effort, CMS will obtain services for the review and modification, as necessary, for the errors contained in the eight HITSP clinical quality measures electronic specifications which are used for hospitals in the ARRA HITEH Incentive Program.<br /><br />The Government will not entertain correspondence related to this posted notice.<br /></p>

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition
1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."
Agency:	U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Contracting Activity:	Contracting Officer: Mark A. Edzards
  VISN 15 Contracting Office
  4101 S. 4th Street Traffic way
  Leavenworth, Kansas 66048
2	Nature and/or description of the action being approved. This justification and approval is for a firm-fixed price, membership/subscription service
3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). $52,125.00 per year.  The total amount for a base and 4 option years is $260.625.00
4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements
5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. EO 13514 and 13423 requirements necessitate the need for the VHA to improve our knowledge and find more innovative ways to implement pollution prevention programs that target hospital specific wastes and toxic chemicals to continue in improving on our current waste and toxic reduction efforts.  We also need to become aware of the latest technologies for "sustainable buildings" and offer our facilities avenues to enhance their awards programs.  The sole vendor for providing a health care specific technical forum with cross feed of information from the regulated hospital community on a national scale is Practice Greenhealth, a non-profit owned business and collaborative effort consisting of Hospitals for a Healthy Environment (H2E), the Green Guide for Health Care, and the Healthcare Clean Energy Exchange.  This organization offers its members a full range of tools, resources, forums, technical assistance, and networking opportunities to engage the healthcare design, construction and operations sectors in creating safe and healthy healthcare environments.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes these organizations in their Partnership for Sustainable Healthcare (PSH) program which recommends H2E and Practice Greenhealth as the healthcare industry source for environmental sustainability and waste and toxic reduction resource clearinghouse.  

The purpose in continuing this membership and subscription includes access to health care related environmental and green initiative resources, as well as personal interactions with private sector health care industry partners to allow for cross feed on health care specific innovative solutions to environmental compliance issues, energy conservation, green construction, and pollution prevention.  The service also includes phone consult, conference call participation, conference attendance, web list serve online discussions and document sharing with other subscribers, and research tools and resources.  Subscribers also have the opportunity to participate in environmental awards programs for their efforts in pollution prevention, waste reduction, improved energy efficiency, and toxic hazard reduction, which will help our agency employ incentive and award programs for exceptional performers in implementing the goals of the EO.  Numerous VA facilities are active with Practice Green health, have been awarded Environmental Excellence Awards, and utilize their services to assist in developing sustainable practices at their facilities.  A VHA wide subscription to the partnership program will allow all VAMCs to utilize these services at a 50% discounted group rate saving approximately $52,000 over the cost of individual subscriptions at each medical center.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. A notice of intent to award a sole source action was published to Fedbizops.
6.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. At a minimum a price analysis to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable will be conducted. If a determination cannot be made even after obtaining additional information from sources other than the offeror, the contractor will be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support further analysis.
7.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. Market research indicates that Siemens Medical Solutions has proprietary rights to OEM parts and diagnostic software for this equipment.
8.	Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition. None.
9.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None.
10.	A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. N/A.
11.	Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.

.
12.	 Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.
