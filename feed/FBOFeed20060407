<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), U. S. Department of the Interior, intends to competitively award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Government reserves the right to issue a single IDIQ or multiple IDIQ contracts.  The Government anticipates issuing time and materials-type task orders with direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:   The purpose of the proposed study is to obtain information and field data on the environmental fate and effects of a synthetic-based drilling fluid (SBF) accidental release. This study has the following objectives: (1) to determine the spatial distribution of SBF on the seafloor after an accidental release, (2) to evaluate the initial environmental impact, (3) to compare the data generated from the spill location to relevant SBF cuttings discharge studies, and (4) if possible, to evaluate the temporal changes of the accidental release.  The study hinges upon the occurrence of an appropriate spill of opportunity, of sufficient volume and at a location close to the seafloor so that SBF accumulates.  Sampling should occur within eight months of the accidental release. The location of the spill, based on historical information, is expected to be in deeper waters (1500 ft.- 6500 ft.).  Five primary tasks are associated with this effort. They are to (1) prepare a preliminary cruise plan, (2) conduct field sampling at the designated site, (3) analyze the samples, (4) interpret, synthesize, and report data, and (5) evaluate the temporal changes at the site.  The aerial extent and distribution of the SBF should be determined through visual and mechanical sampling.  Measurements that may be considered are ROV submersible surveys, sediment coring, sediment screening measurements, swath bathymetry/multi beam or similar high resolution sonar mapping.  The field sample collection and sample analysis task should include representative physical and chemical sampling of the sediments and water in the area impacted by the spill. The physical and chemical parameters of interest for sediments include, but are not limited to grain size, organic carbon content, dissolved oxygen content, oxidation/reduction potential, total petroleum hydrocarbon content (TPH), and indicators of drilling and production wastes. Field sampling and analysis should include the parent SBF and breakdown product content.  The synthesis report should include historical information about accidental releases, an expert discussion of synthetic based fluid fate and effects in the marine environment, comparison of results to permitted discharges, a summary of the observations made during the site visit and the analytical results, and an expert discussion of the environmental effects at the selected site.  HOW TO COMPETE:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, and to receive a copy of the request for proposal (RFP), interested organizations MUST submit their company name, address, phone and fax number, point of contact and email address to the attention of Debra Bridge, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170; E-MAIL debra.bridge@mms.gov. by 3:00 p.m. Friday, April 21, 2006.  Please include with this information the Solicitation No. 39572, and title "Deepwater Program:  Synthetic-Based Fluid Spill of Opportunity."  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Washington for the purpose of performing research on salmon reproduction, imprinting, and genetics research.   Period of Performance: June 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007, with options for performance in future years.

There are three tasks required for this work. 

1) Assist with determining the effects of growth on age of sexual maturity and ovarian development in chinook salmon, and determining the effects of temperature manipulation on spawn timing in spring chinook salmon.  The following are required for this work: a) rearing of chinook and coho salmon on specified rations to control growth rate in different groups of experimental fish, b) collection of tissues and plasma from experimental fish, c) measurement of plasma and pituitary gonadotropins, plasma sex steroids, and IGF I by radioimmunossay, d) measurement of ovarian gene transcripts  (gonadotropin and growth hormone receptors, IGF I and IGF II, steroid acute regulatory protein) from experimental fish by real time PCR, e) suppression subtraction hybridization cloning of ovarian genes, f) computer image analysis of gonad development from histological sections of gonads from experimental fish, g) ultrasound to identify maturing fish, and h) statistical analyses and interpretation of data collected from experimental fish.  All analyses and fish rearing will be conducted at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

2) Assist with laboratory, behavioral and field  assessments of olfactory imprinting by sockeye and Chinook salmon. To determine the critical period(s) for imprinting, juvenile salmon are being exposed to known odorants at key developmental stages and are being tested subsequently for development of long-term memories of these odorants.  Results of these experiments will be important to determine the critical periods for imprinting for the offspring of captively-reared fish destined for release into natal rivers or lakes. The following are required for this work: a) maintain odor exposure equipment and odorants, b) conduct routine sampling of fish for tissue and physiological assays to assess smolting and imprinting, c) assist with behavioral assessments of imprinting in experimental stream channel, d) conduct electro-olfactogram (EOG) assessments of imprinted sockeye salmon and e) assist with molecular assessments of imprinting f) assist with carcass and redd surveys to assess imprinting and homing success of Chinook salmon.

3) Assist with collecting biological information and conducting genetic and phenotypic analyses of inbreeding-study families of University of Washington stock Chinook salmon. Assistance is required to capture experimental adult fish as they return to the Portage Bay hatchery and retrieve biological data, coded-wire tag information, and genetic samples from them.  Assistance with establishing experimentally inbred families and control families, followed by periodic sampling of juvenile study fish for size and growth, and with relating this information to family and cross information is also required.  Modest assistance in conducting genetic analyses of the family data for estimation of inbreeding coefficients and for maintaining pedigree records for the study is required.

Deliverables will be in the form of data collected from experiments and summarized in a FY07 annual report.  The report shall be delivered to the COTR by September 30, 2007.  The government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the University of Washington, as we believe this is the only source with such unique expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the work.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capabilty, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Linda Shaw, NOAA, WRAD, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such solicitation.   See numbered note 22.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).   For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-26 Wireless Adaptable Network Node (WANN); CLOSING DATE: Two (2) years after publication; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  24 May 2006; 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Points of Contact:  Preston Marshall and Stephen Griggs, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA06-26@darpa.mil; Web site: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/WANN/index.htm.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals for the design, development, and demonstration of low-cost wireless network nodes which support adaptation by means of distributed network processing for the Wireless Adaptable Network Node (WANN). 
The WANN program is divided into four phases:  Radio Phase 1 (R1) – Design; Radio Phase 2 (R2) – Wireless Node Development; Radio Phase 3 (R3) – Medium Scale Demonstration; and Radio Phase 4 (R4) – Large Scale Demonstration. This WANN BAA is soliciting proposals covering the first two phases of the WANN program.  Phase R2 will be included as an option that can be executed at the end of Phase R1.  Proposals for the final two phases R3 and R4 may be solicited at a later time.  Although the cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA should only address Phases R1 and R2, the government requests that you submit rough order magnitude (ROM) costs for Phases R3 and R4.  The ROM costs are for government planning purposes and will not be evaluated as part of the proposal evaluation.  Because the production of a significant quantity of WANNs in Phases R3 and R4 is critical to the overall program success, your overall vision for all WANN phases should be addressed in your program plan and this vision will be evaluated as part of your technical approach.
The WANN development effort is one of two complementary program elements within the larger DARPA wireless networking vision; the other program element, the Network Development effort, focuses on the development of adaptive network topologies required to weld individual WANN nodes into an adaptive ad hoc network.  A separate BAA for development of the network technologies required to support the vision is planned for release at a later date.  Successful completion of the DARPA wireless technology vision will require a tight coupling of the Wireless Adaptable Network Node development effort and the network technology development effort.  
Previous practice has been to build high-cost, hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes.  This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density.  Proposers should assume node densities associated with deployments in which each warfighter and each vehicle has at least one radio node.
The objectives of each phase of the Wireless Adaptable Network Node development effort are as follows:
•	Radio Phase 1 (R1) (6 months):
o	Conduct Critical Design Review (CDR) and define performance of objective WANN, including the strategy and risk mitigation approach for integrating filters, Radio Frequency (RF) / baseband processing, and wideband antennas for Phase R2 units.  The WANN architecture developed in Phase R1 is expected to remain unchanged throughout the remaining phases.  
o	Develop and publish non-proprietary network interface Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for integration of network technologies / processes within the WANN.
o	Develop cost basis for $500 unit cost in quantity 100K, excluding Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), batteries, and set-up charges.
o	Develop evidence that the unit cost in quantity is sustainable throughout the system life-cycle, given that components used in the WANN can be expected to change during this time.
•	Radio Phase 2 (R2) (15 months):
o	Build and test 40 WANNs that achieve performance stated in Phase R1, implement the network API, and integrate filters, RF / baseband processing, and wideband antennas.
o	Demonstrate WANN performance with voice and Internet Protocol (IP) networking in a small scale network (minimum 10 nodes).
•	Radio Phase 3 (R3) (12 months):
o	Build 100 WANNs using production line processes (based on commercial methodologies and assembly lines).
o	Conduct medium scale (100 units) field demonstration of a multicast, highly adaptive network (demonstration led by network developer and supported by WANN developer).
•	Radio Phase 4 (R4) (12 months):
o	Build 500-1000 WANNs using production line processes (based on commercial methodologies and assembly lines).
o	Demonstrate scalable production capacity for annual production of 100K units.
o	Achieve large scale (500-1000 units) operational demonstration of an adaptive, highly dynamic, self-forming, self-healing military network (demonstration led by network developer and supported by WANN developer).

Performers will be expected to maintain the cost basis of $500 per unit in quantity 100K throughout all four phases.

Proposals should cite the quantitative and qualitative success criteria that the proposed effort will achieve at the end of each phase to support the overall program objectives: 

•	Development of a low cost ($500) handheld military network radio based on commercial production parts, lines, and processes that supports network adaptation. 
•	Development of a network capability that adapts to mitigate hardware shortfalls.
•	Support of internetworking at IP rather than waveform in heterogeneous networks.
•	Brigade-sized demonstration (500 - 1000 nodes) of an adaptive, highly dynamic, self-forming and self-healing military network.
•	Sustainable $500 unit cost (excluding NRE, batteries, and set-up charges) throughout the system life cycle.  Ongoing set-up charges will be considered as part of the life-cycle cost evaluation.

Determination of estimated cost should be based on production node quantities of 1,000 and 100,000, and should include a detailed basis and analysis of the manufacturing learning curve.  The Government intends to contract for an independent review and analysis of the cost basis.
This BAA shall remain open for two (2) years from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov. Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.   Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instructions provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA06-26) on or before 12 noon, 24 May, 2006, Eastern Standard Time (EST). 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs) and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small, or small and disadvantaged businesses due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transactions for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.
A Proposers’ Day Conference was held on 16 March.  The information from this conference will be available on the WANN website: www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/WANN/index.htm.  Attendance at the Proposers’ Day was not a prerequisite to responding to this BAA.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal to the program.  In descending order of importance, the evaluation criteria are: 1) Technical Approach with elements: (a) Program Scope and Robustness, (b) Wireless Node Performance and Flexibility, (c) Support for Network Adaptation Performance, (d) Practicality of Commercial Manufacturing and Sustainability of Wireless Node Production Cost and (e) Program Flexibility and Risk Mitigation; 2) Management Approach; 3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and 4) Cost Realism.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA, and to make award without discussions.   Further, DARPA may choose to select for negotiation all of a given proposal, or from selected portions thereof, and make award without discussion. For evaluation purposes, the Government will only evaluate the costs of Phases R1 and R2.
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the Proposers’ Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  The PIP is available at www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov. 
NOTE: ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE SENT TO BAA06-26@darpa.mil.

<DESC>This is a sole source acquisition to conduct research and technology testing activities to develop high-level waste (HLW) glass compositions for the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).  This work involves the formulation and testing of prototypic HLW glass compositions to establish acceptable glass composition ranges.  This work will include formulating glasses in small scale crucible melts (nominally 20-40 gram of glass) and continuous melter testing at a rate of 200-400 kg/day. This work is needed to support projections of HLW glass production in the WTP to support finalization of the WTP HLW Vitrification facility design. Based on its work on a recent contract with the Idaho Operations Office, Duratek/CUA is the only provider that currently has the necessary testing capability in terms of glass development and testing laboratories to continue these services without disruption to the Hanford mission.

<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for Automated Litigation Support services for the Department.  Automated litigation support encompasses a wide range of professional services and products that help attorneys acquire, organize, develop, and present evidence throughout the course of litigation, from pre-filing investigation, through complaint, discovery, and trial, through post-trial briefs and the appeals process.  Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, materials, and technologies necessary to provide a wide range of professional services and products through the course of litigation.  The types of litigation support required under this contract will generally fall into the following areas:	(1) Document acquisition; (2) Database creation; (3) Electronic data acquisition and production; (4) Database utilization; (5) Pre-trial and trial support; (6) Specialized professional services; and 
(7) Contract and project management.  DOJ currently has litigation support programs in seven of its litigating components - Civil Division, Antitrust Division, Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division, Tax Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  All seven existing programs consist of Government specialists who define case- or investigation-specific requirements and then manage contractor-provided case support using contracts designed for automated litigation support.  All seven programs are presently making use of our "Mega 2" automated litigation support contracts awarded in November 2001 for this purpose.  As many as five (5) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts are anticipated for this requirement. The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for each resultant contract with five additional option periods of one year each for a total period of performance of seventy-two (72) months. The solicitation will be available on or about May 08, 2006.  Due date for receipt of proposals will be approximately forty (40) days after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS

Bridge engineers have used accelerated bridge construction practices successfully for many years worldwide.  Now with the advent of high performance materials and emerging new technologies, the paradigm is rapidly changing to give greater emphasis on accelerated construction for renewal of the Nation’s highway infrastructure involving roads, bridges, and other structures.  The accelerated bridge construction technology with automated fabrication and construction aligns itself well with the strategic goals of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in improving safety, mobility and production, human and natural environments and organizational excellence.

The scope of this work includes developing a demonstration project for steel and concrete bridges to achieve “Integrated Project Delivery and Project Management” objectives and identify available technologies; develop integrated engineering software demonstration package(s) that has promise to promote faster and more efficient automated processes applicable through the entire life cycle (design, fabrication, construction, and preservation) for bridge owners and contractors.  The engineering software package will include guidelines and training materials to drive transition among users from current practices to synergistic integrated automation.  Integrated automation through 3-D modeling will be an extension of the conventional 2-D methodology in designing, constructing and maintaining bridges.  This project will generate an architectural blueprint for integrating various phases into the automated processes, yet it will have the potential to produce significantly improved 2-D design drawings as well as construction drawings in conjunction with life cycle management through automation.    Concepts identified will be evaluated for feasibility and those found to have merit shall be recommended for the development and demonstrations, including half-day and two-day modules.   

It is anticipated that the resulting contract duration will be for 30 months.  It is anticipated this requirement will be Full and Open to all sources.    The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system at http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the Vendors option followed by selection of the Department of Transportation (DOT) center.    As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored.    Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email.    Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments.    The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541710.  NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is planning to purchase from Accu-Temp Inc., Kentube Engineers Products Co. Items: Fuel Economizer / Heat Exchanger.  This is a direct replacement of the existing Fuel Economizer which was installed as a part of the Keeler Boiler in 1979.  By purchasing a direct replacement of the original equipment, the cost of installation will be minimized.  The dimensions of the replacement must be compatible with the existing (i.e. any connections, water, flue) in order to eliminate any required field modifications.  The performance of the Kentube Fuel Economizer is matched to the pressurized requirements of the Keeler Boiler.  This impacts not only the preheat characteristics of the feedwater, but also the gas temperature requirements of the baghouse.  The agency is unaware of any comparable product on the market that will meet the needs of the agency.  However, the agency will consider any response(s) to this announcement received by April, 22, 2006, in determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  If the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responder of this notice; a subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a Federal Contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure main gas turbine generator (MTG) sets for the DD(X) Destroyer program on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis.  The MTG sets shall be capable of providing power for ship propulsion and for shipboard electrical power conversion for use by shipboard loads.  The MTG set shall be designed, constructed, tested and certified in accordance with the requirements of the American Bureau of Shipbuilding (ABS) Naval Vessel Rules (NVR) and the DD(X) Design, Build and Process (DB&P) specification.  The minimum output power from each MTG set shall be 36MWe at the standard rating conditions defined in ABS NVR. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitiations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Some technical specifications (including Attachments A and B) to this solicitation include a “Distribution Statement D” marking, meaning access is restricted to DoD and DoD contractors only.  In order to control access to these documents, they can only be received by written email request to tara.borntreger@navy.mil, with justification provided as to the parties need to know and purpose of the request.   This procurement will include a basic requirement for MTG set non-recurring engineering (detail design, interface definition, software development, certification, etc.), with five (5) FFP MTG set options, for a total of 10 MTG sets, that may be exercised during the five-year period of the contract, and associated engineering services.   This announcement supersedes the previously posted announcement N0002406R2308 for DD(X) main gas turbine engines.  No industry day is planned for this procurement.  A draft solicitation is being released with this announcement in FBO for industry review and comment.  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a trade off analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final RFP.  To maintain progress on the ship design, the solicitation may include a request for Early Vendor Information (EVI), that the Navy intends to provide the DD(X) shipbuilders prior to MTG set contract award.  Industry is requested to comment on warranty provisions and make recommendations on how to preserve a useful warranty period, given the MTG set will be installed but light off may not occur !  for up to two years.  Industry comment on the feasibility of this warranty period is requested.  Industry comments are requested no later than April 20, 2006.  A competitive solicitation is expected to be issued shortly thereafter.  All inquiries should be emailed to tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to competitively procure services for the development and continued operation of the Law Enforcement Information Exchange (LInX) Program in support of the Naval Criminal Investigative Services (NCIS) on an unrestricted basis.   NCIS is collaboratively engaged with local and state law enforcement agencies, as well as Homeland Defense, Department of Defense and Department of Justice, to share criminal records management and investigative information so as to affect a major impact on officer and public safety, by ensuring immediate access to information to deter criminal and terrorist related activities in applicable regions or sites within the United States with significant Navy assets. The LInX Program fully integrates law enforcement data from all participating agencies into a single regional database. Such information will be used for tactical and investigative law enforcement purposes and for producing regional counter-terrorism and investigative organized criminal enterprise strategies enhancing cooperative multi-jurisdictional investigations.  The scope of the required services includes:  (1) deployment and operation of LInX for a minimum of three new sites:  New London/Groton, CT; New Mexico; and San Diego; (2) the possible expansion of LInX in the National Capital Region, Washington State, and Florida; (3) maintenance and operation of LInX for existing sites located in Washington State; Virginia; Hawaii; Florida/Georgia; and Northern Virginia (National Capital Region); (4) development of new LInX releases, as required, to support the NCIS mission and that of other DoD and Department of Justice (DOJ) agencies; (5) systems administration and operation, training, and technical assistance for all deployed LInX systems; (6) research and prototype capabilities in support of LInX capability expansions; (7) development of LInX continuity/backup plan; and (8) development of a robust IV&V and demonstration environment.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee, Indefinitely Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with the inclusion of Firm Fixed Price Contract Line Item requirements and provisions, will result from the competitive solicitation.  The resultant contract will provide for a basis period of performance comprised of one (1) year, commencing on or around 01 November 2006, along with four (4) one-year option provisions to extend the term of the contract through 30 October 2011, if all options are exercised.  The total level of CPFF effort, inclusive of all options, is estimated to be 347,416 manhours.  In addition to this, the resultant contractor shall provide on a Firm Fixed Price basis 24/7 operation of the network operations center to monitor LInX servers, network performance, and system performance, as well as 24/7 call center service (help desk) to all agencies participating in LInX.  The solicitation will require the submission of cost/price and technical proposals.  The evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror’s technical proposal more important than price. Furthermore, the evaluation of technical proposals will give greater consideration to those offerors that demonstrate experience and past performance in the management and/or implementation of a large police department records management system or other similar law enforcement Information Technology (IT) project.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541512 and $23 Million, respectively.  Upon issuance, solicitation N00140-06-R-1217 will be made available electronically at the following internet address:  http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments issued hereto.  Number note 26 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), as executive agent acting on behalf of the Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC), seeks contractor support for the Navy’s Enhanced Use Leasing (EUL) Program.  Under 10 USC 2667, the Navy has the authority to enter into long-term leases with the private sector for certain of its properties, and receive “in-kind consideration that can be used for: maintenance, protection, alterations, repair improvement or restoration of property; construction or acquisition of new facilities; facilities operations support; and provisions of other services.”   The program seeks to maximize the financial value of the properties and leverage that value with private sector expertise to offset the cost of ongoing operations or obviate the need for capital investments.  CNIC and NAVFAC, with input from various Navy Regions, have developed a candidate list of potential EUL installations and parcels nation-wide.  The candidate list reflects those parcels that in the Navy’s view have development potential and may be of interest to the development community.  This information will be provided with the solicitation.  It is anticipated that the government will award a firm fixed price, IDIQ contract for a base year with four one-year options NTE $10M.  The following is a brief synopsis of the statement of work for Phase I and Phase II.
PHASE-1  Economic/Market Analysis Feasibility Study.  This study will evaluate the development potential of each parcel and the potential  return to the Government.  The Contractor will (a) test the Government’s concept for development, if one is identified, of the parcels against market conditions considering the Government’s financial objectives, or (b) conduct a market analysis of the parcel for Government consideration.  In both scenarios the contractor will observe Government guidance on uses consistent with the mission of the host installation.  If applicable, the contractor will also identify refinements to the Government’s concepts or alternative project concepts that may improve upon the Government’s concept.  To complete this task, the Contractor will be guided by the procedures from the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and the Uniform Standards of Federal Land Acquisitions.  
The objective of the study is to assist the Government’s understanding of the development potential of the parcel(s) in order to shape developer solicitations so as to maximize return to the Navy and ensure maximum opportunity for creativity in the proposal.  The study will  investigate the relationship between the demand for and the competitive supply of comparable development opportunities in the market area.  In establishing  demographic factors such as population and employment trends, employment base and income will be investigated and considered.  The overall market will then be evaluated, based upon the Contractor’s research of the local and regional markets, using current information with regard to available rental prices and absorption for the suggested use(s) of the property.  The Contractor will brief the results of the Phase 1 analysis to the EUL Management Team.
PHASE-2 Task 1: Preparation of Notice of Intent to Lease; Task 2: Plan and Host Industry Forum; Task 3: Information Management Support; Task 4:Assistance in Evaluation of Proposals; and Task 5:  Business and Leasing Plan Development Assistance.

Proposal evaluation will be based on technical, past performance, and cost/price.  Complete information regarding evaluation factors will be provided in the solicitation.  The government anticipates issuing the solicitation on/about 19 April 2006 via http://esol.navfac.nav.mil/  

There will be a pre-proposal conference on Wednesday, 26 April 2006 at 9AM at the Catering and Conference Center (Bldg. 211) at the Washington Navy Yard.  Please contact LaWanda Robinson at Lawanda.robinson@navy.mil no later than noon on 24 April 2006 to register.  Each individual attending will need to provide Ms. Robinson with the following information in order to obtain access to the base:
Individual’s name, name of company, approximate time of arrival, and the building you will be going to.  The conference center has been reserved for three hours but is not expected to last that long.

Additionally, each attendee will be required to present valid identification upon entry.

Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  

Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in the award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel on Design Team and Construction Team, and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.

The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel on Design Team and Construction Team, and Technical Solution.  

This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION.

<DESC>Ames Research Center (ARC) has requirements for Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials and design concepts in support of heat shield development for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  The CEV is expected to serve as the primary manned space vehicle for the United States following retirement of the Space Shuttle.  Its requirements include the ability to service the International Space Station as well as missions to the moon and eventually to Mars.  The heat shield provides the essential thermal protection during CEV return to Earth from these missions.  The NASA CEV TPS Advanced Development Project (ADP) at ARC is responsible for the advanced development of TPS design concepts and engineering in support of the CEV project.  On November 23, 2005 NASA Ames issued separate purchase orders to four contractors as a result of the TPS Phase I full and open competition on Ames solicitation number NNA05128299Q-AMD.  These awards required the delivery of unique and proprietary TPS material coupons for arcjet and flexural load testing.	Furthermore, NASA Ames is currently planning the second phase of this procurement which will also be conducted as a full and open competition (see Ames solicitation number NNA06145270R).	In the meantime, the TPS ADP has determined that additional quantities of Phase I material coupons are needed for continued testing and analysis. NASA/ARC intends to purchase these proprietary materials from Applied Research Associates (Phen-Carb materials), Boeing (PICA materials), Lockheed Martin Space Systems (Advanced Carbon-Carbon with Calcarb materials), Textron Systems (Avcoat 5026-39 materials), and Textron Systems (3D-Q/P-HD/LD (Dual Layer) materials) in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  These orders will be issued to the above contractors as modifications to the current purchase orders. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. Pacific time on April 17, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: Laboratory taxonomic identification and enumeration of benthic macroinvertebrate samples.

BACKGROUND AND SCOPE: Two hundred eleven (211) benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected by the Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program in 2005 for use in watershed condition assessments. An additional 160 samples are anticipated to be collected in 2006. These samples represent one attribute in a suite of attributes used to conduct the assessments in western Washington and Oregon and northwest California. The watershed condition assessments are used to monitor the effectiveness of the Northwest Forest Plan.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The laboratory will use their standard operating procedures, based on USGS NAWQA guidelines. The procedure should consist of:
1.	Separating macroinvertebrates from the sand and other inorganic particles in the sample using a sieve (maximum size 500 µm). 
2.	Systematically subsampling the sample until a minimum of 500 organisms are removed from the sample and for taxonomic identification and enumeration.
3.	Conducting a brief search (10 minutes) of the remaining sample for large or rare taxa.
4.	Identify and count the organisms in the sample. The following organisms should not be included in the results:
a.	Damaged or immature organisms 
b.	Molt skins (exuvia)
c.	Adult insects (except for water-dwelling adults such as coleopterans and hemipterans)
d.	Terrestrial invertebrates
e.	Empty snail shells
f.	Zooplankton
g.	Eggs
5.	Insects should be identified to species, except for Chironomids, which will be identified to family. Other organisms should be identified to family, if possible, according to the laboratory’s standard procedure.
6.	The laboratory will use their established quality control procedures.
7.	New or unusual species, species found outside their known range of distribution, or other specimens of interest may be archived by the laboratory.
8.	Data will be entered into database.
9.	The laboratory will return electronic data files to the government, which include taxa lists, taxa counts, and calculated metric values. The contractor will coordinate with the monitoring program’s database coordinator for file formats and other details.
10.	The laboratory will dispose of the samples upon completion and the analysis and return all sample jars to the government.
11.	All work should be completed by April 1, 2007.

All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to be considered for award.     Information on the CCR registration process can be found on the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.     Information on the ORCA registration process can be found at https://orca.bpn.gov/
David Hallen is the Contracting Officer for this project.     The estimated Issue Date for this Request for Quotation in FBO is April 22, 2006 and the estimated closing date is May 8, 2006, COB.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Tharp, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2092
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Procedures, the U.S. EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) requires a contractor to provide Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Consulting Services for evaluation of a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)/Exhaust Flow Monitor (EFM)/Micro-Proportional Dilution System (MPS), Sunset OC/EC Analyzer, and Interpretation of Existing Field Data produced by these instruments in EPA projects.   EPA has recognized the need for on-board  vehicle exhaust particulate mass (PM) emissions measurement.  Recent compliance actions against vehicle and engine manufacturers have demonstrated that mobile engine-powered equipment can be configured to emit low emissions under EPA test conditions, yet under "real-world" operating conditions, the  equipment can emit 2 to 3 times EPA limits.  Furthermore, EPA needs real-world PM emissions data to create realistic air-shed models of mobile source emissions.  The National Academy of Sciences recently indicated that EPA must collect more real-world data in order to more accurately predict the  effects of its own emissions regulations. To address these requirements, EPA is developing methods to continuously monitor vehicle exhaust PM emissions.  EPA has identified a QCM/EFM/MPS and the Sunset OC/EC Analyzer as an on-board vehicle exhaust dilution system and PM monitor.  Specifically, EPA  is interested in determining performance at PM levels typical of both diesel and gasoline engines operated under the proposed 2007 regulations. The contractor shall (1) Be an educated resource on QCM instruments and data with an emphasis on QA/QC protocols.  Data reduction of QCM data from a  Kansas City emissions study is complete and has been provided in draft form to EPA for analysis. The contractor shall address questions that may arise concerning interpretation of the data and QA procedures for the data;   (2) Consult on implementation of the on-board QCM/EFM/MPS systems for both  laboratory tests and upcoming field tests of Heavy Duty vehicles.  The QCM/EFM/MPS meets the ISO standard for partial flow dilution systems under transient test conditions (ISO 16183). EPA needs an experienced person familiar with using a QCM/EFM/MPS system for both laboratory and on-board tests  with a vision toward developing an EPA transient test standard. This task may be accomplished with chassis-dyno tests at the EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL).  However, it is most likely to be accomplished in conjunction with an upcoming study of partial flow diluters and  heavy duty vehicle tests at Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) in San Antonio, TX.  The contractor shall also provide consultation on set-up and operation for both locations. The consultant shall also consult with the designer on the required post-processor program for the data; (3) The  QCM/EFM/MPS prototype system includes a filter sampling system that complements the real-time operation of the QCM. In order to use this system to confirm QCM results, and provide a tool for vehicle certification, the systems must be equivalent. To determine equivalency, the contractor shall  conduct a separate study; (4) Consult with EPA on the results of a temperature dependency test performed on the Kansas City study reference vehicles using both the QCM cart and the QCM/EFM/MPS.  The temperature dependency tests were performed using both the QCM cart and the QCM/EFM/MPS. The  resulting data on PM emissions came directly from the tail pipe through the CVS. To be effective the consultant shall consult with both the designer of the system and the people involved in the implementation of the system; and (5) Consult with EPA on use and interpretation of carbon analysis using  the Sunset OC/EC analyzer.  As part of the EPA off-road initiative, small engine tests require coarse hydrocarbon/elemental carbon speciation provided by OC/EC analysis. Operation of the Sunset OC/EC analyzer is straight-forward, but interpretation of the data is difficult. The contractor shall  consult with EPA on the Sunset OC/EC analyzer and interpretation of data. This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 541690 with a size standard of $6,500,000.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  Any responsible source believing itself capable of  providing the required Consulting Services may submit a fixed-rate proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be posted on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ approximately 15 days after electronic posting of this  synopsis.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  See Note 1

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division,  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Coherent, Inc. of Santa Clara, CA, for the upgrade of an Existing Coherent Laser, the Mira 900P.  

This requirement is for the purchase of a Coherent, Inc. Mira 900P, Ti:S laser system with Synchro-Lock cavity.

The system being ordered is an upgrade to an existing laser system originally purchased from Coherent Laser Group.  This laser light source will be used in the development of a Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering Optical Microscope.  

To increase the stability and useable spectral coverage of a Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering, optical microscope, NIST 
requires a matched Laser source that is a direct upgrade for the existing Laser system.   

Coherent Laser Group’s Mira 900P, Ti:S laser system with Synchro-Lock cavity length control will be locked (same rep rate and phase) to NIST’s existing Mira 900P’s internal crystal oscillator frequency.  To achieve the necessary, high fidelity lock across a broad wavelength coverage (705 nm to 980nm) and to take full advantage of the pre-existing wavelength optimization servos, matched Ti:S oscillators are required. 

Sole source determination is based on the following:  The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  Coherent has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to Coherent.  Coherent has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide this upgrade.   

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 21, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This antenna is  made specifically for the purpose of conducting Environmental effects Radiation  on various test items for E3 certification. Amplifier Research is the only  manufacturer of this specialized type of measurement instrument that meets our  criteria. The antenna is portable and lightweight which makes it easy to move  to different location when necessary. It also generates high power which is  needed to produce the necessary field strength to meet MIL-STD-464A criteria.  HERO testing per MIL-STD-464A evaluation is part of the E3 Teamâ€™s mission and  without this working unit, our mission cannot be accomplished.

<ARCHDATE>10212006
<CONTACT>Stephen Sandager, Contracting Officer, 505-845-4771, ssandager@doeal.gov;Douglas Bergevin, Contract Specialist, 505-845-5204, DBergevin@doeal.gov
<DESC>DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATION, AND ENGINEERING (DICCE) SERVICES, DE-RP52-06NA26990.  Proposal Disallowed Reason:  This is a sources sought announcement -- NOT a request for proposals. Description:  This is a sources sought "re-synopsis" for Design, Integration, Construction, Communication, and Engineering (DICCE) services.  The "re-synopsis" provides an up-to-date description of the DICCE services. The original synopsis was posted on September 6, 2005. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) seeks qualified small businesses, small business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small business capable of performing Design, Integration, Construction, Communications, and Engineering (DICCE) services for the Second Line of Defense (SLD) Program.  The SLD Program is comprised of two major elements:  The Core Program and the Megaports Initiative.  The Core Program provides equipment at land border crossings, airports, and feeder seaports while the Megaports Initiative focuses on large international container seaports.  SLD provides commercially available radiation detection portal monitors, communications systems, and handheld devices to assist local officials with detection and deterrence of illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive material, thereby reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation and terrorism.  The objective of this procurement is to design and install sustainable radiation detection and communication systems at selected international border crossings, airports and seaports throughout the world.  The focus is on the integration activities that are needed for the development and deployment of radiation detection and communication systems that are robust, are cost effective, will not disrupt port or customs operations, that can be adjusted for the unique needs of a specific application and that are easy to use, configure and maintain. Under the authority of agreements with the host countries, the SLD program intends to install equipment in up to 40 Megaports and at several hundred transit sites in over 30 foreign countries during the term of the DICCE contract.  The countries under consideration by the SLD program include countries in the Former Soviet Union, Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and other regions to be determined.  In the event SLD is able to obtain timely agreements in all planned locations and pursues a strategy that includes all services at each site, the rough order of magnitude for all work under this notice is in the four to five hundred million dollar ($400 - $500M) range.  All work is dependent upon written agreement with the host government.  The Government makes no commitment or assurance that the full magnitude of work will ultimately be ordered. The SLD Program works closely with host government officials, National Laboratories, other U.S. government agencies, and private contractors to successfully carry out the SLD mission.  The DICCE contractor will be a major contributor to the overall SLD team effort and will be required to work closely with and support all team members.  The DICCE contractor will be required to perform DICCE services in a variety of environments and under diverse conditions and in diverse cultural settings. Program experience has shown that integrating the design, construction and communications effort is critical to meeting program cost and schedule requirements, and minimizes disruption to local port and border operations. An integrating contractor is necessary to lead these efforts and will be responsible for ensuring all design requirements, contractor furnished equipment, government furnished equipment, construction materials, in-country contracting and construction are coordinated and completed as required. SLD strongly encourages the DICCE contractor to subcontract with local construction firms for the installation of the SLD systems. A cost-reimbursement form of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, with a five-year ordering period, is contemplated.  Award by April, 2007 is planned. Services Sought: Design Services:  Provide complete and certified architectural and engineering design services. â€¢ Installation designs for radiation detection equipment, video, motion, and security systems â€¢ Buildings and structures to house alarm station and emergency centers â€¢ Site access, boundary and perimeter control systems for seaports, airports, border crossings â€“ pedestrians, vehicles, and trains â€¢ Communication systems that include microwave, web based communications, fiber optics, cable and radio-frequency systems â€¢ Training centers, test, maintenance and repair facilities Integration Services: â€¢ Coordinate with third parties and Government Furnished Equipment contractors on equipment specifications, deliveries, and installation requirements â€¢ Coordinate with host country representatives on design and construction activities to ensure a seamless implementation process â€¢ Ensure all construction and installation activities have been accomplished. Construction Services:  Working in conjunction with U.S. and host country contractors, provide facility construction, sensor system installation, communication system installation, landscaping, asbestos and lead abatement, utility system upgrades such as water (portable and fire), telephone/computer systems (other communications), and emergency power. Communication Services:  Provide communications systems that collect, store, and display data received from the radiation monitoring locations.  The data includes radiation monitor data, video and user data entries.  The systems may include intra-site communications between computing systems(s) and the portal and handheld detectors. The SLD architecture is made up of several system elements.  Not all ports or countries will require each of these elements, and some elements may need to be modified to operate under site-specific conditions.  The elements may include: â€¢ Local Alarm Station (LAS) â€¢ Central Alarm Station (CAS) â€¢ Mother CAS  (connects two or more CASs) â€¢ Regional Center â€¢ National Center Engineering Services:  Provide specialized expertise and engineering services required for design and construction activities at SLD transit sites and Megaports, and in support of SLD mission requirements. Logistics Services: As the integrating contractor, the DICCE contractor shall provide logistical support as necessary for in-country construction. Logistics services may include but are not limited to transportation, translation, and interpretation services. Maintenance and Training:  The DICCE contractor may be required to provide limited maintenance and repair of equipment during construction and up to equipment turn over.  The DICCE Contractor will support training on equipment operation and maintenance at the time of equipment turnover.  Long term maintenance and in depth radiation detection training will generally be the responsibility of others.

Requested Information: Interested parties are asked to submit by April 21, 2006 a Statement of Capability (SOC) to NNSA using the format that follows: A.

Identify business type:  Small Business (Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Woman-Owned Business, Veteran-Owned Business, etc.).     2.  If two or more business concerns plan a joint venture or teaming arrangement, identify each company.     3.  A statement as to whether your company meets the $31M size standard under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990. C.  Demonstrated Capability     1.  Provide a narrative that demonstrates the companyâ€™s capability to perform the requirements contained in the draft SOW for NNSA.  In addition, provide a statement describing how your company might propose to perform the percentage of work specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14(b)(3) -- (15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials).  If two or more business concerns have formed a joint venture or teaming arrangement, identify the demonstrated capabilities of each business to perform the work described in the Services Sought section above and the roles and responsibilities of each business in the accomplishment of the requirements.     2.  Provide a summary of your company experience and past performance within the last 5 years as it relates to complex international design, construction and integrating engineering services. D.  Past Performance.  Each company experience summary should include (a) name of project, (b) brief description of project, (c) contract or project number, (d) client/customer point of contact (name, address, phone), (e) dollar value of the contract/project, (f) period of performance of contract/project, (g) relevance of contract/project to NNSA's requirements described above, and (h) past performance rating demonstrating the capability of the firm(s) to successfully perform the work described in the Services Sought section above. Large businesses need not respond to this announcement.  SOCs shall not exceed 20 letter-size (8.5x11) pages, double-spaced, using 12-point font; pages in excess of the specified limit will not be reviewed.  SOCs submitted in response to this announcement may be used as a basis for future solicitations. Firms responding to the previous DICCE synopsis, dated September 6, 2005, are encouraged to review their original response as it applies to the information provided here. Firms need not, but may at their option, submit a new, superseding statement of capability and experience in response to this synopsis. In addition to the information requested as part of the SOCs, NNSA requests frank and constructive industry comment on the acquisition approach outlined in this synopsis (comments should be limited to three (3) pages, in addition to the 20-page SOC page limitation).  The above Services Sought are presently performed under two separate contracts for design/construction and communications.  The Government has not identified factors that would make it likely that this acquisition is unsuitable for award to a small business concern.  However, comment and rationale are requested concerning whether the combined scope of the two contracts for design/construction and communications services could constitute "bundling" as defined at FAR 2.101.  Comment and rationale should specifically explain how any of the factors at FAR 2.101 impact the suitability of this acquisition to be awarded to a small business concern. Additional Information: This announcement is being used to determine whether sufficient small business interest and capability exist to set this acquisition aside for Small Business (e.g., small business, HUBZone small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business) or conduct a competitive 8(a) acquisition. NNSA is a strong advocate for the small business community.  Interested small businesses, small business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  This notice is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  NNSA may pursue additional methods of identifying suitable approaches and qualified vendors for this work.  Interested parties are strongly encouraged to monitor this site for further information on this action.  All notices will be posted on DOE E-Center and on FedBizOpps. Responses must be received through the IIPS website (http://e-center.doe.gov/) or may be e-mailed to Douglas Bergevin at DBergevin@doeal.gov.  Assistance with IIPS is available in the IIPS Users Guide on-line help document, available at that same website.  Only electronic copies of the SOC will be accepted.

Indicate the firm’s present workload and projected workload with a plan and schedule to accomplish the work, including 24 hour response services in urgent cases. 

(5) Quality Control Program - Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to assess technical accuracy in plans, studies and reports, to assure overall coordination between engineering and technical disciplines, their means of ensuring quality services from their subcontractors, ability of laboratories, whether internal or subcontracted, to meet all applicable federal, state, and local as well as Navy/DoD standards; and to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans, specifications and reports.

(6) Firm’s location in the general geographical area of the contract and knowledge of localities (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).  Firms will be evaluated on their proximity and familiarity with respect to the general geographical area of the contract, with emphasis on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic AOR.

(7) Volume of Work. Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD with the objective of affecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources in support of the Targets and Countermeasures Directorate (MDA/DET).  MDA/DET is conducting market research to identify Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small Businesses (SB) that have prior experience or the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate their capability to develop, fabricate, maintain, integrate and test missile systems and instrumentation packages, and provide launch services for low fidelity ballistic missile targets to demonstrate the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) asset readiness for major tests, the cost of which typically ranges from $250,000 to $2 Million, dependent upon complexity.  Systems will support multiple customers at different ranges with varying missile configurations.  The missile/test requirement includes:
                                                                 
1)	Maximum use of excess government furnished property (GFP) rocket motors along with existing hardware such as aft skirts and fin sets and use existing mature technology to fabricate and successfully launch the test missiles. If, after analysis of requirements and considering available GFP motors and other assets, it is determined that these assets can not meet requirements, the contractor would make a recommendation for commercial motor(s) as alternative solutions. 
2)	Requested missiles will normally be flown unguided and without a flight termination system (FTS) from rail launchers at a number of different launch sites.  
3)	A number of separation planes on the mission/test article based on the number of rocket motors.
4)	Separation systems to reduce tip off rates.
5)	Possible requirements for the encryption of data.
6)	Articles in the field of regard to include the nose cone, attitude control/payload section, items ejected as payload, and spent rocket motor(s).  
7)	Attitude control/payload section with or without a spent rocket motor attached could be required to hold attitude, tumble, roll, ordnance initiation devices, etc. at prescribed mission times or altitudes.  
8)	Selected sections such as the nose cone and attitude control/payload section would usually require an instrumentation and telemetry system able to provide position, velocity, roll rate, and attitude data for collection
9)	Additional instrumentation in the form of pressure transducers, thermal couples, etc. may be required based on specific mission needs.  
                                                                 
All efforts would be closely coordinated with the government and their selected support contractors to accomplish mission objectives.  
                                                                 
This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify those HBCUs, MIs, and SBs that have the ability to meet the above requirements.  This RFI does not in any way constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and as such, shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for proposal preparation costs supporting submission of a response to this RFI.  Sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy these requirements are invited to submit a White Paper (no more than 5 pages), including the name of the organization, point of contact, disclosure of HBCU/MI/Small Business status, and information in relation to the following review criteria: (1), The prime contractor must be a United States corporation, educational, or business entity, (2) Technical approach or concept to manufacturing low cost fidelity targets, (3) Relevant experience with low cost fidelity targets, and (4) Relevant personnel for target manufacturing.  It is anticipated that government facilities may be furnished for the purpose of integration, assembly, test, storage and limited office space; however, in the event that government facilities are not available, your white paper should also include the proposed place of performance for this requirement and if the proposed facility is owend/leased/or to be obtained after award.  Personnel must possess a Secret security clearance; Secret manufacturing facilities are preferred.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this Market Research shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.  Responses to this notice must be received on or before April 13, 2006, electronically to the points of contact listed below or via mail to Missile Defense Agency, ATTN: MDA/DACT – MaryKathryn Robinson, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-7100.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Requests for additional information and/or responses shall be forwarded to Ms. MaryKathryn Robinson, Contract Specialist, at marykathryn.robinson@mda.mil.  Based on responses received, any future requirement may be considered for an HBCU/MI set-aside under DFARS Part 26 or Small Business set-aside under FAR Part 19.

Release Date:	4/7/2006
Response Due Date: 4/21/2006, 4:00pm
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
Issuing Institute or Center: Office of the Chief IT Architect (OCITA)
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its Institutes or Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the NIH understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) solutions, tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI.  NIH will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential technical standards to be included in its enterprise technical architecture.

NIH welcomes comments from all interested parties on each or all of the questions contained in this RFI.  NIH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIH’s use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  

Description of Objective
NIH seeks information on available Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) technologies that support protocols for safely and reliably transmitting messages or data between information systems as well as a system-programming interface to invoke the communication service.

Description of Environment
NIH information systems currently use multiple application integration mechanisms for sharing data between applications.  Which mechanism is used is based on the specific integration scenario and systems involved.   

Many of NIH’s systems currently use message-oriented middleware that is incorporated into application server products including Java Messaging Service (JMS) providers incorporated into J2EE containers and Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ).  Additionally, NIH has acquired TIBCO BusinessWorks as its strategic Integration Broker Suite and will be leveraging its messaging capabilities in addition to those provided by other products.

Technologies of interest to the NIH are capable of the following:

1.	Program-to-program (loosely coupled communication services for intra-application and inter-application (i.e. integration) purposes
2.	"Store-and-forward" (queuing)
3.	Guaranteed delivery
4.	Broad platform support (run on many operating systems) 
5.	Subject-based addressing (for example, publish-and-subscribe)
6.	Securing messaging capabilities including authentication, nonrepudiation, and encryption.

Description of Evaluation Criteria:
In order to support its evaluation and selection of enterprise-wide technical standards for application integration, the NIH seeks information on available technologies within the MOM technical domain.  For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as middleware products supporting asynchronous messaging between systems including both queuing and publish-subscribe capabilities.  

The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will provide the NIH with important decision support information in its evaluation.  NIH will base the selection of its technical standards on the following evaluation criteria:

•	Existing NIH installed base – NIH experience with the technology and the use and adoption of the standard throughout NIH.
•	Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems  – any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
•	Maintainability/supportability – the effort and specialized skill sets required to support a technology standard.
•	Cost – estimated total cost of ownership (based on market research statistics and independent research opinions).
•	Strategic value – evaluates the breadth of product capabilities beyond the core requirement, and the extent to which these capabilities can be leveraged by NIH to enhance the value of NIH’s investment in the product.
•	Security – the ability and/or effectiveness and fit of the technology within the NIH security environment.
•	Vendor viability  – the health of the product vendor in terms of its stability, projected longevity, and likelihood it will exist in the future to support the product and later versions of the product.
•	Industrial installed base – the use and adoption of the standard throughout industry in general (both commercial and public enterprises).
•	Product Life cycle – evaluates the expected time the product will be in use and supported by the vendor and the ability to maintain currency of its functionality and operation.  A longer life cycle is desirable from a training and hardware investment perspectives.
•	Availability – the availability, failover and performance of the technology as it relates to server uptime, client uptime and network uptime.
•	Reliability – the extent to which the messaging capabilities of the technology are reliable including the guaranteed delivery of messages once and only once.
•	Performance – evaluates the throughput of the messaging services in terms of the volume and size of messages processed per unit time based on the support infrastructure.
•	Features and Functionality – the capabilities provided by the product as reflected in responses to this RFI.  
•	Usability and Accessibility – the usability and accessibility of the product and services according to existing federal guidelines and established best practices. 
•	Implementation Effort and Complexity – The level of effort and complexity associated with the implementation of the product in a production environment.
It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIH’s overall evaluation.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** 
The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medicine for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the  Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was assigned the responsibility for the establishment of surge capacity, advanced development, , and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as diagnostics, vaccines  and antiviral drugs that may be used to diagnosis, contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP.   

***DESCRIPTION*** 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. The Office of Research and Development  Coordination of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness  has an interest in identifying potential platforms, technologies, methods, assays and reagents that can be applied to the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of influenza virus infections and disease. The use of appropriate diagnostic assays and equipment during influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may provide for more timely and accurate detection of influenza outbreaks and thus delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the increased load that will be placed on the healthcare system. Early detection of influenza by the use of appropriate tests will allow for  the determination of the parameters of the pandemic in sufficient time to provide effective disease central measures. Rapid, accurate high throughput laboratory bench systems and portable low cost point of care (POC) systems are both needed to identify and characterize the outbreak as quickly as possible and to provide timely data and information  to guide and monitor effective response measures. Responses to this RFI may address either or both of these areas (High throughput on POC) of identified interest but should clearly indicate which area of need is being addressed in the response. 

Rapid diagnostics for influenza viruses currently lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity and timeliness of results to provide clinically relevant information.  Diagnostic platforms and assays for influenza and influenza like illnesses are needed to provide timely diagnostic information to health care providers in the face of an emerging pandemic. Information is being sought on assays, methods and platforms that may meet near term and long-term program needs. 


	The responses should address the following issues:

•	Sensitivity-relative to culture of clinically significant levels of virus
10 to 106 TC/DO/ML if a specified influenza A virus strain
•	Specificity- ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of a ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus.
•	Sample handling and preparation
•	Throughput capacity.
•	Platform flexibility/adaptability.
•	Operational simplicity.
•	Portability.
•	Non-Cross Reactivity-ability to detect influenza virus in presence of [illegible] and pathogenic microorganisms.
•	Estimates of cost factors.

HHS will use information obtained by this RFI in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Please submit information in the following format:
1)	Name of Submitter
2)	Address of Submitter
3)	Name of Device, Assay or technology
4)	Technical / Method Summary
5)	Device specifications
6)	Performance Summary including any supportive data
7)	Clinical samples tested to date
8)	Viral strains tested to date
9)	Points of Contact
10)	Bibliography and/or References

Information must be submitted by April 28, 2006. Responses should be limited to 20 pages, 12 Font, Times Roman,  single space, one sided or equivalent in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Jeff Miller, Contract Specialist, phone 770-488-2651, e-mail afx2@cdc.gov.  Please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOURGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is in support of a market survey being conducted by the USAF Air Traffic Control And Landing Systems, ATCALS, program office to determine the existence of potential sources capable of providing an alternative design for the AN/GPN-22 POTENTIOMETER.  This effort will provide modification designs for the AN/GPN-22 Precision Approach Radar alignment process.  The alignment of the AN/GPN-22 precision approach radar antenna is performed through a simple feedback circuit using discrete potentiometers (NSN 5905-00-517-9412).  The current potentiometer circuit is used to align the antenna with up to four runways.  Initially, the technician manually aligns the antenna.  Once the manual alignment is complete, then the antenna can automatically be moved.  During the manual alignment, a reflector is set up on each runway.  To align the antenna, the technician looks through the telescope on the antenna. The technician then rotates the antenna until the reflector is centered in the telescope.  An electric motor is used to rotate the antenna.  Varying voltages control which “step” the motor is set to.  This allows for rotation of the antenna to very precise angles controlled by an input voltage.  When the technician “sees” the reflector in the telescope, then he records the voltage needed at that particular angle.  The technician then repeats this process for each runway needed.  The potentiometers are used to control the output voltage going to the motor.  This allows for automatic alignment of the antenna by selecting one of the four potentiometers.  An alternative design would remove, as a minimum, the noted discrete potentiometers and maximize the ease of use in the antenna alignment procedure.  As noted above, the alignment procedure records the voltage of the motor for a particular runway (up to four).  When the technician selects one of four runways, the recorded voltage for that runway is sent to the motor.  The voltage determines the “step” of the motor, which in turn, controls the angle of the antenna. The alternative design shall be modular to facilitate maintenance and logistics support.  The use of mature, commercial off-the-shelf technology is encouraged to minimize cost and program risk.  Proposed solutions must be integrated into existing hardware and operate within the temperature range of -32 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.  Digital or analog designs may be proposed.  All proposed designs must meet the requirements of Mil-Std-188-124.  Proposed solutions shall be submitted in a Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or Adobe file format.  Preliminary drawings or schematics must be provided to illustrate the proposed design solution.  A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule estimate to design, build, and test a prototype is also mandatory.  The submittal of engineering test data is encouraged to assist the government evaluate the maturity of proposed design solutions.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT request.  This synopsis request is in support of a market survey to determine the existence of potential sources only.

<DESC>Description

This requirement is for one year interim service and possible option to continue for two additional years based on satisfactory performance.  This requirement calls for lease and rental of electric generators and ancillary power distribution system to meet the maximum power requirements of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activities where grid based power is inadequate or not available.  This requirement is not a Request for Proposal, but a survey to locate sources capable of providing all necessary engineering expertise, qualified personnel, equipment, fuel, and operation and maintenance to ensure continuous uninterrupted supply of electric power.    

The FEMA Headquarters Logistics has a requirement for standby-by contract sources for critical disaster commodities and professional program support services (for multiple programs) that will enable FEMA to proactively support the logistical emergency necessities associated with natural and man-made disasters. 
The Contractor will be asked to provide mobile generator support to fulfill the requirements of FEMA Headquarters and Regional Logistics for logistics support services needed to respond to Presidential-declared emergencies within the United States and its territories and possessions.  The Contractor also may be used to provide such services in emergencies not declared by Presidential decree.  These services are in support of disaster recovery assistance requirements resulting from hurricane devastation, and/or potential future disasters.  

FEMA is looking for firm(s) that can provide up to 3 Mega Watts of mobile power generation capability within 72 hours of notice to proceed.   The contractor must be capable of providing the power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and assign qualified personnel to respond within one hour to an order for service or request for assistance.  The generator contractor must be willing to receive management/oversight guidance from USACE and/or a FEMA designated on-site Project Officer/Officer in Charge in addition to COTR and CO.  Following sections provide more details and specific support services to be provided by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall be fully responsible for performing one or all of the specific tasks and deliverables described below.
  
Generator sizing from 3000watts thru 3MGW, 
Generators should be 3-phased 
Fitted with orbital gel batteries to minimize hazardous materials 
Generators should have a fuel line quick disconnects to be compatible with our generator inventory, which is the compatibility of a generator unit with a respective fuel tank.  The quick disconnects allow a generator unit to use a variety of fuel tanks (larger/smaller) and not depend necessarily on one specific tank.  Sometimes you have to work with whatever fuel tank is available.  The primary reason for the fuel line quick disconnects is to facilitate handling and installation/de-installation of a generator unit and its accompanying fuel tank.  The entire FEMA generator inventory is equipped with fuel quick disconnects. 
Generators should be fitted with lifting aids such as forklift stirrups and/or lifting eye for crane/cherry picker lift capability.  Trying to handle, maneuver, install/de-install a generator without the forklift stirrups and or lifting eye usually results in physical damage to the generator.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and others to implement improved earthquake-resistant design guidance for building codes and standards for new and existing buildings, structures, and lifelines.  Public Law 108-360 assigns NIST significant new R&D responsibilities to close the research-to-implementation gap and accelerate the use of new earthquake risk mitigation technologies based on the earth sciences and engineering knowledge developed through NEHRP efforts.  NEHRP intends to strengthen program effectiveness by facilitating implementation of earthquake risk mitigation measures, and build and maintain effective partnerships with NEHRP program agencies and stakeholders in industry, academia and government.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($5 million) which have the capability to establish an Innovations Clearinghouse that will be a database-driven, Internet-accessible, public clearinghouse of innovations in health service delivery. The Innovations Clearinghouse will facilitate collection of innovative health service practices and present them in a standardized format accompanied by expert commentary; promote their dissemination, replication, adaptation, and use; and, foster innovation in the U.S. health care service industry. While there are IT components in this project, this is not an IT requirement.  The project will be content driven supported by information technology.

This project will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, publish, update and archive innovations (in health service delivery), associated tools and lessons learned. The innovations will be entered and stored in a Contractor-constructed database; they will be posted to a Web site the Contractor will design, deploy and maintain for this project. Related tasks include establishment of an expert panel and an editorial board, development of criteria that innovative health service delivery practices must meet to be included in the Clearinghouse, and creation of a standardized template to capture innovations’ attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouse on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of the inclusion criteria and standardized template. The Web site will be user-centered and will meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using an approved domain, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records. In addition, online and offline opportunities for learning and networking among Innovations Clearinghouse users will be a component of this project. AHRQ’s QualityTools database and Web site (www.qualitytools.ahrq.gov) will become the responsibility of the Innovations Clearinghouse Contractor.  Eventually, the QualityTools database will be presented through the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site. 

Sources must demonstrate an understanding of and expertise in health service delivery innovation and change; implementation of evidence-based health practices; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategy implementation and evaluation; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, working with expert panels and editorial boards.  Sources must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as operationalizing health service delivery innovation and change; implementing and evaluating heath care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategies; educating and training adult professionals; evaluating and implementing evidence-based clinical information; constructing large relational databases; developing clinically-related classification schemes; and developing Web sites.  A  PMI–certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as and demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  
 Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to Mary Haines, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Rd, Rockville, Maryland 20850, no later than 2:00 pm eastern standard time, on April 14, 2006.  Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.  Capability statements should be submitted in an original and two (2) copies.

<SUBJECT>F -- HECETA THINNING STUDY
<DESC>The Forest Service previously announced in Fedbizopps a pre-solicitation conference for the Heceta Thinning Study.  This conference was held as announced on March 31, 2006.

At that conference, the Forest Service announced that a pre-solicitation synopsis might appear as early as the next week (April 3 - 7).  This announcement informs interested parties that the pre-solicitation synopsis will be delayed for a short time, perhaps for one to two weeks.

The Forest Service has tentatively decided that the optional harvesting and timber units will not be included in the solicitation.  The Forest Service has also re-visited the matter of bonding requirements, and has tentatively determined that bonds for 100% of the construction price will not be needed.  Rather, the Forest Service contemplates that performance and payment bonds of $90,000 will be adequate to protect the Government's interests.  These bonds will cover the entire contract, including the construction, harvesting service, and timber removal.

The Heceta Thinning Study acquisition is planned as a stewardship contract pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 2104.  It includes a construction and service component, where the Government will pay a contractor for the construction and service work; and a timber removal component.  The construction and service component includes the construction or reconditioning of gravel roads and the harvesting (felling and yarding) of selected young-growth timber in two timber units in preparation for a long-term site study by the Forest Service Laboratory.  The value of the timber or other forest products removed from Forest Service lands will be an offset against the cost of the construction and service payments.

Interested parties are invited to share their thoughts on the conduct of the Heceta Thinning Study acquisition with the contracting officer.  Interested parties that contemplate submitting a proposal are invited to notify the contracting officer of their intentions without delay.

(b) The interior walls (5/8” Type X gypsum drywall with scrubable flat acrylic latex finish) and lay in acoustical ceiling finishes will be required to resist normal laboratory wear and tear and will be matte finish so as not to reflect laser light. (c) All room hardware must also be matte finish so as not to reflect laser light.
Noise level: The walls shall be acoustically treated as necessary to reduce Wind Tunnel fan and motor noise intrusion by a minimum of 20 dBA. It shall also minimize acoustical reflection within the room. The fan and motor will produce a sound pressure level of approximately 95 dBA and will be located less than 2 feet from the Control Room wall.
Heating and Cooling: (a) The HVAC unit will be 208/220 VAC powered, mounted in the SW wall above either the door or the Wind Tunnel duct. Condensate removal must be considered if the unit is mounted over or near the door. If there isn’t sufficient mounting area in these locations, the roof may be considered but must be approved by the University. 
(b) Heating and cooling shall be such that a temperature of 70 +/- 5 degrees Fahrenheit can be maintained at all times and can be powered off when not in use. Exterior temperatures can vary from 30 degrees in the winter to as high as 110 degrees in the summer. Heat loading from 20 persons, 10 computers, lighting, etc. shall be considered in the design. Consideration also needed for approximately 100 degree (maximum) Wind Tunnel air flowing through the section of wind tunnel duct passing through the control room. The portion of the duct passing through the room will be constructed of ~400 sq ft of 1/4” thick steel plate and ~100 sq ft of 3/4” thick Lexan sheet. Airflow will be stopped and this duct will be opened to the room interior approximately once every 30 minutes. The unit will need to be capable of compensating for the temperature change within 10 minutes.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Contractor shall provide instruction on hand-to-hand combative training to Soldiers of the 10 SFG(A)at Fort Carson, CO, for a 12-month period beginning May 01, 2006 to April 30, 2007 with o ne option year beginning May 01, 2007 through April 30, 2008. The desired end result is for the Soldiers assigned to the 10 SFG(A) to develop an offensive, non-sport fighting, instinctive hand-to-hand skill set. This training will not be primarily defensiv e in nature and will be an extreme form of physical and environmental domination enabling Soldiers to gain a decisive advantage against multiple assailants. The instruction for 18 Series Soldiers will focus on providing a predetermined skill set in which t hese Soldiers will be able to provide train-the-trainer expertise to their unit personnel.  Additionally support Soldiers assigned to the 10 SFG(A)will be offered this training to obtain a survival fighting skill set to enhance overall survivability and unit readiness. Lethal, skeletal breaking and mechanical compliance techniques will be instructed. The program of instruction will provide a basic, intermediate and advanced skill set. The intermediate and advanced sections of training will provide for mis sion related training and mission related scenarios. Techniques taught in the basic course must be applicable and used as a foundation for the advanced course. All skill sets instructed must be executable in full ballistic and protective equipment and appl y to combat and non-combat environments. Techniques must be executable when the Soldier is fatigued and operates in limited visibility. All students will receive instruction blocks in both basic and intermediate skill set before instruction in advanced tec hniques. The contractor will coordinate during the last week of each month directly with unit training sections to develop a monthly hand-to-hand combative training plan. This developed training plan will be provided to the Contracting Officer Representati ve(COR)overseeing the contract no later than the second working day of each month for the same month. Class times will be scheduled between the hours of 0600-1500 hours, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Training will occur in facilities p rovided by the government. Class sizes will range from 6 to 25 participants per class. Maximum participants in one year will not exceed 600. The contractor is required to provide testing of students before they will be permitted to advance to the next phas e of training. The contractor will provide the COR a written test and evaluation plan. The contractor will maintain record of student performance for view by the COR and the command. ACCREDITATION: Instructors shall possess a minimum of 5th degree Black Be lt through an international Martial Arts Federation in the respective Art. This ranking substantiates the instructors advanced technical ability and demonstrated knowledge. A minimum of 5th degree black belt in KENPO is preferred. KENPO is the martial art  identified by the 10 SFG(A)that most closely meets the overall technique criteria.  INSTRUCTIONAL EXPERIENCE: Contractor instructors are required to be an occupational Martial Arts Instructor. This requirement ensures the instructor competence in translat ing his or her physical skills into a learnable skill set for a large and diverse demographic. This is a critical requirement in ensuring the instructor possesses the ability to shape training plans and techniques that meet the demands of current operation al and environmental conditions our Soldiers face. The 10 SFG(A)does not have the time or desire to train instructors in how to teach techniques and build scena rios to prepare our Soldiers for current combat realities. OPERATIONAL SECURITY: Instructor(s) will be required to undergo a National Agency Check(NAC), receive a favorable NAC rating and sign a non-disclosure statement.  The contractor will not be allowed  to use any association with the 10 SFG(A) or Army Special Forces in any advertisement. REQUIRED TECHNIQUES: The 10 SFG(A) COR will evaluate the instructors ability to perform all required hand-to-hand fighting system techniques, mission focus applicabili ty and instructional capacity. At the completion of each course each Soldier will be instructed and required to demonstrate(contractor maintains written test/evaluations)a fundamental skill set comprised of: (a)Disarming assailant of knives, pistol and ass ault weapon from a standing and kneeling position. Techniques will allow acquisition of weapon and combine instantaneous elimination of assailant threat. (b)Retention and strikes with knives, pistols and assault weapons from standing, kneeling positions an d while the Soldier is walking. The threat must be reduced immediately both lethal and non-lethal methods are required. (c)Defensive and Offensive actions relating to hand Strikes (lethal, non-lethal application) instruction in where to strike and the resu lting effect, all hand strikes shall be applicable with the weapons retention techniques instructed. (d)Lower body quadrant kicks that break and incapacitate the threat and are performed while wearing all military equipment. They shall be performed in conf ined areas as well as open areas. (e)Fundamental kicking defense enables the Soldiers to prevent being kicked and simultaneously allows the Soldier to control the threat. (f)Breaks/Locks that are not strikes or kicks allowing the Soldier to manipulate the assailant in order to kill or subdue. The techniques must be applicable in confined spaces, work instantaneously to allow the Soldier to deal with multiple assailants. (g)Throws that allow the Soldier to eliminate a threat if attacked from behind or initia te a throw to eliminate an assailant. (h)Ground fighting instruction that allows the Soldier to instantaneously gain the advantage, if he is taken or falls to the ground, so he can immediately return to his feet and will not be exposed to multiple attacker s. The ground fighting techniques shall directly relate to the standing hand and kicking techniques to reduce the complexity of the combative system being instructed and increase the Soldier ability to immediately apply the techniques. (i)Improvised Weapon s Techniques that are offensive and defensive in nature and allow the Soldier to defend against an assailant with a stick, pipe, furniture or any thing that the Soldier could face while deployed.  Instruction should also cover the application of handcuffs or improvised handcuff devices and the use of batons against assailants. (j)Physical Conditioning instruction will also include activities to increase the Soldiers ability to apply the skills by incorporating related strength and endurance conditioning. T he Soldier will be able to demonstrate techniques, while wearing all standard Ballistic Protection Equipment, personal weapons and individual tactical gear.  All instruction will be focused on training the Soldier to remain on his feet or to regain a stand ing position in order to compensate for equipment and the potential for multiple aggressors. All techniques must be applicable in open and confined areas.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: INDIVIDUAL CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT ISSUES:  If required for training, the gover nment shall provide to the contractor military unique organizational clothing and individual equipment. Upon receipt of the clothing and equipment, the contractor shall assume responsibility and accountability of these items.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance  with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The following FAR and DFAR clauses are applicable:  52-212-1, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52,222-26, 52.222-35, 252.225-7000.   STATEMENT OF WORK Purchase\Acquisition of the REMI (Regional Economic Models, Inc.) System for Evaluation of Economic Impacts Attributable to Hurricane Katrina Consequence Analysis (IPET Task IX);  Economic Impacts (Sub-Task I) Scope of Requirement(s) ________________________________________________________________________ Introduction: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a primary participant in the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force (IPET) charged with review and evaluation of the impacts of Hurricane Katrina.  Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast in the south ern Louisiana-Mississippi region in late August 2005 and resulted in unprecedented impact(s) on the greater New Orleans area and southern coastal Alabama.  Storm conditions resulted in high winds and widespread storm surge flooding and inundation of catast rophic proportion to the affected area.  These storm effects in turn resulted in considerable property damage and long-term displacement of a significant portion of the populace and workforce, and disruption of various business activities and governmental functions. Under IPET, Ten (10) separable tasks have been identified.  Tasks I through VIII are primarily engineering-oriented (storm condition and inundation simulation modeling, physical testing of floodwall structures or components, geotechnical investigations, et c.).  Tasks IX and X involve consequence and risk analysis respectively.  Task IX involves four (4) sub-tasks structured to address economic, health and safety, social\cultural, and environmental consequences.  The sub-task for economic consequence analysi s has\is being structured to address direct economic impact or consequences in addition to indirect and induced impacts at localized, regional, and national level (to the extent practical subject to limitations of schedules, resources, and available data). A preliminary review of economic impact modeling systems has been performed and it has been learned that due to the significant nature of impact to the Gulf Coast regional economy, virtually no economic impact model is fully applicable in its standard or  off the shelf form.  This is largely attributable to the typical underlying assumption(s) or formulation of available impact models based on continuing or on-going function of a regional economy much as it has been measured or evaluated in recent history (and in the circumstance of the New Orleans area, before the storm).  Available information indicates that the changes that have occurred in terms of disruption, displacement, and forced realignment of community and business sector activities is considered  so dramatic or significant most available models simply do not apply, can not be acceptably (or cost-effectively) adapted, and therefore can not be employed to generate reasonable measure(s) of changes to regional economic relationships.  In regard to lim itations and capabilities of available impact models, corresponding research and inquiry has revealed that a select few models are applicable with some level of adjustment or adaptation to circumstances related to Katrina.  These include potentially IMPLAN , the Multi-Regional Variable Input-Output (MRVIO) modeling system developed proprietarily by and for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the multi-regional impact model system available  from Regional Economic Models, Inc. commonly known as REMI.  While the preference would be to apply at least two models to studies for analysis and iterative verification, the limitations of current schedules established as mission essential for IPET will  not accommodate the need for the minimum time resources required to adapt either IMPLAN or MRVIO.  Alternatively, the REMI model system already accommodates some or many of the features for adaptability to significant changes or impact within a regional e conomy. Requirements for Economic Impact Studies  Background The following information is provided to representatives of REMI for information concerning requirements for IPET related to impact analysis and the use of REMI, and for review concerning capabilities, and actions or recommendations for calibrating the mod el if required. As stated previously, the occurrence of Hurricane Katrina in August of 2005 resulted in unprecedented impacts on the greater New Orleans area and southern Alabama region with severe damages from high winds and widespread storm surge flooding and inundation .  These storm effects in turn resulted in considerable property damage and long-term displacement of a significant portion of the populace and workforce, and disruption of various business activities and governmental functions. Of particular concern regarding the occurrence of flooding and inundation is whether levee and floodwall systems performed in accordance with engineering design specifications relative to prevailing storm conditions.  During the course of, or immediately s ubsequent to storm conditions limited segments of the levee\floodwall system were physically compromised and breached making flood conditions more severe than would otherwise have occurred had they remained intact.  Tentatively, available information indic ates that some areas or segments of the existing levee\floodwall system may have failed under conditions for storm surge levels or elevations less than specified for design.  Following Hurricane Katrina, the Federal government has committed the U.S. Army C orps of Engineers (USACE) to fulfill two objectives or requirements: a.)  Repair or reconstruction of compromised segments of the levee\floodwall system with overall restoration of flood damage protection to that considered to be in place (and as intended by design) prior to the onslaught of storm conditions (this effort is  publicly known as Task Force Guardian [TFG]), 	and b.)  Evaluation of conditions that occurred during and after the storm (from the context of engineering and economics as appropriate) with further evaluation of risk and related consequence(s)s for future occurrence of storms (this effort is publicly known  as the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force [IPET]).     Item a, repair of the levee\floodwall system, is being undertaken within a general authority or directive identified as Task Force Guardian (TFG) which is scheduled for completion by 1 June 2006; the date for beginning of the next hurricane season after th e advent of Hurricane Katrina.  Item b, to be undertaken through authority of the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force (IPET), involves evaluation of conditions during and after the storm and evaluation of risk and consequence(s) associated with f uture storm events.  IPET has been scheduled for completion of draft or initial efforts and forwarding of associated findings by 1 June 2006 in concert with schedules for TFG.   The sub-task for economic consequence analysis has\is being structured to address direct economic impact or consequences in addition to indirect and induced impacts at localized and regional or national levels (to the extent practical subject to limitation s of schedules, resources, and available data).  Two basic scenarios for the occurrence of Katrina have been specified; I.)	economic consequences for Katrina as it transpired (i.e., with levee\floodwall physical compro mise to the extent determined applicable) and II.)	consequences associated with the occurrence of Hurricane Katrina as it happened but assuming performance of levee\floodwall features or measures as intended or designed.   A primary objective of IPET includes the ability to undertake alternative scenario analysis or assessment of risk under varying future conditions determined via Task X. Within the framework of specifications for analysis as generally described, the require ment and solicitation for modeling software herein is for the sub-task addressing economic impacts of Katrina with an emphasis for estimation and review of direct, indirect and induced or tertiary impacts at the local, regional, and national levels of infl uence to the extent that they are or can be quantified within the timeframes or schedules of IPET efforts.  Currently, local level or region of influence is defined as the central greater New Orleans area consisting of the following parishes: 	I,    Orleans Parish 	II.   St. Bernard Parish 	III.  Jefferson Parish 	IV.  Plaquemines Parish 	V.   St. Charles Parish The regional level of influence will include parishes or counties comprising a hybrid of what historically has been defined as the New Orleans BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis) Area consisting of the preceding local parishes in addition to adjacent or outl ying parishes comprising the remainder of the BEA area plus relevant counties or parishes in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama impacted either directly or indirectly by coastal surge flooding and inundation.  The third geographic level of measurement for  economic impact evaluation will be a multi-state area consisting of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and the last or highest level will be for the nation as a whole.  Summarized, the regions for REMI model compilation are provided as follows: a.)  Region I. -  Five (5) Parishes  Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, and Jefferson (as one area) b.)  Region(s) IIa., IIb., and IIc.  -  Remainder of New Orleans BEA Area (excluding Region I as described, preceding) or the area designated as subject to significant impact by the Louisiana State Hurricane Recovery Commission (totaling approximately 13 p arishes including Region I, preceding) plus two separate regions each consisting of approximately 5-12 coastal counties in two of the three following states:  Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas (with areas and\or counties or parishes to be determined and fina lized by the designated technical point of contact (POC) for USACE-IWR [listed later in the SOW] at the time of purchase or within two business days after award). c.)  Region III. -  The rest of the State of Louisiana (excluding Regions I and II.as described; as one area) d.)  Region IV. -  Multi-state area of Texas, Mississippi, Alabama (excluding I, II, and III as described; as one area) e.)  Region V. -  Rest of the United States (excluding regions I, II, III, and IV as described; as one area). General Requirements for Studies; Additional Detail The scope of studies for review of subject economic studies for Hurricane Katrina will involve economic impact analyses developed for evaluation of impacts at the local, regional and national levels to the extent such impacts are considered significant and  warrant investigation and measurement or estimation subject to available resources and information.  Direct impacts for the purposes of review will emphasize measurement for damages to structures or capital assets of both businesses and households includi ng the associated costs of disruption, loss and displacement of business activities and the supporting workforce.  Estimation of damages and impacts will be conducted to the extent possible according to five (5) general categories: I.     Private\Household Sector  (Residential Property & Households) II.    Private\Corporate Commercial-Industrial Sector  (Business) III.   Public\Governmental Secto r  (Federal, State, and Local) IV.   Private-Public Community or Public Services & Activities V.    Utilities & Infrastructure Within the context of estimation or measurement of economic value or costs, priority for efforts will be to address the measurement or estimation of economic impacts on the basis of primary or direct effects with estimations of impact to be further or comp arably measured in context of both National Economic Development (NED) and localized regional economic or developmental (RED) impacts.  A listing of some of the measurements or impacts tentatively considered applicable for evaluation across described secto rs and categories of physical assets and activities for which storm-induced damages and economic costs may or will be assessed include (subject to availability of data or information): 		Private\Household Sector - Privately-Owned Capital Asset Damages 				- Residential Structure Damages 				- Other Real Property Damages 				- Vehicle and Capital Equipment Damages 			- Residential Content Damages	     			- Lost Wages, Income, Employment 		Private-Public Community Sector 			- Damages to Schools and Educational Services 			- Damages to Hospitals and Healthcare Support Services 			- Damages to Churches and Charities or Other Non-Profit Entities 			- Damages or Impacts to Other Community Services 		Private\Commercial Sector(s) 			- Commercial Structure Damages 			- Commercial Capital Asset\Equipment Damages - Losses to Commercial Revenue Generation (business, tourism, etc.) 			- Costs for Disruption\Support of Workforce 			- Costs for Repair\Recovery\Restoration of Operations 		Private\Commercial Industrial Sector (s) (Productive Base) 			- Industrial Structure damages 			- Industrial Capital Asset\Equipment Damages 			- Losses to Industrial Revenue Generation 			- Costs for Disruption\Support of Workforce 			- Costs for Repair\Recovery\Restoration of Operations 		Public\Governmental Sector; Federal, State and Local Governments 			- Damages to Public Buildings and Facilities 			- Damages to Public Capital Equipment and Related Assets 			- Costs for Disruption and Restoration of Public Services 				- Administrative 				- Transportation 				- Social\Community 				- Health and Sanitation Services 		- Lost Regional\Localized Tax Revenues 			- Damages to and Restoration of Utilities 				- Electrical 				- Water Distribution and Sewage Treatment 				- Communications (Including Private\Commercial) - Damages and Required Repair to Transportation Infrastructure  (Roads\Highways and Rail; Other?) - Costs for disaster relief and aid to victims - Damages and\or Costs of Repair for Restoration of Civil - Engineering Storm Damage or Flood Control as in Place at the Time of Katrinas Impact 		Environmental and Natural Resource(s) - Costs of Environmental Surveys for Assessment of Damages - Costs for Recovery or Remediation Where Applicable - Costs of Debris Removal and Disposal\Containment - Short to Interim Evaluation of Environmental Resources with Commercial Impact (Fishing, Suitability of Farmlands, etc.) Consequence of Introduction or Spread of non-Native Organisms Caused by inundation     Summary of Critical Analytical End-Products Subject to Review Listed; in order of priority: 	For Conditions defined as: a.) -  breach and related physical compromise of the levee\floodwall system as it actually occurred due to effects of Hurricane Katrina. b.) -  absence of structural failure or compromise of flood control or storm damage features subject to allowing for prevailing storm conditions that exceed(ed) physical project specifications where and to what extent they may have occurred). 	The following:   - Quantification to the maximum extent practical the total and net regional economic impact of Hurricane Katrina (for regions or level of geographic coverage as previously described, localized up through national levels); Integral and subj ect to defined conditions will be review of the (compilation of) statistics describing local and regional economic activity and demographic or household disposition before the storm that is essential to evaluation of pre-storm versus post-storm conditions or storm impacts.  Also to be reviewed under IPET will be an estimation of business activity and population that will be considered to be at risk as of the beginning of the pending hurricane season (i.e., June 1st 2006).  Of particular note for review requirements will be the evaluation of economic studies or analyses prepared within a limited timeframe following the occurrence of Katrina.  Past experience with disaster impact and assessment has revealed while limited infor mation may be available within a matter of days, it often requires as long as twelve (12) to fifteen (15) months or more for much of the data of concern to be consistently reported, consolidated, reviewed and corrected (where appropriate).  The timeframes mandated by the Federal Government for IPET will not allow such schedules and therefore incorporated into the understanding and thought process for review shall be evaluation of impact measurements as they can be reasonably or acceptably measured given lim itations of time and availability of data resources.    The execution of IPET involves multiple governmental agencies and analysts employed via contractual services, both in the capacity of performance of technical work and technical review.  For the purposes of using the REMI system, a total of three (3) site licenses and installations (with associated technical support) will be required.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 14-3K47-06 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Solexa, Inc. Hayward, CA pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.   Inside delivery is required to FOB destination to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705-2350, within 18 months of award.  This solicitation is unrestricted.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services have been located that are capable of  satisfying  agency requirements.  BFGL and immediate collaborators located at USDA, Roman L. Hruska Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Clay Center NE and The Fort Keough Livestock & Range Research Laboratory in Mile City, MT have a requirement to purchase services to catalog the full repertoires of genes expressed in the Bovine Transcriptome and ultimately seed the creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas.  This multi-institute initiative is supported by the USDA CSREES NRI award to grant proposal 2005-05011, which states the following objective “Establish a high-quality bovine Gene Atlas that will have extensive utility for all studies in ruminant physiology, genetics and genomics including genome annotation.  The expression data that will create the initial foundation of the gene atlas will be generated using transcript profiles generated from the 100 tissues collected from the “genome sequence” cow and her offspring. The minimum requirements for this service include the capability and knowledge required to perform a custom gene expression service that maps the transcriptome content of cattle by a process that captures, simultaneously, all the cDNA “signatures” in a sample from a complex mixture of cDNA molecules derived from total RNA.  This process must deliver a count of all cDNA (from mRNA) in a sample, even those in low/rare abundance or genes that have yet to be discovered.  Base quality scores must be provided for all the sequences.  Precision and sensitivity of the methodology must be in the dynamic range of quantitative detection from less than one transcript per cell to 100,000 copies per cell.  At a minimum, 1,000,000 “signature” sequence tags must be generated from each of the 100 samples of total bovine RNA.  An overall total of 100 million signature sequences with a minimum length of 20 bp must be produced from all the different bovine RNA isolates.  Because of the rarity of some of the tissues samples, only 5 ug of total RNA will be supplied by the government for some samples. The service must include a partial bioinformatic analyses of the sequence information to help creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas (tag counts and identities).  All steps to produce these sequence tags must be assured by the quality control processes.  Samples must be tracked from project start to finish on a sample basis.  Data must be held in a secure database until accessed by secure FTP.  This includes virus protection, e-mail encryption, multiple firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure VPN technology, fingerprint scanners, and multiple tape storage systems to manage data security.  Sequencing of 100 million sequence tags must be concluded within 18 months.  All residual materials will be returned to our laboratories.
This requirement is exempt from the Service Contract Act. This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions and addendums: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; 52.217-5; In paragraph (b) of 52.212-5 the following apply: 52.203-6, 52.219-8, 52.219-14, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, 52.222-43, 52.225-1, 52.225-13, and 52.232-34; 52.232-18 Availability of Funds ;COMPLIANCE WITH VETERANS EMPLOYMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (JAN 1999) (DEVIATION)(USDA).

<SOLNBR>7TF-06-0004

<CONTACT>Elaine Lacker, Contracting Officer, Phone (817) 978-6142, Fax (817) 978-4739, Email elaine.lacker@gsa.gov
<DESC>This amendment number 4 is issued to post additional questions and answers.  Date and time for receipt of proposals remains on or before Friday, April 7, 2006, at 3 PM (CDT).  

Amendment 4 Questions and Answers:

1.  With respect to Amendment 03 for 7TF-06-0004, the GFE list
includes a CISCO 3824 Router.  Could you verify this model number; I've looked at the CISCO 3800 Series family data sheet and don't see a "3824" model -- only 3825 and 3845.  I wanted to see specifications for the router, such as power, weight, etc.  Thank you.  ANSWER:  Correct model # is a 3825.

2.  With the insertion of KG-250 into the system, presumably on our side of the demarcation point, we need to know whether all of the traffic, to/from the Hub, passes through KG-250.  ANSWER:  No, not all will be through the KG-250.

3.  In case all the traffic does not pass through the KG-250, we need to know which traffic is being handled by the KG-250 and which is by-passing KG-250.  ANSWER:  SIPR by KG-250, other traffic is NIPR and Voice.

4.  We would like to get clarification on the precise list of GFE for 7TF-06-0004.  In Amendment 01, the Answer to Question 10 states that Hub racks are GFE.  But in Amendment 03, the new wording for Section III GFE reads as follows:  Contractor will be required to engineer, incorporate, and configure Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) consisting of a Cisco 3824 Router and a Cisco 3560G switch into the required systems.  The government will not provide any other equipment.

This last sentence would imply that the racks are no longer GFE -- only the routers and multiport switches.  We would appreciate clarification on the precise list of GFE for 7TF-06-0004.

ANSWER:  Racks are not GFE.

5.  One clarifying question: As the revised GFE specifically states "The Government will not provide any other equipment", does this statement rescind the answer given in Amendment 1 stating that racks will be provided as GFE for the Hub?  ANSWER:  Yes, we rescind the answer given in Amendment 1.  Racks will not be provided as GFE.

6.  The 6 Mbps total uplink capability from the hub listed in answer (1) doesn't jive with the original SOW which stated:

"This system is to be equipped with one (1) network hub and two (2) portable/deployable earth stations providing simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 2MBps from each of the two deployed terminals and an available total (shared) downlink capability of 3MBps from the fixed central hub".

For those familiar with satellite operations, that "shared" caveat means that both stations share the 3MBps throughput.  What is described in the Q&A is a dedicated circuit, not shared.  Is this what they want?  It almost doubles the bandwidth needed to be compliant.

ANSWER:  Paragraph I. Overview, and Paragraph II. Deliverables, of the FedBizOpps Combine Solicitation notice posted March 16, 2006, is replaced in its entirety by the following paragraphs.  Also, please note the change in the performance period for the space segment lease.

I.  OVERVIEW:
 
This requirement is for the purchase of a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite communications system capable of Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) point-to-point operation.  This system is to be equipped with one (1) network hub and two (2) portable/deployable earth stations.  The 2 portable/deployable earth stations shall each provide simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 2MB (combined simultaneous uplink bandwidth of 4MB) and downlink channel available bandwidth of 3MB (combined simultaneous downlink bandwidth of 6MB).  The fixed network hub shall provide simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 6MB and downlink channel available bandwidth of 4MB.  Proposed system should be capable of providing secure, point-to-point broadband data connections and Voice Over IP (VOIP) capabilities (as described in deliverables) between any two points in the satellite footprint coverage area.  The required link for this system will be configured to provide bandwidth for full simultaneous operation of the terminals above.
 
II.  DELIVERABLES:
 
1. SYSTEM. The Contractor shall provide, integrate, test, deliver and install a satellite communications system with 24X7 technical support services provided for a 2 month period after acceptance of all equipment.  Contractor will provide dedicated, leased satellite capacity allowing 24 x 7 x 365 full access without contention for resources.  The space segment lease will be provided for a 2 month period after acceptance of all equipment.
 
The satellite communications system should enable secure, point-to-point broadband data connections between any two points in the satellite footprint.   This system is to be equipped
with one (1) network hub and two (2) portable/deployable earth stations.  The 2 portable/deployable earth stations shall each provide simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 2MB (combined simultaneous uplink bandwidth of 4MB) and downlink channel available bandwidth of 3MB (combined simultaneous downlink bandwidth of 6MG).  The fixed network hub shall provide simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 6MB and downlink channel available bandwidth of 4MB.  System shall provide up to 280 VoIP channels, 8 hardwired up to a maximum 38 STU/STE calls, and 48 hardwired data ports.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by potential offerors and to provide for an extension in the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The questions and answers are as follows:

1.	 Paragraph 3.1.3 (c) of the specifications indicates that data resolution shall be adjustable in the12 bit to 32 bit range.  What do you anticipate the mix of channels to be among 12 and 32 bit signals?  Specifically, do you anticipate a high number of 32 bit signals being monitored?  

      Clock resolution should be 32 bit.  Instrumentation signal imput should be in the 12 to 24 bit range.
2.  The specification does not specify the quantity of specific channel types that are required in each Node Room.  For example, Node Room 1 needs 100 channels.  For example, is that (30) +/- 5mVDC channels and (30) +/- 30 VDC and (40) 0-20mA channels?
70% of each node room capacity must be dissimilar metal thermocouple compatible (Type K).  The remaining 30% should be capable of handing copper/copper instrumentation wiring with output voltages in the +/- 5m VDC and +/- 30 VDC range.
3.	Paragraph 3.1.3 (e) of the specifications requires built in conversion   circuitry.  What part of this application requires 32-bit analog to digital conversion (ADC)? 
a.	Typical applications for industrial controls utilize 12-bit ADCs quite adequately.  This is roughly 3 5 digits of resolution in decimal representation.  Sensitive measurements often require 16-bit resolution, or 5 digits, to more accurately represent measured voltages.  Laboratory grade measurements sometimes need 24 bits of resolution to sample voltages with 7.5 digits of accuracy.  Is there really a need to sample voltages with 9.5 digits of resolution with a 32 bit ADC stage for this procurement? 
b.	Is this a misprint?
The synchronization clock requires 32-bit resolution. Signal inputs from instrumentation require A/D conversion resolution in the 12-bit to 24-bit range.  
       4.   Software - What is the requirement for Data Acquisition Software?  Please detail. Is custom data acquisition and software interfaces required?  If   custom software is not required, how will acceptance testing be   performed?  Can you please describe further the requirements under licensed software, ii, iii, iv?  What are remote module data acquisition software requirements?  What data acquisition capabilities on server and remote real time system?
           Data acquisition software should be of the same type and capability as found in Labview.  The Labview package is acceptable.  By licensed software, NRL means licensed copies of all software such that the software manufacturers will provide technical support if needed.

5.  For clarification, should each remote data acquisition module include a   
     UPS backup?  What is the housing / cabinet requirements for the remote modules and UPS if required?
 
      Sufficient UPS back-up capability, for each node room, for however many remote acquisition modules are proposed per node room is required to supply at least 30 minutes of emergency power.  If this can be achieved with one UPS unit per node room, that is acceptable.  Offerors may propose their own cabinet architecture, but should keep in mind that the UPS units may perform in node rooms that are non-airconditioned, humid,      and possibly dirty.

6.	Please clarify – do you really mean a 32-bit data acquisition resolution.    
      This far exceeds most commercial and Department of Defense  standards?  If not, please state what is required resolution.

See above answer.  The synchronization clock requires 32-bit resolution.  Signal inputs from instrumentation require A/D conversion resolution in the 12-bit to 24-bit range.  
7.  NRL’s Specification states that un-airconditioned spaces can reach temperatures in excess of100°C, how much in excess?

Temperatures in the un-airconditioned  node rooms can get up to 120 degrees F in the summer.  The equipment must perform accur

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to extend the closing date from April 6, 2006 to April 20, 2006.ately under those conditions.

8.  Installation to ship power – We plan to provide commercial A/C power connections that will be integrated into ship power by purchaser.  Is this correct?  If not, please clarify.

      Offerors are expected to provide standard commercial A/C power connections.  NRL will integrate the system into the ship’s power.
 

9.  Field wiring and transducers to data acquisition systems are to be installed by NRL, correct?  If not, please clarify.

      NRL will integrate all instrumentation and transducers into the system.

   10.   If the remote units operate on 24 VDC, what would be the power requirement?  1500 VA seems excessive for this type of application.  5-7  Amp-Hour is more of an industry norm for DC powered devices of this type.  If a cabinet is required for the remote UPS, this will be a more easily  integrated form factor.  Please comment and clarify.

     The remote data acquisition and control modules will operate on 110/120 VAC power on a maximum 15 amp circuit. The remote units operate on  A/C power. The output of our instrumentation is D/C voltage in the +/- 5mVDC to 30 VDC range. NRL requires sufficient UPS back-up to provide power to each node room for 30 minutes. Cabinet mounted UPS is fine.

  11.   We are very interested in pursuing this opportunity but need to request an extension of 2 weeks.  Is that a possibility?

          NRL will extend the due date for the receipt of proposals until 4:00 p.m. on April 20, 2006.

12.	Will NRL be able to issue a letter of delegation to allow the successful offeror to purchase items from the GSA Schedule.

No.  Such delegation is only permitted in special circumstances outlined in FAR Part 51.  In this instance, a commercial item type contract is anticipated, which does not permit the Government to issue such a letter.

13.	With respect to the operating system:  Windows 2003 Standard Edition will only address 4 GB of RAM. (8 GB is specified).  Is it OK to propose Windows 2003 Server Enterprise Edition which can address up to 32 GB of RAM?

Windows 2003 Server Enterprise Edition is acceptable.

14.	With respect to the CPU spec:  Is one dual core CPU sufficient or are two dual core CPU’s required?

One dual core is sufficient.

15.	With respect to the RAID functionality:  Does the RAID need to be built onto (On- Board) the system board or can it reside in one of the expansion slots?

It is not necessary that the raid be on-board.

16.	With respect to the Video spec:  Our suppliers have a PCI e Video card capable of 4 simultaneous outputs.  In order to meet the 5 simultaneous outputs spec we need to use an 8 port card which is a PCI card; not PCI e.  Is it ok to use the 8 port PCI card in place of a PCI e card?
     
We want the ability for digital output to all 5 monitors. If this can be achieved with one 8-slot PCI card then that is fine. If digital output to all 5 monitors requires two 4-slot PCIe cards then that is what we require.

17.	With respect to the riser card spec: our system probably won’t have a riser card.  Is that ok?

If the server case is tall enough then a riser card is not needed.

18.	With respect to the expansion slots:  what size of PCI-E slots are required (x1,x4,x8,x16,etc.)

X16.

19.	What are the intended use of the 4 PCI slots and 3 PCI e slots?  How many of these slots need to be occupied?

There is no specific need in the near term. We need to have the ability for future expansion.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and to extend the response date of this solicitation.  1.  The solicitation is hereby extended by one day.  Quotes must be received no later than 4pm, 11 April 2006.  Please be reminded that we will be accepting e-mailed and faxed quotes. 2.  Questions and Answers: Question 1:  Does the government have a preference between the following two approaches?  A system that includes a blackbody source that either meets stipulated accuracy criteria (0.1 degrees C), but only over the central 10 inches, or alternatively meets somewhat looser specifications (0.2 degrees C) over the full 12 inch area.  Answer:  The government would prefer the stipulated accuracy over the central 10 inches of the source.  Question 2:  Can the government provide clarification of the use of a "spectral radiance" specification on the collimated source?  This is a non-standard use of a unit customarily applied to diffuse sources in a context where the source is distinctly not diffuse.  Answer:  The Collimated Infrared Radiation Source can be thought of as being the equivalent of a diffuse source within the steradiency of the (almost) collimated beam, and having zero spectral radiance outside the steradiency of the beam.  Perhaps a familiar optical example will help explain the intent of the specification.  If a small, diffuse radiating source is placed at the focus of an off-axis parabolic mirror with 100 percent reflectivity, then the beam reflected off the mirror will be approximately collimated.  In this case, the Watts per meter squared per steradien per micron in the beam will be equal to the Watts per meter squared per steradien per micron emanating from the small diffuse radiating source.  3.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions from industry regarding clarifications of the requirements as follows:

1) Question -- The solicitation includes a requirement for “1.11 Maximum table weight load capacity 4000 lbs”.  Would anything less satisfy the Government’s requirement?

Answer --  The Government hereby restates requirement 1.11 as follows: “Maximum table weight load capacity shall be at least 2000 lbs but not more than 4000 lbs. (The maximum of 4000 lbs is dictated by the maximum load limit that NIST has the ability to get to the Vertical Machining Center)

2)  Question -- Does the Government prefer “Box Ways” or “Linear Way” construction?

Answer -- Either method is acceptable.

3)  Question -- What materials does the Government anticipate machining on this equipment?

Answer-- For informational purposes only, the Government will primarily machine Aluminum along with some steel and plastics.

4)  Question -- The solicitation includes requirements for “1.21 Rapid speed on all axis 500 inches per minute” and “1.22 Maximum cut rate of 650 inches per minute”.  Why is the rapid speed less than the max cut speed?

Answer:  The Government inadvertently reversed these requirements.  The Government hereby restates requirements 1.21 and 1.22 as follows:

1.21 Rapid speed on all axis 650 inches per minute
1.22 Maximum cut rate of 500 inches per minute

5)  All other terms of this solicitation remain unchanged.
