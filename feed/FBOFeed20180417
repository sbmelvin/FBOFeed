The protocol used by Emergent, and previously Sanofi and Acambis, is the only FDA approved potency testing statement of procedure for APSV. As a legacy vaccine, no longer sold or marketed, Emergent is the only known vendor to provide this potency testing. This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).
