<p><br />DRAFT<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />TITLE: Procurement of Multi-Protocol Analyzer for Internet of Things<br />LAB REQUESTING SERVICE: Public Safety Communications Research Division<br />I.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is currently supporting projects related to the Internet of Things (IoT) wireless technologies.  The IoT refers to the retrieval of data from machine and sensor sources.  These sources are always on and present a very small footprint.  To facilitate these new sources, the IoT utilizes many new communication protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., ZigBee, Thread).  The IoT also uses several existing standards such as Wi-Fi.  Because of the relatively recent emergence of the technology, new protocols are being introduced to the marketplace rapidly.<br />PSCR is looking for a multi-protocol analyzer which will allow examination of how various devices interact within these new protocols.  The equipment will be used to analyze channel usage and determine sources of interference or incompatibility when multiple sensors are used in a small area network.  Because PSCR research involves ensuring public safety communications are stable and effective, the protocol analyzer will be used to gain a picture of how the sensors interact, and determine issues related to coexistence and interference.<br />II.

Statement of Work & Salient Characteristics

Mobile Armored Shields

The MAS3818 mobile armored shield is engineered and designed to be attached to the exterior of a vehicle or carried by an individual on foot as a defense against ballistic threats. The MAS meets NIJ Standard 0108 Level III ballistic resistance standards. Weighing only 22 pounds, the MAS-3818 is designed for tactical mobility. This versatile product floats for use during water rescues. The integrated strap system allows the MAS to become an emergency stretcher. For added flexibility and protection, multiple panels can be quickly and easily joined together to form an expanded barrier.  Because they are lightweight, MAS3818 shields reduce muscle fatigue. This makes MAS3818 shields easier to control and enables VA Police Officers to remain protected and agile over longer periods of time.  The MAS includes a vehicle attachment system to withstand very high speeds and harsh driving conditions.  The integrated strap system on the shield allows the shield to be used as a stretcher.  Shields are equipped with molded rubber handholds and are provided with a sling strap that distributes the weight equally between the shoulder and arm.  A lightweight shield connection system provides capability for expanding threat protection by connecting shields.  MAS3818 shields have a patented design military ballistic grade material creating an outer jacket to encompass the shield.  

The shields are made from Dyneema, a super strong polyethylene fiber produced using a patented gel spinning process. This remarkable fiber is up to 15 times stronger than steel and is weight-for-weight 40% stronger than competing aramid fibers. Its unidirectional lightweight composite provides superior antiballistic protection for both personnel and vehicle protection. Functionality of the MAS is achieved by the insertion of the armor protective material, Dyneema, into a patented-designed military ballistic grade material creating an outer jacket to encompass the shield. The carrier can be designed to customer specifications. Special magnets allow the secure attachment of the MAS to a vehicle. The durable MAS is manufactured with materials that are resistant to temperature extremes and moisture.

MAS3818 shields are designed to stop multiple hits from the following ammunition and do not require periodic x-ray examination to ensure integrity of ballistic material.  By comparison, ceramic ballistic plates may fail after being hit by more than one round of ammunition and do require periodic x-ray inspection to ensure integrity.  MAS3818 shields are designed to stop multiple hits from the following ammunition:

7.62mm x 51 mm M80 NATO FMJ - 2780 fps
5.56mm LeMas Urban Warfare - 3718 fps
5.56mm M193 FMJ - 3200 fps
6.8mm 110gr OTM -2625 fps
30-06 M2 FMJ - 2736 fps
7.62 x 39mm M43 Steel Core FMJ - 2307 fps
12 Gauge High Velocity Slug

**Included is a M855/SS109 Mobile Armored Shield upgrade that provides increased protection to include M855 and SS109 ammunition.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Develop Center (ERDC) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Oceanweather, Inc., 350 Bedford Street, Suite 404, Stamford, CT 06901-1742, to provide wind fields (and where identified pressure and mean monthly ice concentration fields) for the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific and Western Alaska at pre-defined domains, grid and time resolutions for the period 01 January 2017 through 01 January 2018. The resulting wind, pressure and ice fields will be provided on external hard drives, documentation describing the file format and any evaluation performed on the final meteorological estimates to point-source, marine sites (buoy data). All wind/pressure specifications used in the Wave Information Study (WIS) have all been developed by Oceanweather, Inc. Therefore, Oceanweather, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of providing the wind/pressure inputs. Oceanweather, Inc. has over the past three decades supplied all wind/pressure inputs for the WIS effort and changing contractors would present a significant risk to the Government as the entire wind/pressure archives would have to be regenerated, and the entire WIS re-run. Long-term wave climatology needs to remain consistent and results from another contractor would therefore be of little to no use. The intent of this procurement is to award on a sole source basis under simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil no later than 12:00 pm CST on 17 August 2018. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. The NAICS code is 541690 and the business size standard is $15 million.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(c)

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to—

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Examples. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Listed End Product <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Line item No. Listed Countries of Origin <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________ ___________ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________ ___________ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________ ___________ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[List as necessary] <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Certification.

It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.

In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p><br />1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. <br />(a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. <br />(b) Requirements. <br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. <br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. <br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. <br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. <br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. <br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. <br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. <br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. <br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: <br />&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 <br />(d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. <br />(e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: <br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action. <br />(End of Solicitation and Contract language)<br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating do not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MT on August 20, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Marilyn Herrera. The E-mail address is Marilyn.Herrera@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Marilyn Herrera, (303) 497-3870, E-email address is Marilyn.Herrera@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

(Refer to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire for acceptability criteria and additional details).</p>
<p>8. Certification that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</p>
<p>Past Performance (Criteria 4): Offerors are required to provide customer reference name(s), company affiliation and current contact information (phone number and email address) for the horizontal construction contract in the Contiguous United States with a contract price of $150M or more within the last 5 years (completion date no earlier than July 2013) referenced in questionnaire item 3. For Federal projects submitted, the Offeror should submit finalized CCASS or CPARS reports, otherwise the customer reference(s) and contract information in response to the FBO questionnaire will be considered for the Offeror and its team members.</p>
<p>The Government may contact the Offeror's provided project reference to evaluate the overall level of satisfaction. References identified in 3e may be asked to comment on items such as quality of service, timeliness, adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance, management of the work, subcontract management, including timely payment to subcontractors or suppliers, ability to resolve problems quickly and effectively, safety, relations between the owner and contractor, level of support, and professional and accurate communication exchanges.</p>
<p>Past Performance information (e.g. CCASS or CPARS reports) submitted by offerors under Factor 4 will be considered and verified. The Selection Panel will be provided any relevant past performance information from Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture or teaming arrangement) identified in the offeror's responses, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the Offeror.</p>
<p>All complete submissions will be evaluated by a Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). All offerors rated as Acceptable by&nbsp;the SSEB for all eight factors&nbsp;will be placed on the Prequalified Sources List and will receive fair opportunity to compete for each action solicited from&nbsp;the established&nbsp;Prequalified Sources List. As noted, the purpose of the Prequalified Sources List is to facilitate solicitation of several specific standalone "C" type contracts. All such contracts solicited from the Prequalified Sources List are expected to be Design-Build (DB). Responses submitted to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire and associated narrative responses will be used to determine qualification for the Prequalified Sources List, but may also be used in Phase I of the two-step DB selection process for contracts solicited from the Prequalified Sources List.</p>
<p>Project-Specific Phase I Solicitation Procedures:</p>
<p>1. The Government will provide all firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, specific evaluation criteria for Phase I, general information about the evaluation criteria that will be used for the Phase II solicitation, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with responses to the evaluation criteria and a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project.</p>
<p>2. The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond to the Phase I notification of intent for each project. Any pre-qualified firm that fails to respond to the notification of intent within the allowed time with all required information will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>3. After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will evaluate each firm's competitive qualifications based on the responses to the Phase I notification of intent, which will represent Phase I of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p>4. Project-specific Phase II Request for Proposals (RFPs) will be sent to the five (5) most highly rated firms in the Phase I evaluation. The Government reserves the right to send project-specific Phase II RFPs to more or less than the five most highly rated firms in the Phase I evaluation.</p>
<p>5. Any prequalified firm that responded to the Phase I evaluation criteria and was not one of the firms provided with project-specific Phase II RFP may request a debriefing from the contracting officer.</p>
<p>Project Specific Phase 2 Solicitation Procedures:</p>
<p>1. The due date for receipt of proposals will generally be 30 days after issuance of an RFP. A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) composed of individuals with relevant technical expertise will evaluate all technical proposals received in response to the RFP. An attorney shall be a non-voting member. The Deputy for the Office of Small Business Programs (D, OSBP) may serve as an advisor to the SSEB and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Procurement Center Representative (PCR) may serve as an advisor to the SSEB for review and evaluation of the submitted small business participation plans and subcontracting plans. All voting members of the SSEB will independently review each technical proposal, prepare a technical analysis of each proposal, and assign an appropriate adjectival rating for each factor and performance risk. A price analysis will be completed and a cost analysis may be completed if determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>2. The Best Value Trade-off (BVTO) solicitations shall also state, at minimum, whether all evaluation factors other than price, when combined are (1) significantly more important that cost or price; (2) approximately equal to cost or price; (3) significantly less important that cost or price (10 USC 2305(A)(iii) and 41 USC 3306(c)(1)(c)).</p>
<p>3. A Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) shall be convened for all contracts over $100M and any other occasion that it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>4. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) will review the SSEB technical analysis and the SSACs comparative analysis (when applicable), but the award decision will represent the SSA's independent judgment of best value to the Government. The SSA's decision shall be based on a comparative assessment of all proposals against all evaluation criteria contained in the solicitation. The SSA's decision will be documented in a Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) and will include the rationale for any business judgments and trade-offs made or relied on by the SSA including benefits associated with any additional costs.</p>
<p>5. The selected proposal will be awarded using BVTO procedures. The RFP may state an intention to award based on initial offers received without discussions. However, the Government will reserve the right to enter discussions if it is determined to be in the Governments best interest.</p>
<p>Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Safe File Exchange: Phase II solicitations and Contractor proposals will be sent via AMRDEC safe file exchange.</p>

<DESC>*** Acknowledge this Amendment with Quote ***

The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions from interested contractors and update the RFQ with the latest applicable Wage Determination.
As a result of this Amendment, the Responses due time and date is NOT extended.
Q1.  The work description notes that electronic copies of the original blueprints are available online.  These are not on the FedConnect website.  Will they be posted to this site or is there another site you can direct me to so that I can download them for reference?
A1.  Available PDF blueprints are attached to this amendment.
Q2.  Based on the photos, it looks like the taller end wood posts are tied into other fence systems.  This is not noted in the project description.  Please clarify how we are to handle this.
A2.  The post on the West end of the fence is joined to two other fence system. This post will be replaced. The rails that secure to this post from the West and North (5 total) must be removed and re-attached, with as little removal of existing materiel from the rails as possible, and using the same type of joinery as currently exists. Temporary removal and re-installation of adjacent fence rails or sections is allowed, and temporary support of these rails should be included if necessary.  If it is not possible to re-assemble these joints as currently done the contractor may use alternative joints that are durable and don't change the external appearance of the fences, with COR approval for the revised joints. ---The post on the East end is lagged into the adjacent building, and will also be replaced. This post is secured to the building with two lag bolts. Any areas of the building that will be covered when the new post is installed should be scraped and painted before it is re-installed.
Q3.  It is stated that a high grade oil-base primer be used and then two coats of exterior finish paint.  What type of paint is the finish paint?  Do you have specific brands or series that you would like us to price as a basis-of-design?  As you know pricing per gallon varies greatly and so does quality.
A3.  Contractor will provide the wood primer and metal primer(rust-inhibiting), both of which will be high quality and compatible with latex finish paint. The finish paint will be California C2 Premium Exterior latex semi-gloss and will be supplied by NPS.
Q4.  Is the intent to award all 3 price line items?  I'm trying to understand the breakdown better.  Line Item 00010 is to remove the wood components (except for the gate posts) and perform masonry repairs, correct?  Line Item 00020 is to replicate and install all the fence components including gate hardware refinishing, correct?  And Line Item 00030 is for the priming and finish painting of all wood components, correct?  If you don't take Line Item 00030 you may want to have the wood components in Line Item 00020 shop-primed prior to installation.
A4.  NPS intends to award all line items.
Q5.  Who is responsible for removing and reinstalling fence mounted signs and numbers?
A5.  NPS w
