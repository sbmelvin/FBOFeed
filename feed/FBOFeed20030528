<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) announces the availability of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. DAAD19-03-R-0011 for Experimental and Theoretical Development of Quantum Computers dated May 2003.  ARO, together with the Advanced Research and Developme nt Activity (ARDA), solicits research proposals for the following four categories:  (1) 'Quantum Computing Concept Maturation' proposals are for large scale, four-year combined experimental and theoretical studies of potential physical embodiments of quant um bits and quantum logic, perhaps including studies in the related fields of quantum error correction, control, decoherence, and entanglement.  (2) 'Short-Term, Innovative Concept' proposals are for smaller, short term (1-3 year) experimental or theoretic al studies of novel concepts on any aspect of quantum information science related to quantum computing with the objective of addressing a specific question, developing a specific technique, performing a specific measurement, or exploring a new quantum comp uting concept that could engender a larger scale project in the future.  (3) 'Quantum Algorithm' proposals are for three-year studies to primarily develop new quantum computing algorithms but may also consider issues of quantum computational complexity, co mputability, and architectures.  (4) 'Quantum Computing Graduate Research Fellows' proposals are for three-year fellowships for graduate students who are U.S. citizens working on quantum computing for investigators funded through the ARO/ARDA quantum compu ting program.  Each proposal should indicate how the proposed work will conform to or extend beyond the quantum computing roadmap found at http://qist.lanl.gov.  Milestones in the proposed project should be clearly linked to the roadmap.  The BAA solicitat ion contains additional information along with instructions for white paper and proposal preparation and submission.  Informal white papers must be received at ARO by 4:00 P.M. local time on July 1, 2003.  White papers are not required prior to proposal su bmission but are strongly encouraged.  Proposals must be received at ARO by 4:00 PM local time on October 7, 2003.  Electronic submission of white papers (if submitted) and proposals is required.  This BAA may be found on the ARO website at http://www.aro. army.mil/research/index.htm.

<CONTACT>MARY A. RICHE, (410) 962-4880
<DESC>NA 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-engineer services are required to perform all services required to evaluate the feasibility of alternatives for the disposal of water treatment plant residuals (1) to meet the requirements of NPDES Permit No. DC 0000019, and as an alternative, (2) to achieve a minimum of 85 percent removal of incoming solids to the sedimentation basins with one or more continuous discharges to the Potomac River.  The Contractor shall prepare an integrated environmental impact statement to analyze the impacts to the natural and human environment for the proposed action.  Documentation shall be in accordance with the latest version of Engineering Regulation ER 200-2-2, Army Regulation AR 200-1, AR 200-2, and Council on Environmental Quality R egulations and other applicable Army policy and guidance. It is envisioned that this contract will also include future contract modifications for design, Support during Construction and start-up services. The estimated AE fee is in the range of ($5M-$10M).  Approximate project start is scheduled for November 2003 with a completion date of December 2009. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS: If the selected firm is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan with the final fee proposal will be required, consi stent with Section 806 (b) of PL 100-180, PL 95-507, and 99-661.  A minimum of 45% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns.  At least 20% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small di sadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and University or Minority Institutions; 10%  with women-owned small businesses (WOSB); 3% shall be placed with Hubzone Small Businesses (HubSB); 3% with Veteran-owned small business (VOSB ); and 3% with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small business (SDV). The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. The type of contract proposed is firm fixed price. 2. PROJECT INFORMATION (a) In general terms, the project features the Washin gton AqueductÃ¢Â€Â™s recently issued USEPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (No. DC 0000019) which includes requirements necessitating that a permanent method of residuals collection and treatment be implemented.  This contrac t will include studying the feasibility of several options to meet the requirements and completing the NEPA compliance process for the action. The Washington Aqueduct entered into a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement (FFCA) with the USEPA that establi shed strict deadlines for delivering documentation and achieving compliance with the issued NPDES permit.  A strict deadline has been identified for the completion and submittal of an alternatives evaluation to the USEPA.  To ensure compliance with this pa rticular deadline, and subsequent deadlines in the FFCA, this alternatives evaluation must be completed in a manner so as to satisfy the NEPA requirements for federal actions. The alternatives must be considered in terms of performance, cost, and minimizin g environmental consequences. The alternative selected must be one that can be implemented to meet the compliance deadlines established in the FFCA, including completion of construction. The Contractor should consider two additional elements that concern t he construction phases of the alternative:  (1) How could the commencement of operations be phased-in so that the solids of at least one of the sedimentation basins solids are recovered and not returned to the river by as early as March 1, 2008? (2) How wi ll the alternatives be constructed to accommodate the seasonal water production demand of the plants and the restriction on making any discharges to the Potomac from February 15 to June 15 during the period of time that the FFCA is in effect? In addition t o requirements of the NPDES permit and the FFCA, current and future SDWA requirements necessitate further optimization of the water treatment process.  The desi gn shall consider enhanced coagulation to assure water quality and pursue optimal and economic methods of collection, treatment and disposal of the water treatment plant residuals. The estimated construction value is in the range of ($50M-$100M) Completed documents shall include (detailed construction plans, specifications, design analysis, estimate of construction cost, and related administrative data. (b) The AE firm selected shall provide the final design products in the following CADD format: AutoCadd ( Current Release).  The design is not required to be performed using a specific CADD system. However, the A-E will be required to provide any digitizing and/or translation services necessary to deliver the final design products in the aforementioned CADD fo rmat. 3. SELECTION CRITE-RIA: The criteria which will be the basis for selecting firms are identified in Numbered Note 24. Additional special criteria include the following: (a) All responding AE firms must provide discussion of their ability to provide th e final design products in the indicated CADD format. (b) Specialized experience with the preparation of feasibility studies and the design of Water Treatment Processes. Contractors can improve their ranking by demonstrating experience dealing specifically  with the removal of residuals. Additionally design experience resulting in construction contracts, which are completed on schedule and on budget will be ranked higher. (c) Specialized experience with the preparation of environmental documentation and publ ic coordination for water treatment processes. Higher ranking will be given to contractors that have prepared similar environmental impact statements for other residual projects resulting in successful, on-schedule implementation of the project. (d) Profes sional qualifications necessary to prepare and professionally seal plans and specifications. 4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: See Note 24 for general submission requirements.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA)  The Government intends to award a contract for Airborne Broadcast Intelligence (ABI) and Combat Track II to Boeing Co., Chantilly, VA..  This contract includes all necessary labor, material, equipment and services to perform the following:  procure up to 25 Airborne Broadcast Intelligence (ABI) Integrated Hardware Systems and Combat Track II (CTII).  The proposed contract action is for integrated hardware systems for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 entitled "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(1).  This contract action represents a follow-on contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than the Boeing Company would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. Award of the contract and the placement of orders and/or exercise of option(s) for the ABI Systems is subject to Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) waiver as mandated by OSD/C3I. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 18 Jun 03. Award of this contract will be made on or about 15 Sep 03.  Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above.  The Government will consider proposals from all responsible sources.   See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Contact Person:  Carol Watkins (816) 823-4906.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling Improvements (IMO23990) at Federal Building 2, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, Solicitation Number GS06P02GZC0540.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents (prepared by an architect/ engineer) through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000.  The approximate contract length is 24 months after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 1, 2003.  This procurement will be completed using a one step source selection process, with full and open competition, limited to those firms having an existing design, construction, and/or design-build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region as of the date of the CBD announcement (May 28, 2003.)  The bi-state region, as defined by the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), consists of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray.

Building 2 of the Bannister Federal Complex is a fully occupied office building of approximately 250,000 gross square feet, which consists of a basement and two levels above ground.  The five air handling units in three roof top fan houses were added to the building around 1960.

The scope of work includes the following:  1)  Sealing all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units; 2) Phased replacement of supply and return fans and motors and the conversion of the existing constant volume system to a variable air volume system; 3) Replacement or repair of all existing supply ductwork on the roof; 4) Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building; 5) Provision of a new variable air volume, direct digital control system with a fixed supply air temperature; 6) Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof; and 7) Maximizing energy efficiency within the constraints of life cycle cost reasonableness. 

The request for proposals (RFP) solicitation is expected to be issued on or about June 27, 2003.  All requests for the RFP must be in writing.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must provide valid identification in the form of one of the following:  a business license; DUNS number, or valid state driver’s license.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held at 1500 East Bannister Road on or about July 8, 2003, to brief prospective offerors and to explain or clarify the project scope and submission requirements.  GSA will receive Requests for Proposal on or about July 29, 2003.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. 

The Government will use the “greatest value” concept in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  Offerors will submit technical qualifications and price at the same time, in separate packages.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  Technical factors, in descending order of importance are:  1)  Past performance of the firm; 2)  Qualifications of key personnel; 3) Management plan; and 4) Team composition, organization and prior experience as a Design-Build team.  Technical factors 1 and 2 will be given equal weight in the evaluation process.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. 

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 40 percent total for Small Business (SB), which includes 8 percent for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB); 5 percent for Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 3 percent for Hub Zone Small Business; (HZSB); 5 percent for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB); and 3 percent for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contract Specialist, to request the RFP and for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Lee Ann Kramer, at 816-823-2283.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Advanced Technology Center (ATC) intends to procure a GenePix 4100B Integrated Array Scanner with copies of GenePix Pro 4.1 acquisition as an upgrade to a trade-in of an GenePix 4000A Array Scanner with Axon Instruments 3280 Whipple Road, Union City, California 94587.  The supplies and services herein are being procured with the simplified acquisition procedures as defined in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 421450 and the business size standard  is 100 employees.   The focus of the laboratory tumor angiogenesis and endothelial cell gene expression profiling, is the interaction of a tumor and its vasculature, is critical for both tumor growth and the spread of tumor cells to distant organs.  The Surgical Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute is requesting GenePix 4000B Integrated Array Scanner with copies of GenePix Pro 4.1 acquisition.  NCI will be trading in an older  Integrated Array Scanner, an AXON 4000A scanner purchased in FY02.  The NCI shall be receiving a trade-in discount of $16,000 worth of hardware equipment with a transfer of the extended hardware warranty of $5,500.00.  The upgraded 4000B scanner scans at 2 wavelengths in a single pass (at 10 microns resolution with a full scan area of 22 x 71.5 mm), dramatically increasing acquisition speed to only 5 minutes.  The simultaneous scanning eliminates the need for post-capture image registration, avoids pixel shifting, and reduces photobleaching.
This scanner has a sensitivity of 0.1 fluor/um2,  detecting weaker signals, while maintaining a superior signal to noise ratio.  The sensitivity of this instrument is important for detecting subtle changes in gene expression profiling in tumor vasculature.  The sensitivity of the scanner for detecting changes in gene expression is instrumental in obtaining results that are accurate and reproducible.  This scanner provides greater depth of field (64 microns) which is ideal for thick specimens and non-planar slide irregularities, which occur regularly with microarray glass slides.  Again, this scanner corrects for irregularities which results in gene analysis data that is reproducible.  Axon Instruments is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the  GenePix 4000B Array Scanner, coupled with the GenePix Pro Array Software.  It sets the highest standards in the acquisition and analysis of data from all types of arrays with powerful acquisition speed.  Unlike other scanners and software that may take weeks to master, the GenePIX system can be used for routine scanning, acquisition and analysis straight out of the box.  Most importantly, it allows for high resolution scanning of a standard glass array under 5 min.  Since our lab routinely uses microarrays to study gene profiling of tumor vasculature, this scanner allows a greater number of arrays to scan without a compromise in resolution of data acquired.  The above features of the Axon GenePix 4100B Integrated Array Scanner are believed to be unique to the NCI.  This is not a notice for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 12, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<SOLNBR>RS-RES-03-063

<ARCHDATE>08122003
<CONTACT>Paulette Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 415-6594, Fax (301) 415-8157, Email pds2@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking innovative ideas in the areas of Nondestructive Evaluations (NDE) of concrete structures and instrumentation to monitor the performance of these structures for various properties.  NRC is interested in the types of available approaches and their range of applicability.  Research proposals are solicited in the following areas: (1) NDE testing to identify and detect very small (micrometers) cracks and other flaws in concrete; and (2) reliable monitoring techniques, e.g., embedded and surface mounted sensors or other instrumentation to monitor parameters essential to verify the performance of an entombed structure as predicted by performance assessment modeling.  Entombment is a method of decommissioning in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a structurally long-lived material such as concrete. The entombment structure may need to be appropriately monitored until the radioactivity decays to a level permitting decommissioning and ultimate unrestricted release of the property on which the entombed structure resides. One of the first steps in the entombment procedure is to assess the existing condition of the structure to be entombed.  A high concrete permeability could allow the transport of radionuclides through the structure to the environment. The greatest single factor affecting the permeability of such a structure is likely to be the existence of cracks within the concrete.  The size, distribution, and connectivity associated with such cracks determine the bulk permeability of the structure and thus the rate at which water can move through it to transport radionuclides from the contents of the structure to the environment.  Cracks, particularly micro-cracks which are not detectable by visual inspection, can form extensive networks that will allow significant movement of water through the entombed structure.  The NDE must both detect and characterize (spacing, width and depth) the cracks in order to be of value in formulating the necessary input to concrete degradation and flow codes that will be used in the performance assessment of the entombed structure.  Further, the NDE technique must be robust enough to be applicable to non-accessible parts of the structure, e.g., parts of the structure below ground or where only one side of the structure is accessible. Continued surveillance and monitoring may be necessary until the radionuclides decay sufficiently so that they no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Since the entombed structure may need to function for a period exceeding 100 years, monitoring techniques and strategies may be needed that will be able to confirm predicted performance. Research proposals are requested to address the issues listed above.  Specifically, individuals or organizations with specific expertise or capability with regard to NDE techniques for assessing networks of micro-fractures  or strategies and instrumentation for monitoring the performance of the structure, particularly for parameters such as formation and growth of surface-opening cracks, distribution of deleterious ionic species such as chlorides, depth of carbonation, and corrosion activity of embedded steel in the structure, will be considered. Proposals shall include a breakdown of estimated costs and describe the approach to the issues described above and what different alternatives, if any, will be considered.  In addition, a capability statement, and resumes showing the proposer's capability to perform the work in the areas listed above should be included. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.  Written proposals may be submitted by all concerns - small businesses, large businesses and universities, etc. and will be accepted until 3:30 pm local time on July 28, 2003.  Multiple contract awards are anticipated.  Offerors shall submit separate proposals for both areas of interest for which they wish to be considered.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The estimated budget range for a contract will be $415K to $425K for the NDE testing and $130K to $140K for the sensor study.  Offerors shall submit their written technical proposals (four copies) and written cost proposals (four copies) to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mailstop: T-7-I-2, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  Proposals shall contain a cover page including proposal title, technical and administrative points of contact with telephone and facsimile numbers and E-mail address and be followed by a letter signed by an authorized official specifying the proposal validity period (at least 90 days).  Offerors shall submit technical proposals with the following minimum information: (1) A resume for the principal investigator outlining his relevant education, experience, and publications; (2) a narrative setting forth the proposed statement of work and describing the proposed methodology for accomplishing the work, what criteria will be used to determine the success of the research, and what different alternatives were considered or are available; (3) a narrative describing the proposed organization's experience in performing the type of research described; (4) a description of the research facilities which the offeror is proposing to use including the offeror=s degree of access to these facilities.  Offerors shall submit a cost proposal with appropriate cost breakdown per FAR  Table15-2 for each technical proposal submitted. Proposals will be evaluated and selected for award based on the following factors in descending order of importance. Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria. (1) 50 points - Overall technical merits of the proposal and qualifications of the principal investigator with particular emphasis on his/her past research and practical experience in the area of research; (2) 50 points - The plan of execution and access to facilities and equipment to conduct the research; (3) (not to be scored) - availability of funds and (4) (not to be scored) - reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Dermatology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. Raghu Nath, Vienna VA 22182, to continue to apply the nuclease P1-enhanced 32P-postlabeling chromatography of Dr. Kurt Randerath for the detection of I-compounds in cultured cells from patients with various neurodegenerations.  The Dermatology Branch has as one of its  major interest human neurodegenerations caused by defective repair of DNA damage.  Its been published that nerve cells likely die because of the accumulation of unrepaired oxidative DNA damage in several diseases. The Dermatology Branch is now trying to establish the presence of one or more of these unrepaired lesions in certain diseases.  The lab has been and needs to continue to use Dr. Randerath's postlabeling assay to determine whether any oxidative lesion is repaired abnormally in diseased cells.  This is the only assay that can detect structurally unknown oxidative lesions which may cause neurodegeneration.  It can detect as few as 1-5 lesions per cell.  Dr. Nath undertook his post-doctoral fellowship under Dr. Randerath and now that Dr. Randerath is no longer performing experiments Dr. Nath is the only trained source that can faithfully care out the Randerath postlabeling.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology, plans to procure on a sole source basis with Aquatic Eco-Systems Inc., 1767 Benbow Court, Apopka, FL 32703 for a Fish Aquatic System to be used in the study of the vascular development in Zebrafish. This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334513 and the business size standard is 500 employees. By understanding genes that regulate angiogenesis, the Laboratory of Pathology envisions the discovery of novel targets for anti-angiogenic therapy from its zebrafish research thereby increasing the armamentarium of drugs to combat cancer.  In order to maintain and breed zebrafish to pursue experiments the Laboratory of Pathology requires a Fish Aquatic System from Aquatic Eco-Systems which is the only system known to: 1) provide a fail-safe robust biofilter (a submerged bead biofilter) that will not collapse and become anoxic in case of water disruption to the system;  2) provide blue lids and baffles in the fish holding tanks that reduces the light intensity by 50% inhibiting the growth of algae on tank walls;   3) use opaque blue tubing to deliver water from the distribution manifolds to the fish tanks which, prevents blockage of tubing with algae and bacterial growth;  4) provide multiple monitoring systems (one monitors parameters including temperature, pH, conductivity, sump level, pump pressure and water on the floor while the other connected to the reservoir system monitors temperature and a conductivity dosing system as well);  5) to have a self-cleaning rate with water flow at six turns per hour and contains baffles that enable water and solids to be picked up from the bottom of the tank which, minimizes tank maintenance;  6)  to have a free-flowing system with 10% water change on a daily basis allowing water changes on a continuous basis which, maintains constant flow rate to every tank in the system;  7) to prevent mixing of outside water with the fish system water and prevents fluctuations in water quality to affect the fish health.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 3,  2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Bruker Biospin Corporation, of Billerica, Massachusetts for one new 600 MHz 19F/ 1H Dual 5 mm probe, to be used as a drop in replacement for the existing AVANCE 600 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) instrument previously purchased from Bruker Biospin.
 
***Sole Source determination is based on the need for the new 600 MHz 19F/1H Dual probe to have complete compatibility with the existing AVANCE 600 MHz NMR magnet and console.  It must be a drop-in replacement that can be mounted on the magnet.  Additionally, the replacement probe must interface with the electronic and software controls, specifically, the radio-frequency electronics, Bruker Biospin GRASP gradient system, and the variable temperature controls of the AVANCE 600 NMR console.  Bruker Biospin Corporation is the only known vendor who can provide a replacement probe that will meet the drop-in replacement and interface requirements while maintaining absolute compatibility with the existing equipment.

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 6, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Background:  The costs of Federal regulations have been documented in two previous Office of Advocacy studies, Hopkins (1995), and Crain and Hopkins (2001).  Building on the knowledge base developed by the 1995 study, the 2001 research took a broader approach and further documented that small businesses do bear a disproportionate share of the burden imposed by Federal regulations.  The latter of these studies, for instance, found that the cost per employee for compliance with all regulations was $6,975 for firms with 20 or fewer employees but $4,463 for large firms with more than 500 employees.  In addition, small businesses spent twice as much complying with tax regulations as large businesses.  These two studies can both be found at http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/#regulation.

The Office of Advocacy would like to update this existing research.  Possible research avenues should follow, enhance, and expand the existing research in order to allow us to compare the results with the previous work.

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY COSTS OF DEVELOPING A FOREIGN MARKET FOR A SMALL BUSINESS

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Small business policy makers are continually proposing programs to assist small firms to export to foreign markets, citing the statistics showing few small firms selling to world market.  The success of export promotion programs have always been evaluated in the context of “so few small firms” exporting despite the great efforts of promotion.

Most small firms do not export because the costs of developing export markets far exceed the additional profits derived from export promotion. The cost of developing foreign markets has always been much higher, in terms of monetary costs, as it takes patience to turn a profit and to maintain these markets. This is further hampered by the higher costs of selling to foreign customers—higher costs of contract dispute litigation, currency value fluctuations, as well payment settlements, etc.  A better understanding of these costs of exporting would certainly assist policy making in developing programs to assist small firms in entering or not entering foreign markets.

The researcher will investigate the costs involved for small firms to expand into foreign markets.  For instance, there are costs involved in learning about the new market(s) for a firm’s products including knowing more about the foreign customers, the competition, and the costs of developing sales leads and negotiating sales.  In addition, the cost involved in fulfilling the sales contracts as well all other direct and indirect costs.  A careful review of literature is mandatory.  Market and non-market factors contributing to the high costs of exporting by small firms should be identified and the potential for reducing these costs investigated.

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY STATE PROCUREMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0014
<RESPDATE>062703
<ARCHDATE>07122003
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The Office of Advocacy has not explored the effect of small business procurement at the state and local level since a report in 1991.  That report (see Research Summary #108) stated that small firms accounted for 80 percent of the total state and local contracts with the private sector, and that most of these contracts were with companies within their jurisdiction.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) has proposed a rule that would implement section 211 of the E-Government Act of 2002.  Section 211 would open up the Federal Supply Schedule to the state, local, regional or tribal governments (including local educational agencies or institutions of higher education).  This new rule is limited in scope to Federal supply classification code group 70, which includes: “automated data processing equipment (including firmware), software, supplies, support equipment, and services.”  The primary motivation for this rule, according to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, is to “make ‘government’ (considering all levels) more efficient by reducing duplication of effort and utilizing volume purchasing techniques for the acquisition of IT products and services.”  Approximately 68 percent of GSA schedule 70 contractors are small businesses.  However, the top twenty schedule 70 vendors – all large businesses – reported $5.3 billion in schedule business in 2002; the three largest schedule 70 firms are: Dell Computer ($1.3 billion in schedule 70 sales), IBM Corporation ($505 million), and Northrup Grumman Information Technology ($406 million).   

The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a study on expanding the GSA schedules similar to this proposed rule in 1996.  It found an overwhelming number of state and local procurement managers would use the GSA schedules if it were available to them; however, existing state and local laws might preclude them from doing so (including competitive bidding restrictions, rules limiting purchases to in-state firms, and/or preferences for special groups).  Many of the current state and local contractors in this study, especially those that were small businesses, worried that opening up the competition for contracts to include GSA vendors would have a negative effect on their business.   This report, though, was less clear on the overall implications for small firms.

Questions that should be addressed in any research proposal should include, but are not limited to: What is the impact of this rule change on small business?  Does it expand opportunities for small businesses, or would it be a net loss for them (especially those accustomed to receiving state and local contracts)?  Would state and local small businesses need to add themselves to the GSA schedules to remain competitive, and is GSA capable of handling the influx of new schedule filers if that is the case?  Moreover, while this particular rule limits its scope to information technology products and services, what are the implications if it is expanded to include more schedules?  

Previous studies have utilized case analysis; however, this research is not limited to that methodology.  State procurement managers, associations, or public records might provide ample data.  It might be advisable to limit the scope to specific states or localities (rather than exploring all fifty state and numerous regional and local governments).

<DESC>Industries tend to have life cycles which are often based on technology.  This research would compare new, growing, and declining industries from the perspective of business turnover and competition with special attention to technology and price shocks as they relate to small business.  The researchers would most likely need to determine industry ages (or stages), technology levels by industry (possible using changing shares of skilled workers) and product price changes by industry.  A potential model would be to determine the factors that affect the industry firm turnover rate, in addition to other potential models.  

Industry firm size data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau that could assist with this research (www.sba.gov/advo/stats/data.html, www.census.gov/csd/susb/susb.htm).  The dynamic Census data is a potential data source as it contains information on establishment births and closures by firm size in addition to establishment growth and decline information for continuing establishments from 1989 to present with about a two year lag.  Another possibility would be using information from Dun & Bradstreet that tracks firms through time.  Proposals using the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns would most likely not be able to complete this research as it is not a longitudinal database and does not have firm size information.  Regardless of the data used, proposals need to present a convincing case for the ability to secure access to data that will complete the project within 12 months.

<DESC>The Federal Reserve Board has conducted three major surveys on small business finances, the most recent survey being the SSBF-1998 for financing information in 1998.  (See www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/surveys/.)  The survey contained a wealth of  information on small business finance related issues—the uses of various types of financing from such suppliers as banks, finance companies, leasing companies, friends and family, and owners, as well as a firm’s experience in obtaining the most recent loan.  The Office of Advocacy is interested in research topics on small business financing utilizing this database. 

The researchers will develop topics on small business finances using the survey(s) to investigate the availability of financing to special sub-groups of small firms—namely, small minority and/or small women-owned firms. The research should attempt to answer the question regarding the efficient operation of the market(s) such as-- “whether there existed a financing gap in the credit market(s) for a sub-group of firms in market environment where a multitude of alternative financing sources are available.”

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer questions from potential offerors.

Question 1.  The furnace should be equipped with MKS Mass Flow Controllers, can you inform me on which type of MKS Mass Flow Controller is preferred?
Answer.  Type 1179 or equivalent are preferred.  Metal seals are to be used.
Question 2.  Is the solicitation for new or refurbished equipment? Can either be quoted?  Answer.  Either can be quoted. However a new equipment warranty is required.    Question 3.  If a new furnace is required, would the use of certain refurbished sub-components such as LPCVD pump and/or mass flow controllers be allowed in order to reduce the price?  Answer.  Yes, as long as each piece is identified as used and the system carries a complete new equipment warranty.  Question 4.  Regarding facilities preparation 2.0, can you provide more details regarding the "designated location"? For example, will all the necessary facilities including power, water and gas be plumbed to the furnace with the understanding that the furnace supplier will make the final connections? Please specify if other.  Answer.  The NRL will be responsible for providing the necessary facilities at the designated location for furnace. The contractor must make the final connections.  Question 5.  It appears the specification is written exclusively for a MRL furnace. Does this preclude a furnace that meets all specified performance criteria, but deviates from the over-specified design details listed in the RFQ? Are "Or Equivalent" items acceptable?  Answer.  Equivalent items are acceptable.   Question 6.  Paragraph 4.6 of the spec calls for 8 gas loops. The Nitride and Poly processes require 5 loops. Are the other 3 loops to be spares? If so is there a desired configuration for these 3 loops?  Answer. 4.6 The gas module must be capable of controlling at least 8 mass flow controllers.  4.8 Note: A loop is a valve, plumbing & mass flow controller (MFC) assembly for one gas.  There is no desired configuration since there are no spare loops only the gas module capacity for more mfc's.  Question 7.  Paragraph 8.1, Auto loading System, sub line #4 "Must fit in existing furnace footprint, and add no more than 6" to overall height". What are the maximum height, width and length dimensions for the entire furnace?  Answer.  Maximum dimensions are 8 ft high x 4ft deep by 8ft long.   Question 8.  Is a small footprint 4 stack furnace populated with 2 tubes per the spec (capable of accepting 2 additional tube in the future) desired? Or are 2 individual single tubes, tabletop or other, desired?  Answer. Either configuration is acceptable as long as the required specifications are met.  The Response Date is changed to June 4, 2003.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoD's new 'system of systems' environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter-or a similar forcing function construct-to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of 'key performance parameters' throughout the acquisition process. NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes, incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process. The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers. This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes. It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education. It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents. Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness. In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following: 1) Researching emerging training technology 2) Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services 3) Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 4) Datamining 5) Section 505 Compliance 6) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness 7) Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition 8) Systems Engineering 9) Human Systems Integration 10) Human Systems Engineering 11) IMI/ADL SCORM production process 12) Human Performance Analysis 13) Training Requirements Front End Analysis 14) Cost-benefit Analysis Personnel qualifications - the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above.

<DESC>REF A: Strategic Plan for Transforming DOD Training, March 1, 2002, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Director, Readiness and Training Policy and Programs
REF B: MIL-PRF-29612B Performance Specification, Training Data Products
REF C: DI-SESS-81517B through DI-SESS-81527B Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)
REF D: MIL-HDBK-29612-1A through 5A Guidance for the acquisition and fielding of training systems
I. BACKGROUND: Training Transformation, mandated by OSD in REF A, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DODs new ?system of systems? environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.        
II. PROBLEM: The Performance Specification (REF B) and associate DIDs (REF C) do not address Human Systems Integration (HSI) and are inadequate in their treatment of human capability and performance. The guidance for acquiring and developing/providing training products/services in REF D is similarly deficient. Moreover, REFs B, C and D need to be updated to reflect best business practices, latest technology and standard industry terminology related to fielding effective human performance-oriented training. III. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for revision of REFs B, C, and D, (and additional volumes if required) and training support in their use. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected Contractor. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.  IV. RESEARCH REQUIRED: Prior to product development, market research must be conducted of best business practices concerning relevant research and emerging processes related to Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT); incorporation of HSI factors across those processes; insertion of technology; and acquisition of effective human performance-oriented training. Of special interest is embedded training; interactive multimedia instruction; advanced distributed learning; distributed mission training; media analysis and analysis of alternative training systems (including cost-benefit); human performance measures; and verification and validation of computer-based courseware. Analysis must be conducted to evaluate the potential for application of the identified best practices within REFs B, C, and D. V. CAPABILITIES REQUIRED: Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with REFs B, C, and D. The ability to synthesize identified best business practices into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrocesses into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  Additionally, successful performance will require understanding of and experience with the 4) 1) Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, 2) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness, 3) Weapons and training systems acquisition, 4) Systems Engineering, 5) Human Systems Integration, 6) Human Systems Engineering, 7) IMI/ADL SCORM production process, 8) Human Performance Analysis, 9) Training requirements front end analysis, and 10) Cost-benefit analysis. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS:  - the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above. SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoDs new system of systems environment.  As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes.  Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process.  Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing.  Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.  

NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above.

The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes,  incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process.  The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers.  This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes.  It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education.  It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. 

The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents.  Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness.  In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following:

1)	Researching emerging training technology
2)	Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services
3)	Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 
4)	Datamining
5)	Section 505 Compliance
6)	Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness
7)	Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition
8)	Systems Engineering
9)	Human Systems Integration
10)	Human Systems Engineering
11)	IMI/ADL SCORM production procive at consensus on best practices. Accordingly, participation with the DTSWG in that deliberative process and development/revision of the documents will be weighted factors for source selection.  In addition to the research requirement, the required capabilities include 1) Human Systems Integration; 2) Human Systems Engineering; 3) Training requirements front end analysis; 4) Human Performance analysis; 5) Americans with Disabilities Act compliance 6) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness; 7) Media Analysis of latest technology; 8) Cost-benefit analysis; 9) electronic performance support systems; 10) IMI/ADL SCORM production process; 11) Weapons and training systems acquisition; 12) Systems Engineering. VI. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The Government will require the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above. VII. SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.

<DESC>DISREGARD PREVIOUS REVISION AS THE SUMMARY REVERTED TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS -----              

REF A: Strategic Plan for Transforming DOD Training, March 1, 2002, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Director, Readiness and Training Policy and Programs
REF B: MIL-PRF-29612B Performance Specification, Training Data Products
REF C: DI-SESS-81517B through DI-SESS-81527B Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)
REF D: MIL-HDBK-29612-1A through 5A Guidance for the acquisition and fielding of training systems
I. BACKGROUND: Training Transformation, mandated by OSD in REF A, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DODs new ?system of systems? environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.        
II. PROBLEM: The Performance Specification (REF B) and associate DIDs (REF C) do not address Human Systems Integration (HSI) and are inadequate in their treatment of human capability and performance. The guidance for acquiring and developing/providing training products/services in REF D is similarly deficient. Moreover, REFs B, C and D need to be updated to reflect best business practices, latest technology and standard industry terminology related to fielding effective human performance-oriented training. III. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for revision of REFs B, C, and D, (and additional volumes if required) and training support in their use. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected Contractor. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.  IV. RESEARCH REQUIRED: Prior to product development, market research must be conducted of best business practices concerning relevant research and emerging processes related to Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT); incorporation of HSI factors across those processes; insertion of technology; and acquisition of effective human performance-oriented training. Of special interest is embedded training; interactive multimedia instruction; advanced distributed learning; distributed mission training; media analysis and analysis of alternative training systems (including cost-benefit); human performance measures; and verification and validation of computer-based courseware. Analysis must be conducted to evaluate the potential for application of the identified best practices within REFs B, C, and D. V. CAPABILITIES REQUIRED: Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with REFs B, C, and D. The ability to synthesize identified best business practices into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  The joint services ISD/SAT and training acocesses into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  Additionally, successful performance will require understanding of and experience with the 4) 1) Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, 2) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness, 3) Weapons and training systems acquisition, 4) Systems Engineering, 5) Human Systems Integration, 6) Human Systems Engineering, 7) IMI/ADL SCORM production process, 8) Human Performance Analysis, 9) Training requirements front end analysis, and 10) Cost-benefit analysis. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS:  - the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above. SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

Fixed price per Regular Inamte Days:  80%

Home Confinement Inmate days:  19%

Furloughed Inmate Days: 1%

Insert the following paragraph in place of the above-referenced paragraph in Section B:

Services are required primarily for full-time resident days; however, all eligible residents shall be placed on home  confinement.  Home confinement is considered an essential part of the community program experience as it helps instill in inmate responsibilities necessary for the successful transition from institution to community living.  Through coninual monitoring, the Bureau of Prisons will ensure inmates are placed on home confinement as appropriate, taking corrective actions when so indicated.  It is expected that inmates shall be placed on home confinement upon meeting programming requirements and their eligibility date, with the consent of the Community Corrections Manager.

Per dime rates for inmates palced on home confinement shall be one-half the full contract per diem rate.  In the event the per diem rate does not divide evenly, the Bureau shall round-up the per diem rate, (i.e. a per diem rate of $67.53 divided by 2 = $33.765.  By rounding up, the home confinement per diem rate would be $33.77).

The following language shall be included in Chapter 10, paragraph 3(c):

Contractors are not required to provide meals, medical treatment, clothing or incidentals laundry service or other subistence items to residents on home confinement.

Contractors shall maintain deocumentaiton of all staff contracts with residents on home confinement.

The contractor is not required to reserve a bed at the center for a resident on home confinement.  The per diem rate for residents on home confinement shall be one-half the regular per diem rate.

The contractor shall collect subsistence from a resident on home confinement at a rate of 25% of their gross income.  The weekly subsistence collected shall not exceed the per diem rate established for home confinement times seven.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.  The main lies approximately 30 miles north of Salt Lake City adjacent to Interstate 15.  Hill AFB includes the main base (6,700 acres), Little Mountain Test Annex (740 acres, 100 miles distant) including Bovine Mountain (145 miles distant), Grassy Mountain (92 miles distant), Confusion Peak near Trout Creek (215 miles distant) and Boulder WY (245 miles distant).  These locations include 1546 buildings (14,265,621 SF) set on 961,784 acres.  Much of the utility systems on Hill AFB and UTTR are located in an explosive hazard area. 

Electrical System:  Power is supplied by Utah Power and Light over two 46.1 kV overhead transmission lines.  Other electric providers to remote areas include: Wells Rural Electric, Bridger Valley Electric, Raft River Electric, and Mt. Wheeler Electric.  The main base distribution system includes approximately 200 miles of 12.0 kV circuits, two-thirds of which are overhead and one-third underground.  The overhead portion are mostly bare copper conductors suspended on wooden poles.  The underground portion consists of cable in duct banks, although there is some direct burial cable.  Pole- or pad-mounted transformers are used to step the voltage down to the required utilization level.  Four substations are controlled by a “Supervisory Controlled Automated Data Acquisition” (SCADA) computer system.  Typical utilization voltages are 277/480-volt three-phase, 120/208-volt three-phase and 120/240 volt single-phase.  The electrical system includes street and traffic lighting along with airfield lighting and security lighting.

Natural Gas System: The Questar Gas Company delivers gas to the base at several delivery and metering points around the perimeter of the base, with the primary supplier being IGI Resources of Idaho.  Gas is delivered at a pressure of 350 pounds, while distribution on-base is primarily underground at a pressure of 35 pounds.  There are approximately 44 miles of underground piping in sizes ranging from ¾ to 8 inches, 70 gas meters, and 1500 regulators (200 of which have been recently replaced).  Approximately 80% of the underground system is polyethylene installed in the past ten years.  The remaining 20% is 14-year-old steel pipe serving several housing areas.  Natural gas is also provided to Little Mountain and UTTR North, each with one delivery point that is regulated and metered.

Potable Water System:  Water is produced on-base by six permitted wells; an additional three wells must be repaired.  Water treatment is by chlorination, fluoridation and phosphate added at each well.  The Weber Basin Conservancy District supplies supplementary potable water.  There are approximately 187 miles of distribution piping in the main system, including cast iron, ductile iron, asbestos-cement and polyvinyl chloride pipes ranging in size from 1.5 to 24 inches in diameter, as well as approximately 13,000 valves.  The potable water system includes approximately 1200 backflow preventers, an automated lawn irrigation system and three swimming pools.  Storage is provided by one elevated metal tank, two ground level metal tanks, and three below-ground concrete tanks, with tank sizes varying from .8 to 3.5 million gallons.  The main system was originally constructed in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s and 1960s.  In addition to the major system on-base, two minor systems serve Little Mountain and UTTR North.

Sanitary Wastewater System: The wastewater utility consists of one major system on-base and two minor systems at Little Mountain and UTTR North; these systems were originally constructed in the 1940s and expanded in the 1950s and 1960s.  Wastewater from the main base is discharged to the North Davis County sanitary sewer system through four flow meters.  The main system includes 19 pump stations, 14 septic tank systems and 4 holding tanks; the main system also includes approximately 200 miles of vitrified clay, polyvinyl chloride and cast iron piping ranging in size from 4 to 15 inches in diameter. The sanitary wastewater system also includes an industrial wastewater treatment plant (IWTP) and the associated collection system; separate from the domestic system. The IWTP and the industrial systems were renovated extensively from 1994 - 1998.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT AUG 04, 2003.

<DESC>DESC:  1. This is a modification to Solicitation Number SOL03000017, posted in FedBizOpps on 1 May 2003.  The proposal closing date and time is extended to Friday, June 6, 2003 at 4:00PM EST. 

2.  Due to the heightened level of security at the FCC 12th Street location, all proposals must be delivered to the FCC Warehouse, 9300 Hampton Drive, Capital Heights, MD  20743, Attn:  JoAnn Summers by 400PM EST, 6 June 2003.

3.  Proposals are to be submitted in the following format:  One (1) original technical and cost proposal and three copies of the technical proposal without cost. 

4. The following questions were submitted by a vendor in response to Solicitation Number SOL03000017.

Q – Please provide the ‘R’ value of the existing insulated siding on the building exterior.  If this is not obtainable, please provide the desired ‘R” value for the new construction.

A - The insulated exterior wall panels on the existing building were replaced in the early '80s, and we have been unable to locate any records of that contract.  We have no idea of the actual R value of the panels.  We know only that they are 2"-thick steel-skinned panels filled with insulating foam.  We specified in the SOW that the new enclosure be insulated in accordance with the prevailing local commercial code for this type of structure.  Vendors engaged in commercial construction should contact the appropriate office in Howard County to determine the code-required insulation value.

Q -  Are there specifications for the original construction of the existing building? If so, please provide.

A - We have one complete set of the original construction drawings of the existing building... no specifications document.  

Q -  Is there a ‘geo-technical report’ available at the site? Is there any available information concerning the water table?  Is the site in a ‘flood plain’?

A - There exists no "geo-technical report" for the site.  We know that the site is not in a flood plain, but we have no specific information on the water table (although we do know that there have been no water table problems in the 29 years since the existing building was built).  The grade level existing building is also 6' to 8' above the grade at the septic drain field.  This would indicate that the water table is not a concern.  The drawings for the existing building contain the notation:  "Soil Boring Data indicate safe soil bearing to be 3000 P.S.F."  If a vendor feels that additional soils testing is necessary, then that should be a part of the proposal.

Q - Please indicate what date the owner will have ‘Miss Utility’ inspect and mark the site.

A - Miss Utility has been contacted  and all utilities will be marked by 5/29.  Vendors were apprised of approximate locations of buried lines during the site visit.

Q - The time specified in the bid documents only allows 90 days. This is not sufficient to hire an architect/structural engineer, prepare construction drawings showing electrical, mechanical, concrete, structural building, soils testing, fabrication, installation, etc. of just the ‘general construction’. Time should be allowed for a genuine and properly constructed RF shield and anechoic treatment. This is not the type of project that should be hastily constructed. A period of 120 days as a minimum to a more paced schedule would allow 150 days. This is not excessive for all that is required to build this type of facility.   

A - The solicitation specifies a completion schedule of 16 weeks (112 days) after date of contract, not 90 days.  This was based on estimates of 12 to 14 weeks construction time.{END OF CHANGES}

<DESC>DESC: 1. This is a modification to Solicitation Number SOL03000017, posted in FedBizOpps on 1 May 2003.  The proposal closing date and time is extended to Friday, June 6, 2003 at 4:00PM EST. 

2.  Due to the heightened level of security at the FCC 12th Street location, all proposals must be delivered to the FCC Warehouse, 9300 Hampton Drive, Capital Heights, MD  20743, Attn:  JoAnn Summers by 400PM EST, 6 June 2003.

3.  Proposals are to be submitted in the following format:  One (1) original technical and cost proposal and three copies of the technical proposal without cost. 

4. The following questions were submitted by a vendor in response to Solicitation Number SOL03000017.

Q – Please provide the ‘R’ value of the existing insulated siding on the building exterior.  If this is not obtainable, please provide the desired ‘R” value for the new construction.

A - The insulated exterior wall panels on the existing building were replaced in the early '80s, and we have been unable to locate any records of that contract.  We have no idea of the actual R value of the panels.  We know only that they are 2"-thick steel-skinned panels filled with insulating foam.  We specified in the SOW that the new enclosure be insulated in accordance with the prevailing local commercial code for this type of structure.  Vendors engaged in commercial construction should contact the appropriate office in Howard County to determine the code-required insulation value.

Q -  Are there specifications for the original construction of the existing building? If so, please provide.

A - We have one complete set of the original construction drawings of the existing building... no specifications document.  

Q -  Is there a ‘geo-technical report’ available at the site? Is there any available information concerning the water table?  Is the site in a ‘flood plain’?

A - There exists no "geo-technical report" for the site.  We know that the site is not in a flood plain, but we have no specific information on the water table (although we do know that there have been no water table problems in the 29 years since the existing building was built).  The grade level existing building is also 6' to 8' above the grade at the septic drain field.  This would indicate that the water table is not a concern.  The drawings for the existing building contain the notation:  "Soil Boring Data indicate safe soil bearing to be 3000 P.S.F."  If a vendor feels that additional soils testing is necessary, then that should be a part of the proposal. 




Q - Please indicate what date the owner will have ‘Miss Utility’ inspect and mark the site.

A - Miss Utility has been contacted  and all utilities will be marked by 5/29.  Vendors were apprised of approximate locations of buried lines during the site visit.

Q - The time specified in the bid documents only allows 90 days. This is not sufficient to hire an architect/structural engineer, prepare construction drawings showing electrical, mechanical, concrete, structural building, soils testing, fabrication, installation, etc. of just the ‘general construction’. Time should be allowed for a genuine and properly constructed RF shield and anechoic treatment. This is not the type of project that should be hastily constructed. A period of 120 days as a minimum to a more paced schedule would allow 150 days. This is not excessive for all that is required to build this type of facility.   

A - The solicitation specifies a completion schedule of 16 weeks (112 days) after date of contract, not 90 days.  This was based on estimates of 12 to 14 weeks construction time.{END OF CHANGES}

The ASET IV system consists of a suite of six High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) which have been modified to simulate a composite air defense battery consisting of Radio Frequency (RF) Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM), Infra Red (IR) SAMs and Anti Aircraft Artillery (AAA).  Each suite consists of one Command and Control Communications (C3) Vehicle, one RFSAM simulator vehicle, two IRSAM sim ulator vehicles and two AAA simulator vehicles.  The AAA vehicle which was originally fielded has been modified into a dual-mode vehicle capable of simulating either of two different AAA threats.  The modified vehicle has been renamed the AAA(2) simulator vehicle.  A total of eight ASET IV systems are currently in the Army inventory.  There are systems at:  National Training Center, Fort Irwin, CA (3), Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk LA (1), Combat Maneuver Training Center, Hohenfels, Germany (1) , and Fort Hood, TX (1).  The other two systems will be fielded to Fort Campbell, KY (1) and Fort Bragg, NC (1) in FY2004.  The ASET IV is used to create a high-fidelity electronic warfare training environment in which helicopter aircrews can train in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE).  These P3I efforts are a continuation of on-going efforts which include: 	a.  Complete fielding (to include training of operators and maintenance personnel) of two suites of ASET IV vehicles (one each to Fort Campbell, KY and Fort Bragg, NC). 	b.  Design and complete corrective actions required to permit fielding of previously built RFSAM(2) modification kits. 	c.  Field (to include training of operators and maintenance personnel) the RFSAM(2) modification kits once the corrective actions identified in b. above have been completed. 	d.

DESC:  Sources Sought Synopsis.  Contracting Point of Contact:  Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Contract Specialist, (505) 846-6876, Technical Point of Contact:   Dr. John Gonglewski, (505) 846-4405. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Contracting Directorate on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking interested parties to submit a Statement of Capability pertaining to follow-on work on AFRL’s “Applications of Lidar for Vehicles with Analysis (ALVA)” Program.  The follow-on work will have a period of performance of five (5) years and a contract ceiling of $49 million.  The anticipated contract type will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee instrument.  BACKGROUND:  The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Advanced Optics and Imaging Division is seeking to acquire design, fabrication, test, evaluation, deployment of Lidars, laser radars, laser metrology, and complementary passive sensor systems in airborne, space-borne, or special test facilities.   Included is support to USAF assets and test sites for prototyping and understanding the role of non-weapons class lasers, laser radars, laser sensing, remote sensing and measurement systems, and general imaging systems.  Such assets include the Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS); USAF’S Argus or Cobra Ball or similar aircraft; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB); and other DoD service facilities such as White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) AND THE pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  Also included are the appropriate program planning and mission analysis for such systems.  The goal of this effort is to establish a technology base for and initial field demonstrations of advanced sensor systems suitable for airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) and space-borne missions and upgrade to MSSS imaging capabilities.  Special interest will be shown to new ideas and technologies in laser components; to airborne platform approaches and capabilities to terrain imaging, target identification, remote sensing, and designation; to laser waveform approaches which show a capability to perform multiple tasks e.g., tracking and imaging by switching rapidly between waveforms, and receiver approaches which perform real-time processing of wide band (>500MHz) signals with a significant composition of COTS elements; to system volume and weight minimization; to transportability; to laser facilities use and logistics; to computer simulations, modeling and analysis of relevant USAF and DoD laser and laser radar missions.  Work is expected to be conducted at various appropriate facilities including Kirtland AFB, the contractor’s plant, and Wright-Patterson AFB.  At least 20% of this effort involves support of the MSSS, Barking Sands, and other USAF facilities in Hawaii.  In partial fulfillment of this requirement, the qualifying contractor will be required to obtain office and support facilities on both Maui and Kauai and have demonstrated successful operations in these unique environments.  Work will provide technical analysis and engineering support for R&D activities in technology areas such as:  (1)  Compact device development, analysis, field demonstrations, and prototype deployment of CO2 and solid state lasers for airborne, spacecraft, and platforms for ground-to-space imaging applications; (2)  Systems development and new concepts in laser radars for ranging, imaging, mapping, chemical detection, reconnaissance, surveillance, target designation, communications and ancillary military applications.  This includes mission and technology analysis, laboratory experimentation and demonstration, and prototyping systems.  Emphasis will be given to laser radar systems which provide multiple, real-time capabilities and can be shown to perform more than one function per mission, e.g., chemical detection and imaging.  Imaging shall include the ability to perform coherent imaging and produce the equivalent of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) type images with sub-meter and sub-meter/sec resolutions and the associated ability to perform simultaneous range and velocity measurements for precision tracking; (3) Airborne, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and space-borne lidar systems development, prototyping, and deployment for the missions described in technology area (2) above; (4) Ground-to-space imaging and high altitude, airborne simulating, field evaluations of system concepts, subsystem components and integrated breadboard systems at the Air Force HI-CLASS, MSSS, MHPCC, and RME facilities on Maui and the Barking Sands facility on Kauai; and (5) Establishing a HI-CLASS real-time, high resolution tracking and imaging capability on the large aperture AEOS telescope in a monostatic configuration to serve as a state-of-the-art special R&D test facility.  The NAICS code is 541710, size standard is 500 employees and this is an unrestricted acquisition.  This is a follow-on requirement involving several Army and one Air Force contract, of which the current incumbent is Textron Systems Corporation.  A significant amount of this requirement involves the modification, maintenance and/or operation of highly specialized equipment at the referenced sites, such as the HI-CLASS laser radar and Field Lidar Demonstration (FLD) breadboard oscillator, which are research prototypes.  The Government has not maintained the design drawings; therefore, the current technology background required for the continued development of this equipment resides with the current contractor.  All interested parties are requested to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) outlining their capability to perform this work by 3:00 MDT, 23 June 2003.  Based upon responses to this announcement, the Government may elect to set aside this acquisition for small businesses, qualifying 8(a) businesses, or historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions.  CAPABILITY CRITERIA:  Interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to manage a broad-based support effort in the technology areas stated above and have, or be capable of obtaining a SECRET Facility Clearance.  The following criteria will be used in evaluating all responses to the synopsis:  (1) Experience in and with the five technology areas described above in the past five years; (2) Availability of an adequate number of qualified personnel to support the effort, and; (3) Facilities:  security clearances and storage facilities to support the work at the secret level.  Prospective offerors should also include information regarding their ability to support the noted facilities and their previous relevant experience which is specific to the remote sites referenced.  Include any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information.  The statements of capability will be limited to 15 pages in addition to resumes and pertinent samples of documentation (i.e. design, characterization, field testing and lab facility reports), the latter not to exceed 10 pages.  An original statement of capability and two (2) copies should be sent to Ms. Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Contract Specialist.  Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected.  Submit responses to Marialyn Achille-Argaez, AFRL/PKDB, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773 (or if hand-delivered to Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Bldg. 499 at the corner of Lowry and Carlisle, Room 127, Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5773.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoD?s new ?system of systems? environment.  As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes.  Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process.  Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter?or a similar forcing function construct?to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing.  Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of ?key performance parameters? throughout the acquisition process.  

NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT **THIS IS NOT AN OFFER OR SOLICITATION**
The Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) is interested in locating potential sources capable of providing an all-weather Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) antenna tuning unit.  DGPS beacons operate in the Medium Frequency (MF) band, from 283 kHz to 325 kHz and broadcast a Minimum Shift Key (MKS) (100 bps or 200 pbs) signal at 1000 watts.  Each beacon is assigned an integer frequency (in kHz) and uses one radiator to broadcast the signal.  The signal is series fed via tower heights from 90-ft towers to 300 ft towers and various sloping-T towers.  Current design uses a large, high-Q variable inductor to cancel antenna reactance and an impedance transformer to match antenna resistance to approximately 50 Ohms.  The current system performs well under constant conditions, but changes in weather have been linked to changes in ground system resistance and ultimately antenna resistance – a system design flaw requiring correction.  A High Frequency (HF) style tuning design places the existing inductor in parallel with the antenna and a capacitor in series with the transmitter and antenna.  The design has been proven with one variable capacitor and one variable inductor, requiring a network analyzer and hand tuning for optimum performance.  Current system needs automatic tuning motors as well as automatic tuning circuit, capable of detecting and correcting antenna mismatch to ensure Vertical Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) does not exceed 1.7:1 and remains below 1.2:1 for normal operation.  Antenna tuning unit shall be designed to withstand heavy weather and associated perils of outside, unmanned exposure to extreme climates and conditions.  Sources capable of providing equipment that meets the above specs must provide sufficiently detailed documentation/descriptive literature that clearly represents that these specs will be met.  This information is to be e-mailed to chouck@c2cen.uscg.mil or faxed to (757) 686-4018 on or before 30 June 2003.  Please ensure that information submitted includes company name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT **THIS IS NOT AN OFFER OR SOLICITATION**
The Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) is interested in locating potential sources capable of providing, a temporary deployable Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (N/DGPS) radiator and site.  The current N/DGPS plan is to build 126 navigational beacons capable of calculating and correcting GPS errors.  The system uses the Medium Frequency (MF) band of 283 kHz to 325 kHz, broadcasting a Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal of either 100 bits per second (bps) or 200 bps.  Current goal of 99.7% availability prohibits most tower work.  System could maintain availability and conduct tower improvements with a transportable tower system.  The transportable tower should be easy to deploy, requiring no special commercial driver’s license endorsements and shall be capable of deploying via C-130 with minimum effort.  Tower electrical characteristics shall be similar to existing tower characteristics (ranging from 90 feet to 300 feet) and may require additional guy-style top-loading elements (TLE) for optimum electrical performance.  Transportable tower shall be capable of housing all tower accessories, including up to 12 TLE, guy anchors, at least 36 symmetric counterpoise ground radials no shorter than 150 feet long, grounding mat no less than 20 feet by 20 feet, grounding stakes, and all electrical and mechanical connectors required to achieve optimum system functionality.  Transportable tower assembly shall have accommodations for antenna tuning unit.  The second phase of the project is to develop a portable N/DGPS site for rapid deployment following natural disasters and terrorist activities.  The system would have the same features listed above with the radiator, antenna tuning unit, transmitter, reference stations (including two 30 foot masts), integrity monitors, modems, power supply and all other components necessary to achieve system functionality independently from any existing site infrastructure.  A second unit may be desirable based on space and weight constraints.  Units shall be rugged and capable of withstanding extreme climates and natural disasters, allowing USCG to provide emergency DGPS coverage within hours of national emergency.  Sources capable of providing equipment that meets the above specs must provide sufficiently detailed documentation/descriptive literature that clearly represents that these specs will be met.  This information is to be e-mailed to chouck@c2cen.uscg.mil or faxed to (757) 686-4018 on or before 30 June 2003.

<DESC>The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is actively seeking a licensee and/or CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) partner to collaborate on the development and commercialization of NOAA Science On a Sphere™ (SOS).  SOS presents global Earth science to the public in a new and exciting way by providing an engaging three-dimensional representation of our planet as if the viewer were looking at the Earth from outer space.  The system uses a bank of computers coupled with strategically placed video projectors to display animated geophysical and atmospheric information onto the outside of a large, opaque sphere.  The integrated display can be viewed by moving around the suspended sphere while listening to an audio narrative describing the images and the processes being observed on the sphere.  An example of one simulation is a darkened room in a museum setting; the audience walks in to see the Earth seemingly floating in space and slowly rotating through day/night and night/day scenes.  Additional simulations that can be displayed on SOS include, any kind of global satellite imagery, images of the Sun, moon and other planets, weather forecasts, near real time and past weather events, ocean currents, population growth over the centuries, and many, many more.  Displayable simulations on SOS are limited only by the imagination.  The concept for SOS originated entirely within NOAA and is intended to provide a dramatic visualization of complex Earth and planetary science information in an understandable form for the public.  Possible public venues for SOS displays include museums, government facilities, nature discovery centers, secondary schools, universities, scientific conferences, corporate headquarters, airports and other major transportation centers.  SOS can be used as a tool to help scientists better visualize and understand dynamic processes in the oceans and atmosphere.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intracranial Hematoma Detector
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A LICENSEE TO FUND RESEARCH AND COMMERCIALIZE A INTRACRANIAL HEMATOMA DETECTOR


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build a non-invasive intracranial hematoma detector, which will detect blood pooling and, potentially, clots in the brain.

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking industrial partners willing engage in cooperative research (CRADA) and license a patented technology for the diagnosis of intracranial hematomas (U.S. patent 6,233,479 B1).  The final goal of this process is the commercialization of this technology by the CRADA partner who would produce and sell intracranial hematoma detectors.

The patented technology uses MIR (Micropower Impulse Radar).  MIR uses short, high frequency electromagnetic pulses to obtain information in a non-invasive manner.  Unlike ultrasound, MIR can operate well through the skull, which is of great importance for intracranial hematomas.  MIR technology offers the following advantages:  low power (battery operation), safe, portable, non-invasive, fast, and lightweight.  This technology is particularly suited to designing portable devices.  It would be useful in many settings including in urgent care, emergency care, hospital bedside care, or home health care setting.

Portable intracranial hematoma detectors using this technology would offer medical personnel a tool to use immediately at the scene of an injury, in the ER, in urgent care facilities, or in the home healthcare settings.  Such detectors could help triage accident victims by facilitating the rapid determination of the extent of cranial injuries.  Also, the screening by the detector could reduce the need for CT scans, which would minimize unnecessary exposure to x-ray radiation. .  In addition, such detectors could also provide a convenient means to monitor the growth of a hematoma. 

The use of this device could reduce health care costs and improve patient outcomes.  It could greatly reduce the medical costs associated with testing and treating cranial injuries, as well as potentially reducing the costs of patient rehabilitation and convalescence by reducing the morbidity resulting from current treatment time delays.

Researchers at LLNL have performed some limited clinical testing of this technology that indicates the technology does work.  LLNL would like to find a CRADA partner who is willing to help fund further development of this technology as well as commercialize the technology upon completion of the research.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Intracranial Hematoma Detector should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000020-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Intracranial Hematoma Detector.

Delivery schedule and operating characteristics of the TPS shall be addressed in the contractor's proposal. ADAS system and all related upgrades must be compatible with the currently installed T700 Engine Test Cell and also adaptable to all future upgrades including future LTS-101 engine variants. The requirement for interchangeability of spare parts for both test cells is for cost reduction through reduced spare parts inventory. This would also keep both test cells operational and with no loss due to down time. The T700 Engine Test cell has a CMR-ADAS that is an operator prompted and controlled computer based data acquisition system that monitors, conditions, processes, calculates, records and displays in graphic/animated formats various channels of engine/dynamometer generated electrical signals that represent specific engine/dynamometer operating parameters.  The CMR-ADAS performs the same functions on electrical signals generated by thermocouples and a barometric pressure transducer that when processed by the CMR-ADAS, equate to the ambient conditions (temperature and barometric pressure) in the engine run room.  The resulting ambient condition values are also used by the CMR-ADAS to calculate certain engine performance factors such as the Shaft Horse Power output of the engine under test.  Major components of the T700 Engine Test Cell are a CMR modified Dell Model XPS T800RMHZ computer, 104 + Keyboard, two View Sonic GS773 17” monitors, shelf mounted printer, power supply, Brick Modules (001, 002, & 003), thermocouples, signal conditioners, pressure transducer, accelerometer vibration transmitter, mechanical vibration transmitter, system software packages. The CMR-ADAS SYSTEM is custom designed to monitor, record, and display all engine and load parameters, warn the operator of impending out-of-tolerance conditions and prompt the operator through all test procedures.  The system performs all engine calculations, relative to standard day conditions, in real time and presents engine pass/fail evaluations to the operator, with printer support for automatic data logging and record keeping. All major components of the ADAS must comply with Section 508 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and are required to be installed in the available empty spaces of the existing LTS101-750B-2 Test Systems without affecting functionality and without significantly affecting placement of current instrumentation and hardware.  All ADAS components shall be placed in standard 19” NEMA racks where possible. The signal conditioning unit must be able to meet or exceed all the required input parameters and corresponding accuracy requirements described in LTS101-750B-2 and LTS101-850B-2 Engine Test Requirements.  This includes any future growth requirements listed in the attachment.  The unit must have front panel access to all circuit cards for ease of maintenance.  ADAS processor unit shall contain standard industrial Pentium class CPU or equivalent and memory modules. The system processor shall digitally record all data required by the engine LTS101-750B-2 Original Engineering Manufacture Testing Instruction (OEM-TI) 8124 and LTS101-850B-2 OEM-TI 8360.
