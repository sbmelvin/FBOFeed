<SOLNBR>140G0219Q0008
<RESPDATE>110818
<ARCHDATE>01012019
<CONTACT>Valdez, Robert
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard 1000 employees for an upcoming requirement 193 nm nanosecond laser ablation system. 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 

Project Description: The United States Geological Survey, Geology, Geophysics, Geochemistry Science Center (GGGSC) requires a 193 nm Excimer Laser Ablation (LA) system for use with a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The instrument will be used for laser ablation MC-ICP-MS isotopic analyses of a wide variety of applications as part of the mandated research programs of GGGSC and other parts of the USGS and related activities. This instrument will focus on the development and application of novel in-situ isotope tracer studies as well as build on LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology research currently ongoing in the Plasma Laboratory in Building 95. The new laser system will expand USGS in-situ analytical capabilities for current research projects of high priority to the Mineral Resources Program, including studies related to Alaska and/or processes related to the formation of ‘critical mineral’ deposits, and create additional opportunities for collaboration and reimbursable activities.

The laser ablation system must be available with the two volume S155 sample cell that ensures signal stability and uniformity throughout the LA sample cell. The laser ablation system must provide analytical precision for all locations within the cell, improving throughput, but also delivering the necessary performance for high precision in-situ isotopic analyses required by the critical minerals research. 

1.	The LA system must be a Class1 laser product.

2.	The LA system must include a 193 nm wavelength excimer laser, a beam delivery system for ablation of solid samples within a sealed sample chamber for introduction into an ICP-MS.

3.	The excimer laser must be air-cooled.

4.	The excimer laser must output at least 12 mJ of 193 nm from the laser head for spot sizes up to 100 microns diameter or square and deliver a laser energy density to the sample (fluence) of at least 20 J/cm2. 

5.	The LA software and laser hardware must be able to track, calibrate and store fluence and laser voltage metrics including gas exchange information directly within the LA software.

6.	The LA system must be able to operate at a laser repetition rate of at least 50 Hz.

7.	The system must be equipped with a laser attenuator that can reduce the laser energy delivered to the sample to sufficiently low enough energy for biological and easy melted materials such as sulfides or metals. The attenuator should also provide maximum energy transmission for high energy applications. The attenuator should be software controlled. Details about the attenuator must be provided. 

8.	The LA system must be able to communicate with a Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS instrumentation to at least initiate automated analyses of up to 100 samples in a single session.

9.	The LA system must include an ICP-MS plasma torch extinguish detection system to prevent loss of argon, helium and critical samples in the event of ICP-MS failure during an automated analytical session.

10.	The LA system must have laser spot sizes available in a size range from 2 microns to (at least) 300 microns diameter or square. 

11.	The LA system must be a self-contained platform with all the necessary laser gas cylinders, vacuum pump and halogen filter contained in a sealed gas cabinet. The LA system should include castors for within laboratory movement as well as the ability to stabilize the instrument off the floor.

12.	The LA system must include 2 mass flow controllers that are integrated within the user software. One mass flow controller for control of the Helium flow (up to 1000 mL/min) and one mass flow controller for control of Nitrogen flow (up to 20 mL/min). The gas control must be able to be programmed from within the LA system software. 

13.	The LA system must provide a high quality real-time image of the sample in transmitted (plane and polarized light) and reflected illumination. Geological materials must be able to be imaged at sufficient resolution to see features as small as the smallest spot size. 

14.	The LA system must be able to image large areas of the sample chamber through an easy to use mosaic function. Information about the wide field or sample mosaic function must be provided.

15.	The LA system must be equipped with an XY stage with at least 150 mm x 100 mm of usable travel. Information about the stage must be provided by the vendor.

16.	The LA system must be equipped with a constant-volume, two-volume sample chamber for rapid washout and elimination of mass fractionation effects due to varying gas flow. The small-volume funnel must be fixed (or immovable) within the sample chamber and be easily removed for cleaning. Information about the sample chamber must be provided by the vendor.

17.	Sample holder(s) are provided by the vendor and should be able to accommodate samples of various sizes not limited to, but including: 10 x 25 mm round samples up to 25 mm thick; combination of 25 mm round samples AND  geologic thin sections (~26 x 46 mm); and flat-topped geologic materials up to 30 mm in height.

18.	The LA system must ensure signal homogeneity (within 1SE of single analysis), independent of mass, across the sample chamber. Information about constant signal across the sample chamber must be provided by the vendor.

19.	The LA system must be able to allow for easy drawing of lines and complicated ablation patterns. These patterns should be easily edited on the software computer. The software must be intuitive, flexible for a variety of applications and easy to use. The vendor must provide detailed information and on-site training about the operating software. 

20.	The LA system software must be able to import, rescale and reposition images taken from other imagine platforms such as photo scanner, light microscope, SEM or electron microprobe.

21.	The LA system software must be available for off-line programming of analyses.

22.	The vendor shall provide quotation and information regarding possible upgrades or optional equipment available including sample chambers, systems upgrades and optional accessories. 

A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. 

Responses to this announcement are requested from (1) SBA certified Small Business HubZone firms; (2) Small Business firms certified by a Small Business Administration (SBA) district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; (3) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small Business firms; (4) Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 334516 if 1000 employees. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.

Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website and no paper copies will be provided.
