The purpose of this project modification  is to relocate the cross-over line between the new supply line and resevoir line to outside the chlorination building and replace the associated (previously-unknown) non-functioning valves to allow project completion and enable  the water storage tank to be taken out of service (when maintenance is required) while maintaining water service to the base water distribution system.  Additionally, the modification is to construct a protective enclosure for the newly elevated tank valve pit to protect system components from environmental factors (i.e. freezing, rain, etc..), and also reduce maintenance and operation costs by not having to handle stormwater within shelter (i.e. no need for sump pump) and providing longer life to system components.

<DESC>Expression of Interest Sought

The United States Government, US Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Henrietta, Texas, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2,933 square feet of contiguous, first class, high quality office space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,218 contiguous ANSI/BOMA (usable) office area square feet (OASF) and 35 on-site surface parking spaces.  The lease term requirement is for five (5) years with one five-year renewal option.  To be considered, the office location must be within the boundaries of: Spring Street to the North; California Street to the East; Bois D’Arc Street to the South; and Crockett Street to the West; in Henrietta, Texas.  Preference will be given to first floor space.  Occupancy is required by March 1, 2010.  All expressions of interests must be received by December 4, 2009.  

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<CONTACT>Michael V. Brown, 717-861-6872

<a href="mailto:mike.v.brown@us.army.mil">USPFO for Pennsylvania</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.  POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS MR. MICHAEL V. BROWN.  SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO:  mike.v.brown@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 Million.  This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236.  This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firms for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Contracting Officers outside of the United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania may issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects.  Selection of Firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209  Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms.  Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package.  The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES:  The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Pennsylvania intends to award one or more (multiple awards may be made) Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard / Pennsylvania Army National Guard).  Each A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.  A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of each contract with no limit on individual delivery order amounts.  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contracts.  Contracting Officers outside of the USPFO for Pennsylvania will be able to issue Delivery Orders for A-E Services to support National Guard and other State and Federal Agencies throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  This announcement may result in the award of four (4) contracts to provide services to four (4) primary locations:  (LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP; LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP; LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS; and LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis.  Interested Firms must indicate the Location(s) for which they are submitting.  Since proximity of a Firms office for its project team and its knowledge of the locality as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished is an evaluation factor, interested Firms submitting for more than one Location are encouraged to make multiple submissions with the Firms office location and key project team tailored to each Location.  The A-E IDIQ contracts that are anticipated to be awarded will each be for an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods.  Individual Delivery Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include Delivery Orders under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Delivery Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Delivery Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g).  Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION:  The Governments selection of the best value contractor(s) is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL  meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services)  evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  The key positions should include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence  evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years)  evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules.  FACTOR 4  Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time)  evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods.  FACTOR 5  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to one of the following:  (a) LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP, (b) LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP, (c) LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS, or (d) LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; and knowledge of the identified locality)  evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months)  in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  FACTOR 7  Small Business Participation  evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal.  Relative to FACTOR 5  Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR>  <BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each LOCATION for which the submitting Firm wants to be considered AND clearly identify the LOCATION.

<RESPDATE>111909
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Division of Basic Sciences (DBS), Laboratory of Pathology (LP) plans to procure on a sole source basis a Maintenance Agreement for Government owned Pathway 855 (s/n 1001-87892-7321) with BD Biosciences; 2350 Qume Drive; San Jose, CA 35131-1807.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $7M.  

The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.

Currently, the ATC Building houses the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System (s/n 1001-87892-7321) and needs maintenance. The instrument is in use daily by laboratory personnel to perform scientific research towards the mission of the NCI. This instrument is used heavily and is considered an essential part in daily studies. For these reasons, it is imperative that a maintenance agreement be enacted in order to keep the machine running proficiently and for immediate access to all service bulletins that occur as time passes.

The purpose of this requirement is associated specifically with the need for a maintenance contract for the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System. Since BD is the manufacturer of the instrument, the maintenance is necessary from the same vendor to ensure optimal use and guarantee that efficiently trained technicians perform any service that may be needed.

It is critical to the research community currently using the instrument that all service be performed by the same vendor that manufactured and implemented the equipment in the lab. It is imperative that the system is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could run distort information or disrupt studies currently in process on the instrument. Technicians to be provided from the vendor are factory trained, have access to technical manuals relating specifically to the system including recall notices. In addition, proprietary software and replacement parts are available only through BD Biosciences to supply and service their instruments. Specifically, the Pathway 855 system is equipped with a series of lasers which must be aligned, calibrated and replaced properly to ensure the results are accurate for the studies being performed on the equipment. 

Finally, BD Biosciences is the only company that stocks or has access to the specific parts needed to maintain the function of the system and offer proprietary software upgrades as well. For these reasons, no other source is known to the NCI capable of providing the service on the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System currently in use in the lab.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on November 19, 2009.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-100011-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) for the F/A-18C/D Roadmap Procurement Program (RPP) with L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3), Arlington, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $250M with a base five year ordering period with three additional one year options if the ceiling has not been exhausted. The F/A-18C/D RPP IDIQ will provide for the acquisition, modification and upgrades of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and for the modification and upgrade of F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) hardware and software components that are common with F/A-18C/D TOFT components to maximize capabilities amongst platforms.  L-3 developed and built the existing twenty-six F/A-18C/D TOFT training systems and provided upgrades and modifications for Software Configuration Set (SCS) 19C and 20X, Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) interoperability, Brief/Debrief Stations, Mission Operation Centers, image generators and visual databases.  The F/A-18C/D training systems’ requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, (to include, but not limited to 21X, 23X, 25X, 27X) and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the F/A-18C/D aircraft development roadmap that support training in the full mission spectrum from planning through mission rehearsal including individual through joint interoperability levels encompassing events in the initial strike fighter training syllabus, Strike Aircraft Training and Readiness (T&R)  Matrix, Air Combat Training Continuum (ACTC), and events associated with Inter-Deployment Readiness Cycle (IDRC).  Any new F/A-18C/D training systems, modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded F/A-18C/D systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor.  The FA-18C/D RPP IDIQ will also focus on reducing cost of ownership by optimizing existing hardware and software commonality across all F/A-18 and EA-18G TOFTs through the extensive use of common interfaces, data structures, hardware and software constructs.  As a subcontractor, L-3 provided hardware and software components for the thirteen F/A-18E/F TOFTs and the three EA-18G TOFTs that are common with the F/A-18C/D TOFTs.  These components include, but are not limited to the Instructor Operator Station, Brief/Debrief Station, visual database, image generators, host computers and interoperability of these devices with each other.  Common TOFT component modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development due to restricted rights and limited data rights. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.  A competitive acquisition would allow for a new system to be introduced to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award under the Training System Contract (TSC) II multiple award IDIQ at NAWCTSD.  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current TOFT design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing TOFTs.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G TOFTs, only L-3 possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and to maximize the capabilities amongst the F/A-18 platforms to include F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G TOFT common component acquisitions, modifications and upgrades within the Government’s requisite delivery schedule.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Government’s intent to contract on a sole source basis with L-3.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain F/A-18 C/D technical data,  and any other information, that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Holly DeFord (holly.deford@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 1 June 2009. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, the IDIQ Contract for the F/A-18C/D RPP will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee IDIQ task order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68936-09-G-0001 Task Order 0001, under other than full and open competition.  Negotiations will be conducted with AAI Corporation, P.O. Box 126, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0126, in order to procure engineering technical services,  consisting of engineering analysis, software development, software integration/testing, development/delivery of laboratory equipment , and technical documentation support of the Organizational level (O-Level) Electronic Warfare Test Program Set (OEWTPS) planning, development, and sustaining efforts.  This task will require laboratory and field testing for validation of the AN/USM-670 Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester (JSECST) test program set software to provide the U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Army (USA) and Foreign Military Sales [FMS] customers an Organizational-Level capability to test their onboard electronic warfare [EW] systems and related transmission lines- otherwise known as the EW Suite.  The requirements also include Foreign Military Sales. The primary role of the EW suite is to enhance the survivability and mission effectiveness of tactical aircraft through situational awareness and countermeasures.  Each year brings new challenges to the EW suite in the form of new and/or modified threat weapon systems.  The EW Support Equipment Team is tasked with developing the EW Suite Diagnostics Systems.   This mission-oriented software requires updates on a regular basis as a result of the highly dynamic tactical and strategic environments.  Currently, the U.S. Navy is fielding, jointly with the U.S. Air Force, a new generation of EW diagnostics equipment centered on the AN/USM-670 JSECST.As the designer and developer of the AN/USM-670 JSECST, AAI Corporation possesses the unique technical and engineering expertise, as well as the technical data package for the JSECST, including data not delivered to the Government.  This notice is not a request for proposals; however, any firm, other than AAI Corporation should respond in accordance with Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR RICHARD HARDING POFF FEDERAL BUILDING MODERNIZATION IN ROANOKE, VA, SOLICITATION NO.: GS-03P-09-CD-C-0061.  This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project.  The Allegheny Service Center in the Mid-Atlantic Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  The project delivery method being used is the Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc).  A Construction Manager as-constructor provides design phase services and construction phase work. GSA intends to award a contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building Modernization in Roanoke, VA, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Design Phase Services are expected to commence upon award of the contract, on or about October 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to commence on or about June 2010.

The Richard H. Poff Federal Office and Courthouse Building in Roanoke, VA is a fourteen story modern structure containing 187,649 usable square feet, 255,700 rentable square feet and 316,369 gross square feet with 75 indoor and 94 surface parking spaces situated on 1.3 acres.  This 14 story building was constructed in 1975 with green tinted glass curtain walls on the north and south elevations and brown brick on the east and west elevations.

The building’s tenant finishes have been modernized by the customer agencies but the aging electrical system, windows, HVAC, fire alarm and precast concrete panels require replacement.  The proposed capital project will correct structural and systems deficiencies in the 34-year old building. A list of sustainable objectives for the Poff project has been developed, including: replacement of all windows; upgrades to existing restroom facilities and other building systems including fire alarms; installation of energy efficient HVAC equipment, lighting and lighting controls; roof replacement; and implementation of photo-voltaic solar cell arrays on the South roof and a green roof above space on the first floor.  Additional work may be added at a later date using separate funding for tenant improvements.  

The guaranteed maximum price for this project is $42,000,000 based on FY10 funding for combined services (Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work).  The North American Industry Classification System Code(s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The project will be designed and constructed in Metric Units of Measure.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step and Source Selection procedures per FAR Part 15.
At the time of contract award, the project will be in the early phases of design.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process.  At any time during or after design phase services, the Contracting Officer may request that CMc provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to convert the Contract to a firm-fixed-price contract at the offered price or as otherwise negotiated by the parties to this Contract, so long as such price is less than or equal to the GMP.  If the parties to this Contract negotiate and establish a firm-fixed-price prior to the exercise of the Construction Phase Work Option, then the Contracting Officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the firm-fixed-price option within 60 calendar days of the establishment of that price.

Design Phase Services include, and are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development documents; review and evaluation of the Architect of Record construction document submissions for constructability; review and evaluation of all Architect of Record cost estimates; reconciliation of all cost estimates; participation in all construction document team meetings; value engineering suggestions; identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documents; consultation during design document production; preliminary project schedule development; identification of long-lead items, independent pricing of design document phase and construction document phase submittals; preliminary cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and, establishment of firm-fixed pricing.  The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the facility, should the Option for Construction Phase Services be awarded.
Construction Phase Work includes, and are not limited to, construction alterations to the building; project scope management; selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors; administration of the construction contract (how much work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract); administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; conducting and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; participation of Alternative Dispute Resolution partnering consultant; coordination of commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures; and, all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable building.
The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA's Construction Manager as-agent; GSA's selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA's building commissioning firm; GSA's security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.
A source selection/greatest value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being approximately equal to price.  

This is an advisory two step procurement process.  In 
Stage 1, offerors will present their price proposals and technical qualifications by submitting the following information: price proposal, bonding certification for the ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, general contractor’s business license, and technical factors consisting of: 1) Experience and Past Performance, 2) Key Personnel Qualifications and Experience, 3) Project Management Plan and 4) Project Specific Knowledge.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  In Stage 2, those Offerors included in the competitive range shall be interviewed.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

A pre-proposal conference providing instructions for the submission of technical and price proposals will be conducted at the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, VA on or about 07/16/09.  The exact date and time of this conference will be contained in the solicitation package.  Please email Ms. Kimberly DeSant at kim.desant@gsa.gov to confirm your attendance.  The solicitation will be available on or about 07/07/09.  Interested parties may download their own copy of these documents.  These documents will be in .pdf format and may be accessed on a World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.fbo.gov .  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this website for the release of any amendments and to download their own copy of any amendments.  This site provides instructions for downloading the amendment file(s).  

Interested Offerors are required to submit bonding certification of their ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, and are required to be licensed general contractors.  Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and six (6) copies of the required technical and price information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors. 

Interested firms must send their submittal, no later than 3:00 PM EST on 08/06/09, to Kimberly DeSant, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Allegheny Service Center (3PK), The Strawbridge Building, 20 North 8th Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19107.  Prior to award of this contract to a large business, an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required in accordance with FAR Part 19, which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: small business concerns (Goal 37%), hubzone small business concerns (Goal 3%), small disadvantaged business concerns (Goal 6%), women-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%), veteran-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%) and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (3%).  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with            FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  This procurement is being solicited through full and open competition procedures under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  The NAICS CODE is 236220.

<DESC>These  following items are being planned to be purchased to implement the FACET Timing System at SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryThis hardware is for new and upgraded accelerator systems that are being installed to support the operation of FACET. . These new subsystems include accelerator instrumentation and controls as well as experimental data acquisition systems.

The Timing System (also called the Event System) is responsible for generating triggers for the new and upgraded subsystems of the FACET accelerator complex. These triggers are used to start, stop and sequence the operation of all of the integral subsystems that make up FACET. These subsystems include magnets for beam steering, BPMs, Wire Scanners, Profile Monitors, other diagnostics as well as experimental data acquisition systems. The triggers going to these subsystems are generated by the Event System, which in turn are generated by the hardware being purchased as well as other existing components. These triggers are required to occur at the proper time, synchronized and conditioned to signals from other parts of the accelerator including the master clock and a special data stream used to signify different conditions within the accelerator. A mechanism is required to combine these signals in the proper order and synchronize the resulting output triggers to the accelerator master clock. This mechanism is the Event System. The requirements for the event system include synchronization to the Linac Accelerator master 476MHz clock, and a trigger time jitter of no greater than 10ps.

Items 

The Micro Research Finland  components for contemplated purchase have the following functions:

VME-EVG-230: This is the Event Generator (EVG) and is the timing system master. It broadcasts timing information over a distributed fiber network to the Event Receivers (EVRs) . The EVG interfaces with the existing accelerator systems (clock, PNET, triggers) and forms the trigger commands that are sent to the EVRs.

VME-EVR-230: This is the Event Receiver (EVR), it receives a fiber from the fanout unit and generates triggers based in information sent thru the fiber. It can produce 14 triggers and has a timing jitter performance of 10ps, which is required for specific diagnostic systems. In addition, it has special programmable outputs, which are used to create customized triggers.

PMC-EVR-200: This is another type of Event Receiver, it is similar in function to the VME-EVR-230, except that it has fewer outputs, a looser jitter specification (25ps) and is more compact. It is used in instances where fewer triggers are needed in a more compact package with average jitter performance.

VME-UNIV-TB: This is a transition board that is used to bring the physical trigger signals out of the EVR and over to the subsystem being triggered. This module interfaces the physical triggers to the designated subsystem. This module requires seven small 2-channel daughterboards (the UNIV-TTL) to provide the 14 output triggers.

UNIV-TTL: This is a small 2-channel trigger output board that is meant to be mounted onto the VME-UNIV-TB module for a complete output transition module. Note that (7) UNIV-TTL modules per one VME-UNIT-TB are required to create the full 14-channel output triggers per EVR module.

VME-FOUT-12: Receives timing information transmitted from the event master on a fiber optical cable and retransmits this information across 12 fibers to awaiting Event Receivers.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the availability of contractor's with the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  This capability statement will be used to determine the overall procurement strategy.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for vegetation maintenance services to control the growth of nonnative plant species on approximately 253-266 acres of shallow water areas, transition zones and upland zones at Hart Mine Marsh (HMM), located at the southern end of Cibola National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona.  Maintenance on this area will be required for a 2 year term.  The Government is including 3 Option Provisions in this acquisition, each with a 12 month performance period.   The Options may or may not be invoked depending on need and on available funding.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 561730 - Landscaping Services.   The small business size standard for NAICS Code 561730 is $7 million. 
The successful awardee will be required starting in the spring of 2010 to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision needed to maintain Hart Mine Marsh's construction foot print.   When the formal solicitation issue, it will require all offerors to submit a Marsh Vegetation Maintenance plan that clearly demonstrates previous experience doing this type of work in the Lower Colorado Region and display knowledge of herbicides, salt tolerant native species and other plant species in this area. The maintenance plan should also detail the techniques (i.e., hand cutting, weeding, herbicide application, etc.) to be used to control establishment and encroachment of nonnative species within the planted areas and provide a schedule with details of control efforts, activities and timing of these activities.  Control activities may be variable throughout the growing season; however the aggressive and invasive nature of nonnative species will likely dictate frequent control intervals. Invasive species control will enable native species to adequately colonize the marsh and develop into the desired marsh habitats.  
Firms interested in this effort are invited to submit capability statements in response to this request. The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and demonstrated responsibility in performing the principal components of work listed above.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division - Orlando (NAWCTSD-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with the Bell Boeing Joint Program Office (BB JPO) located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $78.5M.  The supplies to be procured under this ID/IQ include the acquisition of the following: two Air Force (CV-22) Flight Training Devices (FTDs), Serial Numbers 5 and 6; one Marine Corps (MV-22) Cabin Part Task Trainer (CPTT), Serial Number 1; the system upgrades to CV-22 FTDs 1 through 6; the system upgrades to CV-22 Full Flight Simulator (FFS) Devices 1 and 2; and the provisioned items and spares required to implement the V-22  FTD, CPTT and FFS training systems.  The BB JPO has been the sole designer, developer, weapons system integrator, and producer of the MV-22 and CV-22 type/model/series aircraft.  As such, Bell Boeing is the only responsible source possessing the engineering data, technical skills, requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, and operational characteristics of the V-22 aircraft.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, BB JPO has developed and built all V-22 aircrew and maintenance trainers acquired to date.  BB JPO creates V-22 aircraft systems software and modifies the aircraft’s System Configuration Set (SCS) to include Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) (e.g. JASS) software. BB JPO provides software for design, engineering simulations, and operational evaluation that are used in the redesign of the V-22 aircraft.  These redesigned subsystem models are used to develop and test the SCS/OFP and are an essential element used in the development of V-22 aircraft and training systems.  The complexity and evolving nature of the V-22 aircraft requires that training systems and training are developed and implemented concurrently with the aircraft.  Aircrew and maintenance training systems need to provide a robust, dynamic and accurate representation of the delivered aircraft and associated subsystems prior to or when delivered to the fleet.  BB JPO needs to replicate the performance of the aircraft systems and enable the production, revision, test, evaluation and acceptance of the training capability in order to deliver the required training capability concurrent with the aircraft development/production.  The V-22 training system is designed and developed based on parallel and spiral efforts contracted under the aircraft procurement program resulting in training devices that are unique stand-alone and concurrent with the aircraft.  These devices essentially represent exact replicas of the aircraft or portions of the aircraft.  This requirement to accurately and concurrently represent the aircraft and aircraft systems necessitates a sole source relationship with the aircraft OEM.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Cynthia Sherman, cynthia.sherman@navy.mil  in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than 20 November 2009 at 1630.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than five (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  If no affirmative written response is received, the ID/IQ contract for the V-22 Training Aircraft Program will be awarded without further notice.

The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to, Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is February 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast region, the government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Points of Contact: Paul McCarty, (706) 787-2094, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil , or Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil .<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods - Wrist, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $149,814.65.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Paul McCarty, (706) 787-2094, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil , or Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.   Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process. <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified in Phase I or Phase II will be notified in writing (via email) at the conclusion of the evaluation process which is DSCP approval and the signing of the agreement by the final authority.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions / quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Paul McCarty, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil , or Mike Tierney, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:    <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Wrist products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.

(Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>4.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Med/Surg prime vendor in the Southeast Region for Orthopedic Soft Goods  Wrist (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor).  Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>5.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Note vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>1.	Vendors MUST provide Orthopedic Soft Goods  Wrist products that are Latex free/ Latex safe. Vendors who do not provide Latex Free/ Latex Safe Orthopedic Soft Goods  Wrist products will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the Clinical Product Team members at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facility by COB, 5:00PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.<BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for seven (7) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP final approval).<BR>Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  The TRBO will notify all qualified/invited vendors of their products arrival.  Vendors WILL NOT need to require signature to verify delivery. Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  <BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	NPSG.13.01 (EP1)  Encourage [patient]s involvement in their own care as a [patient] safety strategy.  The products should provide a satisfactory level of patient comfort-<BR>a.	Comfort is necessary for appropriate and consistent use by the patient.<BR>b.	Evaluator will apply and inspect the products to assess for level of fit comfort.<BR>2.	NPSG.13.01 (EP1)  Encourage [patient]s involvement in their own care as a [patient] safety strategy.  The products should be made of durable materials that are adequate for supporting the affected area. <BR>a.	Orthopedic soft goods need to be durably constructed to provide support throughout the prescribed application period.<BR>b.	The evaluator will apply and inspect the product to assess for durability.<BR>3.	NPSG.13.01 (EP1)  Encourage [patient]s involvement in their own care as a [patient] safety strategy.  The product should remain securely positioned on the intended area. <BR>a.	The product must remain secure to provide intended support.<BR>b.	The evaluator will apply the product and assess that it remains secure in the intended position.<BR>4.	NPSG.13.01 (EP1)  Encourage [patient]s involvement in their own care as a [patient] safety strategy. The product should only require minimal effort for application. <BR>a.	To assure the appropriate and consistent use of the product by the patient, it must be easy to apply.<BR>b.	While applying and removing the product, the evaluator will assess the ease of application.<BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/ invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.	  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) period from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor and (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 27 NOVEMBER 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR>

<p>This acquisition will be made under a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) as there is only one responsible source. The JOFOC is per FAR part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The steel in plate making at the BEP must be free of impurities. If impurities are present in the material, the material will fail the inspection process. Redding Steel meets the manufacturer's specifications of heat treating. Prior testing on other sources of steel has proved inadequate quality of steel other then the steel provided by Redding Steel LLC. In order for the BEP to maintain ISO certification, it is necessary to acquire steel from Redding Steel LLC.</p>

FAR 6.302-1 (c) Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand name justification. (Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.)

<CONTACT>Ted Mahoney, Phone 202-420-8293, Fax 360-326-3415, Email ted.mahoney@gsa.gov
<DESC><p dir="ltr">This synopsis publicizes for follow on contract actions proposed to support the General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Office of Real Estate Acquisition, Center for Real Estate Brokerage Services, National Broker Contracts (NBC) Program. The current contracts were awarded by GSA on October 4, 2004, to a limited number of broker service contracts under one national contract program. These contracts were issued Notice to Proceed on April 1, 2005 and contained 4 option years. The 4th option has been exercised and will expire March 31, 2010. The purpose of these contracts was to provide continuation of transaction support for lease acquisition services under the GSA Leasing Program. These services consist of those actions required to support GSA's Lease Contracting Officers as a tool to provide consistent, high-quality services nationwide to federal agencies that rely on GSA for lease acquisition. In order to continue this objective, the NBC program proposes again to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts utilizing no appropriated funds, under which task orders may be issued and contractors will be compensated via the private sector practice of commission payments. These no appropriated fund contracts are unique to GSA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, task orders may be awarded for Full Lease Acquisition Support services or Extension Support Services. Additionally, the NBC may be called upon to provide market data information related to the NBC Program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The proposed contract period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods. The total programmatic requirements expected to be awarded under the NBC contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $100,830,563 of commission opportunity. The Government will conduct a single competition for award of multiple ID/IQ contracts requiring no appropriated funds to support this program's requirements on an unrestricted competitive basis. The total commission opportunity capacity will be shared amongst all awardees. A more detailed description of the acquisition strategy will be provided in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A DRAFT solicitation is being prepared to issue for industry review and comment. All questions and comments on any released draft solicitation must be submitted in accordance with the synopsis modification when issued. Submitted comments will be taken into consideration before issuance of the official solicitation. The draft solicitation will be made available to interested parties through the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov, as a modification to this synopsis. A pre proposal conference will also be conducted. Further information on any conferences will be provided as a modification to this synopsis. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the solicitation requirements. Offerors anticipating proposing a small business-led team, joint venture, or another form of teaming arrangement should review, in consultation with legal counsel, the Small Business Administration's (SBA) size eligibility standards found at Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 121 (13 CFR 121). In particular, Offerors proposing a joint venture, or another form of teaming arrangement should review 13 CFR121.103, "What is affiliation?" Vendors, who download the solicitation, when posted, are requested to contact the Contracting Officer, Ted Mahoney, via email at Ted.Mahoney@gsa.gov with questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Significant evaluation factors for award are anticipated to include: Experience<strong>,</strong> Technical, Management, Past Performance, Small Business Participation and Subcontracting Plan, and Price. Awards are anticipated to be made in early calendar year 2010.</p>

<DESC>Re:	VISN 18 ARK ICU CIS Meeting                                     	December 4, 2009	Phoenix VA Health Care System   Ambulatory Care Conference Rooms	650 E. Indian School Road	Phoenix, AZ 85012Dear Vendor Representatives:VA Southwest Health Care Network (VISN 18) is inviting prospective vendors who can provide integrated anesthesia record keeper systems and intensive care unit clinical information systems to a meeting at the Phoenix VA Health Care System on December 4, 2009. VISN 18 is only interested in vendors that can provide both types of systems and that can demonstrate that the two systems are tightly integrated. Meeting objectives for VISN 18 participants are to understand and become familiar with commercial off-the-shelf clinical information system products and to conduct market research to understand clinical features and functions commonly available in modern commercial offerings for ICU Clinical Information Systems (ICU CIS), Anesthesia Record Keeping Systems (ARK), and Virtual-ICU technologies. Attendees will identify functional requirements for VISN 18 systems. Your participation will help educate our staff about modern systems so that we may refine our system requirements. Please Note: We consider this meeting to be "market research." We are not "evaluating" your products against other vendors' products. Rather, we seek to identify important features and functions to VISN 18 that are commonly available in commercial product offerings. You should neither consider your company as favored in any fashion by VISN 18, nor should you consider VISN 18 under any obligation to your company as a result of your participation in this meeting. VISN 18 intends to formally solicit proposals from multiple sources within the next several months from some or all vendors participating in this meeting as well as other vendors. While interacting with VA staff, you may find it beneficial to know their role (physician, nurse, ICU or anesthesia, Biomedical Engineering, etc). However, you should have no need to capture and retain names of VA personnel. Should VA personnel request additional or follow up information, please refer them to VISN Project Leadership and/or furnish the information via Carlos Leon, VISN 18 Contracting Officer. Mr. Leon will then share the information with VA staff as appropriate.  Logistical InformationWe will provide Conference Rooms and they will be available from 7:30 AM on December 4, 2009.  The meeting will run until 4 PM. We ask that your representatives wear name badges identifying name and company at all times.   You may hand out brochures and other literature. Any electronic files should be given to the contracting officer for distribution to VISN 18 staff. The audience for these presentations will include Nurses, Physicians, Anesthesiologists, CNRAs, Clinical Applications Coordinators, Biomedical Engineering, IT Contracting, Administrators, and other stakeholders. Please be prepared to present on the topics below, as appropriate:"	High level executive summary of your product offerings "	ICU CIS product and Virtual ICU product overviews, including clinical champion remotely using system (25 minutes or less)  "	Anesthesia Record Keeping product overviews (25 minutes or less)"	Hands-on demonstrations of products"	Technical discussion including an overview of system architecture (hardware, operating system, database, application), medical device interfacing, network requirements (LAN, Wireless, WAN), and VistA interfaces (30 minutes)Note:Vendors will be responsible for all travel cost. The VA will not reimburse any cost incurred by the vendor for this meeting.   Your VA contacts for all questions are: Primary Point of Contact: 	Carlos LeonVISN 18 Contracting Officer carlos.leon@va.gov 915-564-6153 Secondary Points of Contact: Jane MitchellPhoenix Biomedical Engineer jane.mitchell@va.gov 602-222-6460Mervin L.

The project is currently authorized  ___14,399___ gross SF of addition and    7,035    gross SF of alteration, _1_ story building in   Great Falls   ,    MT   , with a project budget of $7.6 million.  The facility is expected to be comprised of approximately  _6_% classrooms, _10_% office space,_19_% stand alone maintenance shop, _2_ % weapons area, _7_% storage area, etc..  See attached Architectural program provided by Lheureux Page Werner, PC.<BR>The current phase of the project is: __Conceptual Design.  The construction documents are planned to be completed by ___15 May 2010______. Construction is anticipated to begin in __June 2010______ and final occupancy by __September 2011___. The Project document available for review is the 15% conceptual design submittal.<BR>Objectives<BR><BR>The objective of commissioning is to provide documented confirmation that a facility fulfills the functional and performance requirements of the building owner, occupants, and operators.  To reach this goal, it is necessary for the commissioning process to establish and document the owners criteria for system function, performance, and maintainability (aka Owners Project Requirements- OPR); and to also verify and document compliance with these criteria throughout design, construction, start-up, and the initial period of operation.  In addition, complete operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals, as well as training on system operation, should be provided to the building operators to ensure the building continues to operate as intended.<BR>The Commissioning Authority (CxA) should be involved throughout the project from the pre-design through the warranty phase.   The primary role of the CxA during the overall design phase is to develop detailed commissioning specifications and review the design to ensure it meets the Owners objectives.  During construction, the CxA develops and coordinates the execution of a testing plan, which includes observing and documenting all systems performance to ensure that the systems are functioning in accordance with the Owners Project Requirements (OPR) and the contract documents. The CxA is not responsible for design or general construction scheduling, cost estimating, or construction management, but may assist with problem-solving or resolving non-conformance issues or deficiencies.<BR>Scope of Work<BR>The CxA shall be responsible for carrying out the following tasks and all requirements specified for Enhanced Commissioning according to the US Green Building Council.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380 THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10078 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-37.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541380 and the business size standard is $12.0 million. Full and Open Competition will be utilized for this procurement.  A firm fixed price contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12 is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.  EPA obtains the filters each year from a contractor and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing. 
The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the EPA distributes the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The EPA, at a minimum, requires the follwing services. 
Requirement:   A. Quartz Fiber Filter Selection and Testing.  The Contractor shall use the following test methods to check the filters:  1) American Society of Testing Methods (ASTM) Method D645-92 (Standard Test Method for Thickness of Paper and Paperboard); 2)  EMSL/EPA/RTP Hi Vol Filter Flow Rate Acceptance Test for Quartz Filters for the SSI Samplers; 3) Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory (AREAL)  Visual Inspection Test for Quartz Filters: 4)  ASTM Method D2986-91 (Standard Practice for Evaluation of Air Assay Media by the Monodisperse DOP (Dioctyl Phthalate) Smoke Test.  B. Quartz Fiber Filters.  475 filters from each batch of quartz fiber filters, where a batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, shall be selected for acceptance testing by the physical tests described below.  
All filters shall be subjected to the visual inspection test and then a certain number shall be subject to the other tests described in Attachment 1 (Please see the following website: http;//www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd).  C.  Distribution.  After the acceptance testing is completed on the filters, the contractor shall distribute approximately 21,000 glass fiber filters (from a previous order) and approximately 65,000 quartz filters as soon as the testing has been completed and the filters are determined to be acceptable by EPA.After the CY-2010 filters are distributed, it is anticipated that approximately 7,000 glass (form a previous order) and 23,400 quartz filters remain.  
The contractor shall store the remaining filters until the Project Officer (PO) notifies the Contractor in writing to (a) send to State/local agencies whose filters were damaged in shipment; and (b) ship approximately 21,000 glass fiber filters and approximately 65,000 quartz filters to State/local agencies approximately January 2010.  The contractor shall also store the remaining filters from this mail-out.The glass fiber and quartz filters shall be shipped by the contractor after transferring the appropriate number of filter boxes from the manufacturer?s shipping cases to boxes provided by the contractor for distribution of the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies nationwide.  
The contractor shall never ship a partial box, and the smallest quantity of filters to be shipped to any location shall be one box.  EPA will provide the contractor a master letter and copies of the letter to include one copy in each shipment to the agencies.  If a State/local agency receives the filters from the Contractor in a condition where contamination is suspected due to a shipping mishap and the Contractor is notified, the Contractor shall immediately notify EPA to get written consent to ship another set of filters to the participant.  
Deliverables:   The Contractor shall submit all test results to the EPA within 5 days after completing the acceptance testing procedures.  The Contract shall ship the filters to the designated State/Local Agencies within 5 days after notification.  The Contractor shall store the remaining filters for up to 24 months.  Evaluation Criteria:   The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered.  
For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the following evaluation criteria:  1) The Contractor shall submit a technical approach that demonstrates an understanding of the statement of work; proposed accomplishments by task and conclusion of each task.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS
<p>TO PROVIDE GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONCRETE PAD FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AN EXPLOSIVE STORAGE MAGAZINE AT LUIS MUNOZ MARIN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SJU)<br /><br />1.0 Purpose</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) National Explosive Detection Canine Team Program (NEDCTP) is committed to establishing safe, secure repositories for training equipment related to the Proprietary Canine Program. To this end, NEDCTP desires to install and maintain an explosives magazine at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport. To achieve this goal, NEDCTP requires this site be prepared for receipt and installation of this magazine.</p>
<p>1.1 Background</p>
<p>TSA is contracting with airports to install explosives storage magazine facilities to be located on or near airport grounds. Each facility will house explosive storage magazine(s) that will safely and securely hold the TSA-approved explosive training aids which are required to train and maintain the proficiency of the TSA explosives detector canines.</p>
<p>This effort comprises constructing a concrete pad, installing a grounding rod, an encompassing barricade, erecting enclosure fencing, access gate, and associated lighting if necessary. These deliverables are to meet requirements set forth in ATF 5400.7. http://www.atf.gov/explarson/fedexplolaw/2007edition/index.htm</p>
<p>1.2 Technical Requirements/Task</p>

This pad is to be located adjacent to an existing concrete pad at the airport site.</p>
<p>Task 4: The contractor shall install a .75 inch by ten (10) foot grounding rod. This grounding rod is to be compliant with (NFPA) code requirements.</p>
<p>Task 5: The contractor shall install four (4) twelve (12) foot solar light poles. Placement of the light poles are to be two (2) per concrete pad and are to be placed so as to provide the maximum amount of light to the work area located between each magazine, as well as to the entrance of each magazine.</p>
<p>Task 6: The contractor shall construct a concrete table, approximately three (3) feet by six (6) feet, approximately three (3) inches in thickness reinforced with rebar, at standard table height (approximately 30 inches). The table will sit on four (4) cinder block legs set at each end. This table shall be placed on the side of the concrete pad adjacent to the existing pad. Additionally, the contractor shall install a simple aluminum or steel roof to cover the table. <br />Task 7: The contractor shall erect enclosure fencing and access gate.

<p>(a) Definition.-"Site of the work"-</p>
<p>(1) Means--</p>
<p>(i) The primary site of the work. The physical place or places where the construction called for in the contract will remain when work on it is completed; and</p>
<p>(ii) The secondary site of the work, if any. Any other site where a significant portion of the building or work is constructed, provided that such site is-</p>
<p>(A) Located in the United States; and</p>
<p>(B) Established specifically for the performance of the contract or project;</p>
<p>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this definition, includes any fabrication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., provided-</p>
<p>(i) They are dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to performance of the contract or project; and</p>
<p>(ii) They are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the "primary site of the work" as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i), or the "secondary site of the work" as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this definition;</p>
<p>(3) Does not include permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, or tool yards of a Contractor or subcontractor whose locations and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, yards, etc., of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the Project site, are not included in the "site of the work." Such permanent, previously established facilities are not a part of the "site of the work" even if the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively or nearly so, to the performance of a contract.</p>
<p>(b) (1) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR Part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or <br />cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor <br />that are transporting portions of the building or work between the secondary site of the work and the primary site of the work shall be paid in accordance with the wage determination applicable to the primary site of the work.</p>
<p>(2) Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or <br />costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such period.</p>
<p>(3) Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in <br />more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided, that the employer's payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed.</p>
<p>(4) The wage determination (including any additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (c) of this clause) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers.</p>
<p>(c) (1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when all the following criteria have been met:</p>
<p>(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination.</p>
<p>(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry.</p>
<p>(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.</p>
<p>(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by <br />the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Division <br />Employment Standards Administration <br />U.S. Department of Labor <br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.</p>
<p>(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.</p>
<p>(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification.</p>
<p>(d) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.</p>
<p>(e) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, That the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>*NEW INFORMATION ADDED ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009 - PLEASE NOT THAT NO ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY STATEMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE*

The Federal Transit Administration is currently reviewing the Capability Statements received as a result of this Sources Sought.   An effort is being made to ascertain the appropriate procurement strategy.   Therefore, upon identification of the appropriate strategy we will proceed accordingly and all further announcements will be posted to FedBizOpps.  Thank you.

============================================================================

The following information serves as Amendment # 1 to Sources Sought Solicitation FTA-09-0529.  The questions and answers posted below have come in as a result of the initial posting and ALL REMAINING QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO CHANEL.WINSTON@DOT.GOV NO LATER THAN 12 NOON, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 2009.  

A second amendment will be posted with the remaining questions and answers on Tuesday, July 7, 2009.

Lastly, PLEASE NOTE THAT A VENDOR’S LIST WILL NOT BE COMPILED AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.  Therefore, if your firm is interested in responding to this notice, please submit your Capabilities Statement as detailed within the solicitation.

==================================================================
1) The specific requirement for this Sources Sought is that the respondent be a small business in order to be considered.  The applicant would be bringing on as a teaming partner, a subcontractor with both a MOBIS and an IT 70 contract - and though the sub is currently under $15M in size, they are above the small business limit for the 541611 NAICS.  Could you advise if this type of relationship is eligible for consideration?  
 
Subcontractors do not have to be small businesses. However, be aware that the prime contractor must do at least 51% of the billable work.
 
2) Is the master's degree a firm requirement in the job description or can experience in lieu of education be substituted?
 
Experience can be substituted for the Master’s degree.  Applicant must, however, have a bachelor’s degree in a related field.
 
3) Is the overall scope of this effort concerning performance management of IT Applications and systems or performance management.  Performance management is also a term used in business to describe things like financial performance.
 
Yes. The overall objective here is to implement an IT system to support performance management.  Potential contractors will need to demonstrate expertise in performance management first, and the ability to understand the limitations and capabilities of IT systems second.  We are looking for a team that can do both.

FTA collects data on program outcomes and outputs to meet DOT requirements and for internal performance improvement purposes.  For example, we measure how long it takes us to issue grants (our goal is to average less than 36 days) because we once had complaints that it took too long.  We also count the number of rides people take on transit systems around the country (we have a goal to increase this by at least 1.5% per year).  We have around 20 measures of things like that, with the data being collected in different systems around the agency.  Some may involve financial performance (responding to audits) or be safety related (injuries and fatalities).  This is performance management in its broadest sense.  We collect the data manually now and would like to automate the collection and display to save time.

4) Is this sources sought a follow-on from a related contract.  If so, would you be able to provide the contractor, contract #, and contract value. 
 
This is a new activity and is unlike previous procurements, thus the sources sought notice.
 
5) Will the eventual RFP (if any) come out under a MOBIS vehicle?  I ask because at your $7M size standard requirement, our small business is only qualified to bid if it is a MOBIS based competition.   
 
We are not sure of our procurement strategy at this point.  If we choose to use the GSA list it will be a MOBIS vehicle.  If we decide we can use a disadvantaged small business, we will not need to designate it as MOBIS. 
 

6) Would it be possible to understand what current software packages are already in place to build the performance management portal?  Or is that purchase part of the eventual solicitation?
 
We currently call the database owner who queries his data system and emails us the results. We paste it into an Excel chart and then into a Word document which gets converted to Adobe format and posted on our intranet.  Data originally comes from TEAM, OTrack, and the National Transit Database (an Oracle application).
 
7) Is this requirement self-generated by FTA or did a vendor or consultant recommend FTA take this course of action?  

Self-generated

8) Would the FTA program manager or CO allow us to come in and make a presentation?

No.  If you are interested in presenting your firm, please submit a Capabilities Statement.


9) Is there a specific schedule for how the FTA will determine if it proceeds with an RFP or RFQ?

No.  How we proceed depends on the nature of the responses.

10) Would the FTA consider using GSA MOBIS as the contracting vehicle for this study and advice?

Yes, if we identify providers in this process that are on the GSA MOBIS schedule and determine that procurement by this vehicle provides the best value to the government.
 
11) Does FTA plan on distributing tasks 1 and 2 as separate solicitations? (b) If FTA does anticipate releasing two separate solicitations, will there be any conflict of interest issues regarding implementing both tasks? 

Yes. We expect to issue two separate solicitations, one to develop a plan for the data collection and display system and another to implement and pilot the system.  To insure objectivity in the planning process we will not select the same contractor for both solicitations.  FTA will prepare initial requirements and purchase necessary software licenses.  We are looking for qualified small businesses to bid on both solicitations.

<DESC>The solicitation will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about November 19, 2009.   PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number will be  issued as doccument number N9512090037.  The National Park Service, Olympic National Park, has a requirement for fire and security alarm system design, construction, maintenance, and monitoring of thirteen structures in the Headquarters Area of Olympic National Park.  All thirteen structures require a fire alarm system.  Seven of the thirteen structures also require a security alarm system.   Four of the thirteen structures are historic and will require consultation with the park's Historical Architect during the design and installation phases.  The intent of this project is for an experienced contractor to provide the design, and perform the work necessary to complete fire and security alarm system upgrades and installation, as well as system maintenance and monitoring, under a single contract; which will include 24/hour-7-day-a-week monitoring for one base year plus four option years, as a separate line item from the initial design and installation work.  The work is to be accomplished at Olympic National Park, Headquarters Complex, Port Angeles, Clallam County, Washington.   This procurement is a Request for Quotations (RFQ) subject to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12, 13 and 17.   This RFQ will result in award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract for one base year plus four option years.  In addition, this RFQ was originally issued as a small business set-aside.  The  previous amendment (E951209D037) changed the set-aside from "small business"  to "full and open."  That change was incorrect and made in error.  This acquisition is not full and open, and is hereby changed back to the original "Small Business Set-Aside."  Small businesses concerns are encouraged submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 561621.  The small business size standard is $12.5 million (average annual gross receipts over past three years).   All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.204-07 Central Contractor Registration.  Offerors must also be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database at http://orca.bpn.gov, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items."  POINT OF CONTACT:  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation is Ed Mckee, Olympic National Park, 600 East Park Avenue, Port Angeles, WA 98362. E-Mail:  Ed_McKee@ nps.gov.   Telephone number is 360-565-3025.  Responses will be due approximately forty-five (45) days following issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>The following synopsis is amended to include an updated ceiling value of $300M (initial amount was $250M).  Also, direct source Foreign Military Sales (FMS) efforts have been included with the requirement.  The ordering period has been updated from a base of five years with three one year options (totaling eight years) to a base of five years with five one year options (totaling ten years).  There are no other changes other than the response date.
 
The synopsis now reads:

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) for the F/A-18C/D Roadmap Procurement Program (RPP) with L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3), Arlington, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $300M with a base five year ordering period with five additional one year options if the ceiling has not been exhausted. The F/A-18C/D RPP IDIQ will provide for the acquisition, modification and upgrades of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and for the modification and upgrade of F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) hardware and software components that are common with F/A-18C/D TOFT components to maximize capabilities amongst platforms.  The F/A-18C/D RPP will also provide for directed procurement by Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers for the acquisition of F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and common components.  L-3 developed and built the existing twenty-six F/A-18C/D Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) training systems and provided upgrades and modifications for Software Configuration Set (SCS) 19C and 20X, Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) interoperability, Brief/Debrief Stations, Mission Operation Centers, image generators and visual databases.  The F/A-18C/D training systems’ requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, (to include, but not limited to 21X, 23X, 25X, 27X) and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the F/A-18C/D aircraft development roadmap that support training in the full mission spectrum from planning through mission rehearsal including individual through joint interoperability levels encompassing events in the initial strike fighter training syllabus, Strike Aircraft Training and Readiness Matrix (T&R), Air Combat Training Continuum (ACTC), and events associated with Inter-Deployment Readiness Cycle (IDRC).  Any new F/A-18C/D training systems, modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded F/A-18C/D systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor.  The FA-18C/D RPP IDIQ will also focus on reducing cost of ownership by optimizing existing hardware and software commonality across all FA-18 and EA-18G TOFTs through the extensive use of common interfaces, data structures, hardware and software constructs.  As a subcontractor, L-3 provided hardware and software components for the thirteen F/A-18E/F TOFTs and the three EA-18G TOFTs that are common with the F/A-18C/D TOFTs.  These components include, but are not limited to the Instructor Operator Station, Brief/Debrief Station, visual database, image generators, host computers and interoperability of these devices with each other.  Common TOFT component modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development due to restricted rights and limited data rights. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.  A competitive acquisition would allow for a new system to be introduced to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award under the Training System Contract (TSC) II multiple award IDIQ at NAWCTSD.  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current TOFT design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing TOFTs.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G TOFTs, only L-3 possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and to maximize the capabilities amongst the F/A-18 platforms to include F/A-18E/F and EA-18G TOFT common component acquisitions, modifications and upgrades within the Government’s requisite delivery schedule.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Government’s intent to contract on a sole source basis with L-3.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain F/A-18 C/D technical data, and any other information, that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Holly DeFord (holly.deford@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 9 October 2009. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, the IDIQ Contract for the F/A-18C/D RPP will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

<DESC>The following synopsis is amended to include an updated ceiling value of $500M (revised from $300M posted on September 23, 2009). This update is a result of more accurate estimates of US Navy, Marine Corps, and FMS direct sourced requirements. There are no other changes other than the response date.
 
The synopsis now reads:

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) for the F/A-18C/D Roadmap Procurement Program (RPP) with L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3), Arlington, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $500M with a base five year ordering period with five additional one year options if the ceiling has not been exhausted. The F/A-18C/D RPP IDIQ will provide for the acquisition, modification and upgrades of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and for the modification and upgrade of F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) hardware and software components that are common with F/A-18C/D TOFT components to maximize capabilities amongst platforms.  The F/A-18C/D RPP will also provide for directed procurement by Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers for the acquisition of F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and common components.  L-3 developed and built the existing twenty-six F/A-18C/D Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) training systems and provided upgrades and modifications for Software Configuration Set (SCS) 19C and 20X, Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) interoperability, Brief/Debrief Stations, Mission Operation Centers, image generators and visual databases.  The F/A-18C/D training systems’ requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, (to include, but not limited to 21X, 23X, 25X, 27X) and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the F/A-18C/D aircraft development roadmap that support training in the full mission spectrum from planning through mission rehearsal including individual through joint interoperability levels encompassing events in the initial strike fighter training syllabus, Strike Aircraft Training and Readiness Matrix (T&R), Air Combat Training Continuum (ACTC), and events associated with Inter-Deployment Readiness Cycle (IDRC).  Any new F/A-18C/D training systems, modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded F/A-18C/D systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor.  The FA-18C/D RPP IDIQ will also focus on reducing cost of ownership by optimizing existing hardware and software commonality across all FA-18 and EA-18G TOFTs through the extensive use of common interfaces, data structures, hardware and software constructs.  As a subcontractor, L-3 provided hardware and software components for the thirteen F/A-18E/F TOFTs and the three EA-18G TOFTs that are common with the F/A-18C/D TOFTs.  These components include, but are not limited to the Instructor Operator Station, Brief/Debrief Station, visual database, image generators, host computers and interoperability of these devices with each other.  Common TOFT component modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development due to restricted rights and limited data rights. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.  A competitive acquisition would allow for a new system to be introduced to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award under the Training System Contract (TSC) II multiple award IDIQ at NAWCTSD.  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current TOFT design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing TOFTs.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G TOFTs, only L-3 possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and to maximize the capabilities amongst the F/A-18 platforms to include F/A-18E/F and EA-18G TOFT common component acquisitions, modifications and upgrades within the Government’s requisite delivery schedule.

Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.</p>

Relevant Past Performance / Corporate Experience; 2. Key Personnel Qualifications / Organizational Chart; 3. Project Management Plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Step 2 will consist of a Request for Proposal in which the following technical factors will be evaluated: 1. Subcontractors; 2. Project Schedule; 3. Construction Alternatives; 4. Small Disadvantaged Business (SBD) Participation; In addition, a price proposal will be requested as part of Step 2. Separate technical and price proposals will be required.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project period of performance will be 24 months and the estimated price for this requirement is more than $10,000,000.00.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The solicitation can only be obtained by accessing the Federal Business <br />Opportunities website (FedBizOpps - https://www.fbo.gov). It is fully integrated with other electronic Government initiatives such as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal Agencies.

<DESC><p>A number of US firms have asked additional questions to ANP regarding the feasibility study. We have received the following response from ANP. Unfortunately, they have provided the answers only in French.</p>
<p>1. (Section 1: INTRODUCTION, 1.1 BACKGROUND SUMMARY): Is it the customer's intent to make the use of "underwater inspection and diver detection sonar equipment" a requirement for the implementation of a Security and Surveillance System, or are these merely examples?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : L'utilisation d'un sonar pour l'inspection sous marine et la d&eacute;tection de plongeurs n'est pas l'objectif premier de l'&eacute;tude. Cette utilisation n'est qu'un exemple. Cependant, le consultant peut le proposer.</p>
<p>2. (ANNEX 1, 1-10 (page), 1.3 THE NEED FOR SECURITY AND SURVEILLENCE SYSTEM): The threat serves as the baseline for the commencement of any assessment. Is it the customer's intent to provide the Security Subject Matter Expert (SME) access to intelligence and law enforcement agencies to gain insight into the current and anticipated threat?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : Le but de l'ANP pour la r&eacute;alisation du Projet VTS aux ports de Casablanca et Safi est strictement r&eacute;serv&eacute; au trafic portuaire et aux navires entrant et sortant.</p>
<p>3. (ANNEX 1, 1-11 (page), 2.3 PORT SECURITY AND SURVEILLENCE SYSTEM): Is it the customers intent or desire to have a standalone Port Security and Surveillance System. Would it be acceptable to integrate both capabilities, i.e., Security and VTMS, into a single system?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : La r&eacute;ponse &agrave; cette question est oui.</p>
<p>4. (ANNEX 1, 1-12 (page), 2.3 (10) PORT SECURITY AND SURVEILLENCE SYSTEM): It is imperative to understand the specific responsibilities, jurisdictions, and affiliations of all departments and agencies working to prevent and/or respond to a safety/security event. Will the Security SME be allowed to interview members of these departments and agencies as well as review their Standard Operating Procedures, e.g., command &amp; control; communication; intelligence fusion; tactics, techniques, and procedures, etc.?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : S&eacute;curit&eacute; et s&ucirc;ret&eacute; pour une Autorit&eacute; portuaire telle que l'ANP sont comprises dans le cadre de l'application du Code ISPS strictement.</p>
<p>5. (ANNEX 4, Grant Agreement Btwn USTDA and ANP, page 8 (item 20)): To provide an effect final feasibility study regarding Safety and Security, recommendations will potentially involve specific technologies and/or methodologies that may have International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) implications. Does the customer foresee ITAR as being a potential issue?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : La r&eacute;ponse &agrave; la question 5 ne rel&egrave;ve pas des attributions de l'ANP.</p>
<p>6. (ANNEX I, I-1 (page), Site Survey): Is it the customer's intent for the Feasibility Study Team to spend 1.5 weeks in each of the two locations, i.e., is there a requirement for the team to spend a total of three weeks on-site regardless of the progress associated with the effort?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : La dur&eacute;e du s&eacute;jour est fonction du premier contact sur le terrain. Il nous semble qu'une semaine et demi est raisonnable.</p>
<p>7. (ANNEX I, I-3 (page), Task 5): Is it the customer's intent to install a completely new system(s)? Other than supporting infrastructure, e.g., power sources, facilities, etc., are there other capabilities that will need to be integrated into the new system(s), e.g., existing radar, cameras, monitoring systems, etc.?</p>
<p>R&eacute;ponse : Au port de Safi, il est n&eacute;cessaire d'installer un syst&egrave;me totalement neuf. Dans ce port, les infrastructures (locaux) et l'alimentation sont disponibles<br />Au port de Casablanca, le VTS existe. Il faut le moderniser pour int&eacute;grer d'autres fonctions.<br />Dans les deux ports, il est n&eacute;cessaire que le syst&egrave;me VTS int&egrave;gre l'interfa&ccedil;age avec le syst&egrave;me AS 400 en cours dans ses deux ports pour le mouvement des navires.<br />Au port de Casablanca, il doit int&eacute;grer les cam&eacute;ras de surveillance et le syst&egrave;me d'archivage.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COATESVILLE MEDICAL CENTER SCOPE OF WORK ENGINEERING EVALUATION OF BOILER RELIABILITY/LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR BOILERS 1,2,3,4  1.  Introduction:  VA medical centers provide critical health care which requires reliable steam supply for sterilization, domestic hot water, kitchens, and building heating/air conditioning.  Boilers serving VA medical centers must be reliable, safe and efficient.  The age of boilers is often a major indicator of reliability.  The VHA Directive 2003-050, BOILER PLANT OPERATIONS, assigns useful life expectancy, in years, to the boiler plant equipment.  The Directive requires that retention of equipment beyond the useful life expectancy must be based on an engineering evaluation of the reliability, efficiency and cost effectiveness of continued operation.  Following are boilers to be included in evaluation  #1 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14579-1 #2 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14579-2 #3 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 40,000#/hr, serial # 14580-2 #4 - D-type E. Keeler Company mfg. 1968, 20,000#/hr, serial # 14580-1   2.  Summary of Requirements:  When boilers reach the end of their expected lives, VAMC engineering personnel should review the condition of the boilers as reflected in the operational records, maintenance and repair history and in the reports of the annual boiler inspections.  If there is no clear indication on whether the boilers should be retained or replaced, an engineering evaluation of life expectancy should be commissioned.  A professional engineering firm that specializes in life expectancy evaluations should be contracted to evaluate the boiler by means of visual inspection and non-destructive testing utilizing experienced boiler inspectors and non-destructive testing experts.  Their report must describe all conditions found and include sufficient information that VAMC engineers can make decisions on retaining or replacing the boilers.  3.  Qualification Requirements for Inspection Personnel:  A.	The inspections shall be supervised on-site by a Qualified Professional Inspector,  defined as any one or combination of:  1)	A boiler inspector who has a valid commission from the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.  2)	A boiler inspector who has qualified by passing a written examination under the laws, rules and regulations of a jurisdiction of a state.  3)	A boiler inspector who is regularly employed as a boiler inspector by a jurisdiction that has adopted and administers one or more sections of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code as a legal requirement, and has a representative serving as a member of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Conference Committee.  4)	A boiler inspector who is regularly employed by an insurance company that has been licensed or registered by the appropriate authority of a state of the United States to write boiler and pressure vessel insurance.  B.	Non-destructive testing personnel shall be certified to American Society for Non-destructive Testing (ASNT) Level II, who are experienced in evaluating boilers.  4.  VAMC Responsibilities for Preparation of Boiler for Inspection:  A.	All preparation work shall be done prior to arrival of inspection personnel.  B.	Coordinate preparation work with the requirements of the inspection firm.  C.	Records of maintenance and repair activities, water treatment logs, operational logs, inspection reports, and histories of prior problems shall be readily available during the inspection.  Records for three years are suggested.  D.	Remove all manway and handhole covers, access panels.  E.	Remove all drum internals.  F.	Furnish copies of the original National Board (NB) Manufacturers Data Report inspection form that was prepared for the boiler when it was new and NB Report of Repair forms if boiler pressure vessel repairs have been performed.  5.	Inspection Requirements:  Contractor shall arrange for personal protective equipment and safety personnel for any OSHA requirements to include confined spaces.   A.	Visually inspect:  1)	All welded and threaded pipe connections to the boiler shell or drum for signs of leakage or defects in the welded areas.  Defects should be non-destructively tested.  2)	Boiler support structure for proper alignment, evidence of sagging, shifting or misalignment.  3)	Boiler casings for signs of warping, misalignment and overheating.  4)	All furnace tubes and all accessible convection tubes for alignment, evidence of corrosion, erosion, bulges, sagging, defective or deteriorated welds.  5)	Exposed surfaces of steam and mud drum in furnace, particularly ligament areas between tubes, for evidence of corrosion, cracking, scale buildup, other defects.  6)	Refractory for cracking, shifting, sagging, bulging or general deterioration.  7)	Internal areas of steam drum and mud drum (inside boiler shell in fire tube boilers).  a.	Welded outlet connections.  b.	Surface of drums for pitting or surface discontinuities.  c.	Ligament areas between tube holes for cracking.  d.	Each tube end and internal surface of representative number of tubes for pitting, erosion, corrosion and excessive scale buildup.  Utilize fiber optic inspection equipment to inspect interior of tubes.  e.	Clean and inspect shell or tube sheet between tube holes for cracking.  B.  Non-destructive testing:  1)	Ultrasonic thickness testing of representative samples of all components. Note:  A specific number of tests at various areas should be specified.  2)	Ultrasonic thickness testing of all areas visually noted to have corroded or eroded.  3)	Magnetic particle testing of all areas where indications of defects have been found visually.  4)	Metallurgical analysis of representative samples of boiler metal if there are indications or a record of overheating.  C.	Calculation of maximum allowable working pressure and remaining life expectancy:  1)	Utilize ASME Code formula.  2)	Remaining life calculation based on original material thickness, current material thickness, evaluation of other factors in the condition of the boiler.  3)	Obtain sufficient material thickness measurements to accurately reflect the condition of the entire boiler. This shall include removal and reinstallation of casing  and insulation as necessary to inspect lower D-tubes near mud drum.  6.  Report Requirements:  A.	Provide oral report of condition of the boiler to VAMC engineering management at the conclusion of the inspection.  B.	Provide six hard copies and electronic version of report.  1)	Provide complete narrative, test results, photographic views of deteriorated areas.  2)	Calculate remaining life based on calculated present maximum allowable working pressure vs. original maximum allowable working pressure when the boiler was new.  3)	Describe all deteriorated areas; provide expert judgment on need for repairs, repair methods and cost estimates.  4)	Provide expert judgment on cost effectiveness of retaining the boiler in service.

<DESC>The Indian Health Service, has issued a modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to add funding to contract number FB0757003T3.    A description of the contract is listed in this synopsis.  This core task was fully competed among GSA Schedule 70 holders.  This modification/ARRA task is technically identical to the tasks performed as part of the core task. Uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.  As such, a Time and Materials type action was awarded. (FAR 16.601).  The ARRA funded Modification work will be issued under FB7507003R.

<DESC>RECOVERY. The intent and purpose of this work is to clear radial drains and allow for unrestricted flow of seepage water that is collected by the Seepage Adits.  The Contractor shall provide all plans, labor, materials, shop facilities, supervision, tools, staging, scaffolding and any other items necessary for hydraulic/mechanical clearing of drains in the Adits.  Contractor shall identify and utilize all necessary power, lighting, safety requirements, etc., from the existing power sources at the facility.  Depths of drains vary from 20 to 200 feet.  Drains are installed in 3-inch diameter core holes drilled into interlayered mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate and are lined with 1.5-inch ID, Schedule 80 PVC pipe.  During construction, water-bearing zones were identified in the core holes and perforated PVC pipe sections were located accordingly.  Solid PVC pipe sections have butyl packers attached to secure the entire assembly within the core hole.  Generally speaking, drains are oriented from 9 degrees - 34 degrees down from horizontal and from   56 degrees  82 degrees up from the horizontal.  The North and South Adits can be accessed by way of paved and semi-improved dirt roads.  Access to the Adits will be provided by the Government.  Adits are 10 feet high and 9 feet wide.  Figure 2 shows a typical section that illustrates the Adits with the radial drain layout.<BR><BR>Contract duration is 180 calendar days.  NAICS Code 561790 with a size standard of $7 Million.
