Offerors must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database (available at: www.ccr.gov) per FAR 52.212-1.

<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>

Vision 2020 is an industry created strategic plan and roadmap; documents were developed over a several year period which began in 2003.  The contractor will participate in the discussions with ACI Foundation's Strategic Development Council (SDC) and will capture their recommendations for future phases in the final report for this project.  
A previous Sources Sought Notice was posted under R10PS80497A.  Based upon the response to the Sources Sought, this acquisition will be set-aside for small business.

The relative order of all evaluation factors is (1) Technical Capability (2) Past Performance, (3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined will be significantly more important than price.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Payette National Forest, intends to acquire by contract the following services:  Brundage VMP Stewardship.  Description of Work  The Brundage VMP Stewardship Project is located on the McCall Ranger District of the Payette National Forest encompassing the area indicated on the Contract Area Maps (which includes Timber Removal Map) to the northwest of McCall.  Several different treatments are prescribed for the Brundage WUI Fuels Reduction project.  Approximately 6727 Tons (2550 CCF) of timber will be removed from 221 acres.  Harvest systems include tractor/jammer logging on 188 acres and Off Road Jammer 33 acres.  Tractor skidding would occur on slopes of less than 45 percent and would require designated skid trails.  Jammer skidding in units inaccessible to tractor skidding would occur from existing roads, temporary roads, and constructed skid trails where the skidding distance is less than 300 feet and generally greater than 45 percent slope.  

Approximately a  mile of temporary road would be constructed to access the project area, and when use is completed obliterated.  Fifteen miles of existing road will be reconstructed and approximately one mile of road within 200 feet of streams would be graveled.

All resulting slash not needed for Coarse Woody Debris and rehabbing skid trails will be chipped and removed from site. 

Project Location  The project is located on the McCall Ranger District and is within the Brundage Mountain Ski Area (approximately 5 miles northwest of McCall).  The legal description for the project is T18N, R3E, Section 31; T19N, R2E, Sections 1, 12, 13, 24,  and 25; and T19N, R3E, Sections 6, 7, 18, 19, 30, and 31.  Boise Meridian, Adams County Idaho. 

The Forest Service intends to issue a solicitation for this project utilizing FAR Part 12 procedures for commercial contracting and FAR Part 15 for contracting by negotiation. This acquisition is available for full and open competition amongst all responsible offerors.  A single firm-fixed price type contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror (IAW FAR Part 9, Contractor Qualifications) whose offer is of the best value based upon the evaluation factors provided in the solicitation.

Resulting Contract  Any resultant contract will be a Construction contract with provisions for timber removal.  This solicitation will be available on or about March 22, 2010. The period of performance for this project is (approx) 3 years from the date of contract award, which is anticipated to be on or about May 15, 2010.  It is anticipated that work will begin on this effort on or about 15 June 2010.

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the bidder will render a bidder ineligible for award. Bidders may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.

<CONTACT>Debora Ann Pitts, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-3789, Fax 301-443-6038, Email dpitts@hrsa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) anticipates soliciting services for the Business Case got Breastfeeding: Outreach to Employers and Labor Organizations for the . Maternal Child Health Bureau (MCHB), HRSA. .The proposed acquisition listed herein is a 100% small business set aside. Breastfeeding imparts numerous health benefits for both infants and their mothers as documented in research. The health outcomes are so significant that in the U.S., it has been estimated that more than $13 billion can be saved in the nation's health care costs if most mothers exclusively breastfeed their infants to 6 months as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and nearly all major health professional and medical organizations world-wide. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Survey show that nearly 75% of women initiate breastfeeding following their infant's birth. However, only 33% are breastfeeding exclusively by 3 months postpartum, and less than 14% exclusively breastfeed for the recommended 6 month period. Returning to work is among the reasons cited for early supplementation and/or total weaning to formula. Current data indicate that in the United States, more than 70% of the nation's women are employed. Over half of the mothers with small children are either seeking or returning to full-time employment shortly after the birth of their infant. For breastfeeding mothers employed outside of the home, maintaining milk production while separated from their infant remains a significant challenge. According to a national survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management in 2008, only 25% of businesses offer a lactation room for mothers to express milk, and only 6% offer education and access to lactation support. Section 4207 of the recently passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (health care reform bill) calls for amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requiring employers to provide "reasonable break time for an employee to express milk for her nursing child for 1 year after the child's birth each time such employee has need to express milk, and a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express milk." In 2007, HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) with support from DHHS Office on Women's Health (OWH) developed and marketed The Business Case for Breastfeeding, a worksite initiative designed to increase awareness of the importance of lactation support in the workplace. This worksite initiative has provided employers with both the business rationale and effective options for supporting their breastfeeding employees.<br />Over the past three years, MCHB and OWH provided training to State breastfeeding coalition members in thirty States to utilize The Business Case for Breastfeeding in assisting small and medium-sized businesses establish appropriate lactation support for their breastfeeding employees. Based on this training, State breastfeeding coalition members have provided outreach to more than 1000 businesses throughout the U.S. In addition, The Business Case for Breastfeeding has been adapted by the National Business Group on Health for use by large companies with more than 50 employees. This worksite initiative is timely and necessary in light of the provisions of the recently passed health reform bill. Year four implementation of The Business Case for Breastfeeding will broaden the outreach efforts to conduct national-level training that will assist businesses in providing the necessary support for their breastfeeding employees. The outreach and training will also assist employers in the implementation of the new lactation support requirement in health care reform legislation.<br />This initiative builds on current efforts and seeks to advance breastfeeding worksite support as part of mainstream national policy and practice. A national outreach and collaboration effort will be implemented, involving some or all of the following tasks: (a) Conduct outreach to at least ten business organizations and labor unions with a national membership or reach. Methods include site visits to stakeholders, monthly phone calls and emails to provide an-going assistance; and presentations at five (5) conferences, which will be based on HRSA's resource kit The Business Case for Breastfeeding: Steps to Creating a Breastfeeding Friendly Worksite. (b) Convene a small scale National Summit in Washington, D.C. to identify strategies for comprehensive implementation of The Business Case for Breastfeeding (C)Develop a Toolkit with recommendations for implementing breastfeeding support programs in specific worksites such as universities and colleges, schools and hospitals which present specific challenges, (D) Present three (3) one-day training events based on The Business Case for Breastfeeding for U.S. Government Work-Life Coordinators in collaboration with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. (E) Develop three (3) one hour webinars based on the Business Case for Breastfeeding for use by businesses with national scope and national organizations representing businesses and (F) Sponsor monthly conference calls with State Breastfeeding Coalitions to discuss their outreach activities with businesses in their states. The anticipated period of performance is for an eighteen (18) month base year. This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) may be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov approximately fifteen (15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations- Office of Acquisition Management Policy, Division of Contracting Operations.

<DESC>Recovery - This acquisition is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.

Background:  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Contractor support for its Health Information Technology (IT) Standards and Test Methods Project.  The objective of the project is to focus resources on specific, national priority standards and testing needs in the healthcare community to further clinical information exchange among providers, consumers, public health and other stakeholders.  This project does not seek to select the standards that should be used by the healthcare community; it seeks to analyze those standards deemed appropriate by the healthcare community by objectively determining the maturity, robustness, testability and suitability of a particular standard for use (i.e., is it free from ambiguities, errors, inconsistencies, omissions, and to the extent possible, meets intended requirements).  Additionally, this project seeks to develop appropriate test material, data and standard-specific test tools for high priority national need standards and interoperability.

Scope of this Acquisition:  This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition in the area of Health Level (HL) 7 V3 Clinical Care Document (CCD) Definition.  NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000).  The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year.  The Government intends to utilize the labor-hour contract type for these services because it is not possible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.

<SUBJECT>Develop Recruitment Strategy and Recruit Participants for a CAT Tool Study associated with SSA's Disability Evaluation Process
<SOLNBR>NIHCL2010069
<RESPDATE>082510
<CONTACT>Ann G Argaman, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov
<DESC>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) in Bethesda, Maryland has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process. This requires assessment of individuals' abilities across a variety of functional domains while considering functional workplace demands and environmental features of workplace, home, and community settings. Current efforts to develop assessments of human functioning using computer adaptive testing (CAT) tools founded upon item response theory (IRT) are underway. The use of CAT tools could potentially allow the SSA to collect more relevant and precise data, in a faster, more efficient fashion. Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.
<p>To meet objectives associated with the NIH-RMD collaboration with the SSA, CAT tool development will require a calibration study for each instrument. A calibration study is a field study of item content and structure conducted with samples of respondents representing the intended users of the CAT instruments. Item pool development and subsequent item calibration are unique for each CAT tool and for the target population for which they are developed. To better support the SSA's evaluation process, distinct applicant and provider CAT instruments are being developed. Participant recruitment and telephone as well as internet test administration will be needed to conduct the CAT tool calibration studies.</p>
<p>The NIH-RMD seeks a contractor who will develop a detailed recruitment plan and implement a participant recruitment effort to achieve projected sample sizes for the calibration studies. The recruitment plan must seamlessly integrate with existing work conducted by Boston University to develop CAT tools under contract number HHSN26920090004C. For the purposes of CAT calibration, it will be necessary to collect information from both providers and claimants about the functional abilities of claimants relative to workplace demands. It is recommended pairs (or dyads) of claimants and providers be recruited for the CAT calibration studies. Sample sizes for most scientifically defensible CAT calibration projects are in the range of 500-700 respondents. This sample size is needed to support a series of confirmatory factor analyses and to perform statistical modeling. Inadequate sample size may lead to inaccurate and unstable statistical outcomes. Due to projected response rates for the recruitment of claimants and providers, the anticipated recruitment volume will require the contractor provide evidence of established procedures and staffing to efficiently manage the recruitment effort. The contractor must demonstrate expertise in CAT tool development and the application of CAT technology for the purposes of disability assessment. The contractor should demonstrate prior success in the completion of calibration studies associated with CAT tool development in domains of human functioning. In order to optimize the contractor's ability to complete this requirement in the established timeframe, current SSA clearances are required.</p>
<p>RFP NIHCL2010069 for this requirement will be posted on the FEDBIZ Opps site. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading a copy and for monitoring any amenndments or changes made to this RFP.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The Endocrinology, Nutrition, and Growth Branch , within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253  (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with Clinical Trials and Surveys Corporation (C-TASC), Baltimore, Maryland, entitled, Bone Mineral Density in Childhood study  Data Coordinating Center.   A 12 month extension is necessary, in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operations of the data coordinating center.  This modification will allow C-TASC to continue uninterrupted services to complete the close-out and finalization of all data, and to assist with the analysis of the data.  The data coordinating center is creating a website to be used by the scientific community to enable them to use our reference data to calculate bone mineral density Z scores.
This modification is to continue services until September 30, 2011.  The Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) includes five Clinical Centers all adhering to a common longitudinal observational protocol of six years duration. The objective of the clinical site contracts has been to collect and distribute, to the scientific community, standard reference data for bone mineral density in childhood, taking into consideration skeletal maturation, bone size and volume, and pubertal stage. The collection phase of the study at the clinical sites is now complete and the data coordinating center, C-TASC, is in charge of the coordination of the current projects involving data dissemination and analysis. This data will serve as a gold-standard pediatric BMD database and will be a valuable resource for both clinicians and investigators in this field who require this information for assessing bone deficits and risk factors for impaired bone health in children. 
In order to perform the continued work, it is necessary to have a complete understanding of the past implementation of the protocol to now assist with requests for data analysis.

Appointments shall be made using DoD approved standard appointment types, MTF business rules, and appointment detail codes as detailed in the MHS Guide to Access Success for appointments booked in the Composite Health Care System (CHCS)/Enterprise Wide Scheduling-Registration (EWS-R).  Appointments may also be booked in VISTA.
THE DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SYNOPSIS REFLECTS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AS OF THIS PRINTING.  THESE FACTS MAY BE UPDATED OR REVISED IN THE ACTUAL REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, WHEN ISSUED.  
The purpose of this requirement is to obtain non personal Patient Appointing Services (PAS) in support of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) that will significantly enhance appointing procedures and improve service to its customers.   This requirement augments the capability of the MTF staff to book health care appointments in the direct care system at MTFs for Military Health System (MHS) eligible beneficiaries.  This service includes verifying registration information in the appointment system, correcting and, when required, registering beneficiaries prior to making the appointment, making and canceling of patient appointments, and providing performance and management reports on the appointing process for MHS eligible beneficiaries.  The Contractor shall make urgent appointments with non-MTF (network and/or non-network) providers.  The Contractor shall be trained to recognize those non-eligible beneficiaries who qualify for an appointment.  Centralized appointing services are required in support of daily operations at CAPTAIN James A Lovell  Federal Health Care Center (Hereafter referred to as FHCC)   Appointing at the MTF has been accomplished by the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) staff and contractor support since 1998. The Contractor shall appoint Tuesday through Thursday, 0730 to 1630 closed weekends and Federal holidays, with the busiest hours between 0800 to 1000 and 1500 to 1600.  Additionally, out-going wellness promotional and appointment calls between the hours of 1700 - 1900 Tuesday through Thursday will be accomplished, however the in-coming call line for other appointments is turned off at 1630 daily.  Clinic hours are from 0730- 1600.  MTF's outpatient clinic and appointment services are closed on federal holidays.  The work day and holiday schedule for the contractor should mirror the Federal holiday schedule.  Beneficiaries have access to scheduling appointments through the lunch hour. During those hours when the appointing function is not available, the Contractor's telephone system shall have a recording informing the patients of the clinic hours and to call 911 if they are experiencing a medical emergency. The current call volume is an average of approximately 50,000 available appointment transactions at the MTF each year. The beneficiary population consists of 21,000 Prime enrollees, 20,000 non-Prime enrollees, and 24,000 recruits and students who are not enrolled to the MTF.
It is anticipated that the contractor personnel will work in office space provided by the Government at the FHCC.  It is also possible that initial performance would be at the current Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes before transferring to the FHCC.  In addition to the above, the contractor may be required to provide Telephony services which would require that he supply the telephone equipment by lease or otherwise.  This will be specified in the RFQ, if necessary.
It is intended that this procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR 13.5  Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and FAR Part 12 will apply.  It is anticipated that a firm fixed price service contract will result from this solicitation.  It is anticipated that the basic performance period will be 01 October 2010 thru 30 September 2011.  It is further anticipated that an additional four (4) twelve-month option periods will be included for a total maximum of sixty (60) months of service if all options are exercised.  In addition, the resultant contract may include the clause FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, which could extend the services an additional six months past the final option period for a total maximum of 66 months.
This is a 100% small business set-aside.  All eligible small businesses are encouraged to submit quotes in response to the RFQ for consideration of the Government.

<DESC><p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) seeks proposals as provided under the<br />authority set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection 2192 (b) of title 10 in support of<br />education programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The ONR mission of STEM is to: foster an interest in, knowledge of, and study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics nationwide to ensure an educated and well-prepared workforce, which meets the naval and national competitive needs. In support of this mission, the following five goals have been identified:<br />Inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. [Grades K-10]<br />Engage students in STEM-related hands-on learning activities using Navy content. [Grades 3-12]<br />Educate students to be well-prepared for employment in STEM disciplines in the Navy or in supporting academic institutions or the Naval contractor community. [Higher Education]<br />Employ, retain and develop Naval STEM professionals. [Higher Education, Professional Development, Faculty]<br />Collaborate across Naval STEM programs to maximize benefits to participants and the Navy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to receive proposals in support of the Office of Naval Research's mission of scientific outreach and education in working to develop the next generation of scientists capable of providing support to the continued development of critical technologies in support of the Department of Defense. The objective of these activities will be to:</p>
<p>1. Establish and ensure successful, sustainable, and affordable long-term Navy wide programs targeted at elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher learning.<br />2. Establish and maintain a pipeline of students, particularly women and members of minority groups, who will apply for and participate in Navy education and outreach programs. <br />3.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The development of vaccines to prevent the spread of HIV infection is among the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) highest priorities. In addition, vaccines administered to infected individuals have potential for inducing immune control of the infectious agent. While advances in immunology and molecular biology continue to offer an expanding array of approaches for the development of new vaccines/products, there is limited capacity to move promising concepts through the development process. In order to supplement limited industry involvement in developing vaccines, NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive and developmentally-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies. NIAID will use this contract to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to one organization that meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise will be issued after the award of the base contract.</p>
<p>This is a recompetition of an existing contract entitled "Master Contract for Preclinical Development" with Advanced BioScience Laboratory, Inc., under contract number N01-AI-40045.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The Contractor shall provide preclinical development support for promising candidates when such candidates emerge from investigator-initiated research studies. These capabilities will allow NIAID to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps. The Contractor shall assist NIAID staff in providing all support needed for small-scale production, preclinical testing and documentation leading to Investigational New Drug (IND) submission for Phase I, II, and III clinical testing.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The Contractor will manage a preclinical research program that shall provide NIAID with a broad and flexible range of nontraditional, proactive and developmentally-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies. The Contractor will assist in identification, testing, and development of products; participate in and manage preclinical testing including in vitro laboratory testing, immunogenicity testing, efficacy studies, and toxicology testing using laboratory animals; and utilize GMP production protocols to produce products. Furthermore, the Contractor will also maintain inventories of products, provide quality assurance and quality control, provide the appropriate regulatory documentation, and develop and manage a database that tracks the preclinical development of the products.</p>
<p>The Contractor will carry out, either directly or through subcontractors and/or consultants, tasks in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Essential Core Activities: This task area includes essential activities that shall be performed by the Contractor on a regular basis and consists of the following:</p>
<p>a. Project Management<br />b. Quality Assurance/Quality Control<br />c. Information Technology and Data Management<br />d. Storage and Shipping<br />e. Reporting Requirements/Deliverables<br />f. Transition</p>
<p>2. Feasibility Assessments: Under this task area, the Contractor shall assess products for feasibility of design, development, manufacture, potency assay development and stability for the development of phase I-III clinical trial materials.</p>
<p>3. Audits: Under this task area the Contractor shall conduct, review and evaluate audits. Types of audits to be conducted include, but are not limited to, technical and/or facilities audits.</p>
<p>4. Regulatory Documentation: Under this task area, for products produced and/or tested for use in NIAID-sponsored research, in collaboration with the product supplier, the Contractor shall develop a Master File, Investigator's Brochure, and compile an IND application, including a clinical trial protocol (provided by NIAID) appropriate for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [Guidance on regulatory requirements can be obtained through the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research website (www.fda.gov/cber).]</p>
<p>5. Process Development and cGMP Manufacture: Under this task area the Contractor shall produce vaccines and research-grade products as requested by the COTR, including process development and production of cGMP pilot lots suitable for early phase human clinical trials, and perform the necessary characterization tests required for release for clinical use.</p>
<p>6. Safety and Immunogenicity Testing: Under this task area the Contractor shall perform pre-clinical testing of products as required for regulatory compliance prior to initial human clinical trial evaluation.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The anticipated period of performance is for seven years beginning August 29, 2011 through August 28, 2018.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08032010
<CONTACT>Charee K. Harris

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK/DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
 
1.1 CONTINUED SUPPORT: Critical Care (ICU, OR, and PAUC), Clinical Data Stores, and Healthcare Analytics System. 

A hospital, building a data warehouse comprised of data from its clinical systems, should expect to be able to answer questions addressing clinical quality, medical error reduction, healthcare costs, and differentiating quality, as well as a wide range of clinical research endeavors.  However, commercially available healthcare data warehousing activities relate primarily to (1) the storage and preservation of data, and (2) providing answers to known questions, either through standard reports or structured ad hoc queries.  These systems are insufficient for analyzing clinical information outside of highly structured and limited domains.  In analyzing clinical data, new knowledge is most often discovered by finding new questions, adding new data elements without first modifying the model, and working freely across domains limited only by the availability of data.   An effective healthcare analytics solution will then allow physician and other clinicians to leverage the value of clinical data stores to decrease medical errors, and improve the quality of veteran health care.
The Healthcare Analytics Solution is a powerful analytical environment which provides healthcare professionals with the ability to directly access clinical data stores, thus enabling improved patient care, a reduction in medical errors, and the conduct of a broad range of research initiatives.  To accomplish these goals, the Healthcare Analytics Solution allows clinical users to directly query data generated by diverse systems.  The Healthcare Analytics Solution supports rapid, iterative analysis of clinical data by domain knowledgeable people through an intuitive user interface including the analysis of temporal relationships.  New queries or algorithms can be deployed without first requiring support from information technology experts.
The Healthcare Analytics Solution is a secure web application that provides a graphical user interface to the desktop of approved users.  From their browser based interface, the user then queries Healthcare Analytics Solution analytic data stores created from a variety of sources. Users may then select data across tables (for example systolic blood pressure, serum potassium, surgical procedure, operating time, and mortality) and then form an analytical query.  The Healthcare Analytics Solution provides the ability to create an analytic table, run an analysis, evaluate the results and then iteratively make adjustments both to the analytical tables and algorithms on the fly. 
The goal of the Healthcare Analytics Solution is to provide clinicians with a tool that will help them improve the quality of care delivered to veterans.
The following bullets highlight the general work flow a user would follow:
"	Identify a collection of clinical data that is of interest.  The user can add new data elements without having to first modify the model, and may work freely across domains limited only by the availability of data.    
"	Create a general or specific query against the identified clinical data.
"	Analyze data sequentially (work across rows) and perform time series analysis to answer clinical questions.   
"	Aggregate the table, and create summary statistics.
"	Examine and evaluate the results of the query.
"	Modify and re-run the query.
"	Graph results or export to a statistical analysis package.

"	Upgrades of the analytic interrogation engine and analytic data stores
"	Upgrades to the browser based graphical user interface
"	Upgrade system event/query library
 1.7 User Administration
VISN 21 may administer user privileges and access to the database from the analytics GUI.  A VISN 21 analytics administrator may add new users to the system.  The VISN 21 administrator can then assign the user a level of access to the analytic features, and specify which data a user may access.  The analytics administrator can create a user group and then specify the data to which that group has access.  The analytics administrator may then assign users to one or more groups.  The analytics administrator will also manage the private sharing of query parameters and other sharable work.

  1.8 Security
Co-located in a VISN 21 data center, the analytics server will be protected by the same level of physical security as any VISN 21 server. The server will reside on the VHA network and within the VA firewall conforming to all VA network security requirements. Solution Analytics will ensure browser access is through "https" and that each user is assigned a username and password conforming to VHA requirements. Solution Analytics will also ensure that the Healthcare Analytics Platform, working through database security features such as fine grain access control, allows the VISN 21 administrator to define user access to data at the level of hospital, row, column, and table. 
2.0 CIS Server database maintenance support.
This service includes on-going support and maintenance of:
"	OR/ICU Critical care PICIS servers (most server issues can be handled remotely by our DBA / server administrator in Palo Alto, but physical administration of hospital servers other than Palo Alto would be accomplished by on-site VISN 21 IT personnel under the guidance of our DBA/server administrator)
"	Operating Room (OR) PICIS servers, including conscious sedation data (once fully implemented and in production mode)
"	Central VISN server
"	One way replication of the Palo Alto PICIS database to the other VISN hospitals
"	PICIS and VistA extracts to the analytics server, including OR and conscious sedation data.
"	On-going support to automate new standard tables and other database customization for VISN 21 custom reports and populations, including OR and conscious sedation data.
"	Staging, and load of new types of data to be exported from VistA, as well as the management of the new VistA extracts.
"	Re-staging of data related to the new extract data software.
"	On-site experienced Oracle DBA / system administrator at 0.4 FTE

3.0 Custom analytics provider and QI reports training.
This section addresses additional training of VISN 21 personnel in the use of the analytic environment to create and maintain quality improvement/resource utilization reports, as well as the creation of custom provider reports, and custom enhancements to the user interface.
Custom user inter-face enhancements: 
This service includes implementation and customization of GUI based access to data from the ICU, operating room, PACU, and conscious sedation areas with respect to: 
"	Information regarding the data available for analysis
"	Analysis "wizards" to facilitate table, query and result creation, and 
"	Field analysis and manipulation tools, including conversion of dates (date stored as number <=> date, date=>month, year, dow, hour), numbers stored as strings to numeric storage, and continuous numeric values to categorical with user controlled "bin" limits
Custom reports: 
This service includes support for the implementation and customization of VISN 21 reports.  This will include the customization of at least four report templates that allow reports to be generated on multiple levels - VISN to provider.  At least four individual reports will be created using the templates oriented to important clinical areas or clinical issues.  The VISN will be responsible for selecting the four areas of focus for this activity, and providing a prioritized list of initial measures for each selected area.  The reports will include features that allow for the user to "drill down," access additional data, and analytic features.   Documentation for the use of these templates will be provided.

In addition, this will in addition include both the production of new quality improvement, department director, and provider report templates and related populations as well as the adaptation / modification of templates and tables created for intensive care data.  The methodology associated with the "bundle" report templates and tables produced to support VISN 21's participation in the VA IPEC program best illustrates this service.  An initial effort produced report templates for the ICU "bundle" program, and supported VISN21 in their implementation and use.  VISN 21 staff now independently use the bundle reports to monitor bundle implementation, performance, and clinical outcomes.  This model has effectively been extended to reports supporting quality improvement efforts to prevent skin breakdown (Braden and wound reports), and decreasing the unnecessary use of indwelling foley catheters.

Custom Analytics activities will also include support for VA Data standardization initiatives and
basic user support.
4.0 Extension of the analytics license and the addition of OR data.
This service includes extension of the analytic license to all VISN 21 patient related data including OR clinical information system, as well as comparative analysis to other VA data from outside the VISN or to any other benchmark data.

Install/monitor the production servers in each facility: Palo Alto; Northern Cal; San Francisco; Reno; and Fresno (other sites in VISN 21 may be added in the future).  Install standby servers at the Palo Alto facility. Work with the Analytics DBA to configure the Oracle failover system using Oracle Data Guard.  This includes both system initiation and testing to ensure the failover system is working properly. Work with the Analytics DBA and facility clinical and technical point of contacts (POCs) to coordinate and perform database shutdown activities during maintenance activities. Configure backup software, perform routine system backups, and test recovery procedures. Install security patches and anti-virus applications. Participate in system integration testing at each site. Other services as required to support the PICIS system.  
 
6.0  PICIS CLIENT WORKSTATION SUPPORT: The contractor shall work with Veteran Affairs (VA) personnel to perform the following services against the PICIS client workstations. As this support requires familiarization with PICIS and medical monitoring equipment, in addition to system administration expertise.VA personnel will train the contractor on PICIS and medical monitoring equipment specifics.

Personnel Identity Verification (PIV) of Contractor Personnel

In accordance with FAR 52.204-9 and VA Directive 0735 - Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, any contract person who requires routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system will be required to verify their identity prior to providing services under the contract.  Prior to providing services under the contract, each contract person will be asked to provide up to two (2) forms of identification from the Accepted Identification Documentation List to the appropriate VA representative in order to obtain a proper VA-issued identification card.  See the Accepted Identification Documentation List provided below.  The COTR, or designee, will be responsible for sponsoring each contract person that requires a VA-issued identification card.





PIV ID Proofing Criteria

The following criteria must be met by all VA employees, contractors, and affiliates prior to being issued a PIV card or Temporary Identity Badge.

Table of Accepted Identification (From Form I-9)
Last Update: June 5, 2006
 

1. Two forms of identification are required from the list of acceptable documents.  At least one ID must be a state or federal government issued picture ID.  Either of the following is accepted:

a. Two forms of identification from the left column (Federal or State Government issued picture ID).

b. One form of identification from the left column (Federal or State Government issued picture ID) and one form from the right column (NonPicture ID or Acceptable Picture ID not issued by Federal or State Government).

2. Any form of identification used for ID proofing may not be expired.

3. Hand written or photocopied documents are not accepted.

4. An ID issued before a legal name change (e.g. birth certificate or driver's license) can be presented as one form of ID if a legal document (e.g. marriage certificate/license or a court order) is also presented linking the previous name to the current legal name. The linking document has to display both the former and current legal names. Both documents must be valid and not expired. For example, a married woman may use both a certified copy of her birth certificate and marriage license as one form of ID as long as the marriage license has to display both her maiden name and married name.

5. The Applicant's name listed on the VA Form 0711, Request for One-VA Identification Card, must match the name on one of the IDs presented by the Applicant.

<DESC>                                                   REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In accordance with the Postal Services Supplying Principles and Practices, the Postal Service is issuing a request for information (RFI) as a sources sought notice.  This is an invitation for potential suppliers to register interest in providing air transportation and supporting services.  It is the intent of the Postal Service to award air transportation and its ancillary services (ground handling/terminal handling and scanning) to pre-qualified, high performing air transportation suppliers, at reasonable prices, that are willing to meet postal operating and business criteria as listed in this document.  A key operating goal is to have sufficient network redundancy. 

Potential suppliers are asked to submit responses that provide information about their companies demonstrating how they will meet or exceed our provided requirements.  This process identifies what is in the marketplace and provides an opportunity leading to pre-qualification of potential suppliers.  Unlike a request for proposals (RFP), an RFI does not imply a commitment to acquire the services identified in the RFI from any responding supplier.  An RFI provides the Postal Service with useful information to further assess innovative solutions and a better understanding of how the requirements can best be met.  

The Postal Services intends to prequalify an adequate number of suppliers for the transportation of domestic mail by air with certificated Part 121 passenger airlines.  Of prime importance to the Postal Service is reliable on-time performance combined with network scope and scale.  

If you are interested in this opportunity, please submit information which demonstrates the following:

	Must be a Certificated Part 121 airline company.  (You need not send anything at this point to show your status; however, if necessary, the Postal Service may contact you and require the documentation.)
	Must agree to carry mailable hazmat and live mail in accordance with the USPS Domestic Mail Manual.
	Must have demonstrated business compatibility from both technical and business relations viewpoints.  Must state that you possess the ability to electronically scan bar-coded mail and transmit the data via electronic data interchange (EDI) to the Postal Service.
	Must be able accommodate mail between all lanes serviced; i.e., your entire network including transfer routings, and must have the ability to provide capacity between origins and destinations to which the Postal Service has demand.  
	Must be in an acceptable financial condition that will allow the Contracting Officer to determine that operations are to remain ongoing.

Additional information:

	The contract term is estimated to be from 2 to 5 years, beginning October 1, 2011.
	The service must be performed in accordance with all applicable US Federal and local authority transportation laws.
	Persons who handle the mail must be screened, to include a criminal background check, drug screening, fingerprinting, and must receive a clearance issued by the U. S. Postal Inspection Service, the federal law enforcement arm of the Postal Service.
	The Postal Service requires strict protection of the mail while in the possession of the supplier.  
	On-time performance standards will be a requirement based on mail product type.
	Supplier must be, or become, EDI-compliant within 90 days of start-up.
	Contract pricing and payment will be on a rate per pound depending upon the pounds of mail properly transported and scanned.

The above represent the primary requirements which are intended to allow the potential supplier to assess interest or to inquire further.  Other requirements and provisions will apply prior to any final contracting.

If you believe that you can accommodate the Postal Service requirements, please submit your responses to this office via e-mail message, US Mail, or fax (202 268 5879) on or before
August 6, 2010.

In responding to this RFI, a list of requested information follows:

	Company overview
	Subcontractors and code-share partners
	Supplier capabilities addressing the aforementioned requirements (e.g., carriage of HAZ-MAT and Lives)
	Network coverage
	Public financial information

Provision A-2:  Solicitation for Information on Planning Purposes (March 2006)

A.	The Postal Service does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to pay for the information solicited.
B.	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of potential suppliers registering interest in providing air transportation and supporting services.  

Your responses should be directed to:

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Norwich University Applied Research Institutes (NUARI). The contract is for development of a graduate level computer-based training (CBT) course on the topic of Culture and Irregular Conflict. Requirement 2483 published under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 09-Q-4554 on 10 March 2009 was for an Unconventional Warfare Operating Environment Distance Learning undergraduate course. Following a fair and open competition, the TSWG Training Technology Development (TTD) subgroup subject-matter experts (SMEs) and U.S. Army JFK Special Warfare Center and School SMEs selected NUARI as the best technical solution. NUARI possesses the specific combination of knowledge and course development experience in anthropology and sociology as well as DoD doctrine necessary for developing a similar graduate level course that educates a DoD audience on culture and irregular conflict. The work completed on the undergraduate course contract W91CRB-10-C-0054 and NUARIs set of expertise is applicable to the development of the proposed graduate level Culture and Irregular Conflict course. This sole source contract will leverage existing work on the original contract<BR>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than July 26, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<SUBJECT>Engineer Services - Feasibility Study for Great Lakes Science Center,  Ann Arbor, MI.  Study is to determine the benefits of relocating USGS researchers from the Indiana Dunes Lake Michigan Ecological Station into an alternative Visitor Center.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC) has a requirement for a feasibility study to determine the benefits of relocating USGS researchers working at the Indiana Dunes Lake Michigan Ecological Station from their present location into a Visitor Center presently owned by the National Park Service.
The Visitor Center will require extensive renovation to meet the needs of the USGS researchers to meet the important mission of the GLSC. The work may include the following: Renovation of office spaces, designing and building of laboratories, mechanical and utility equipment repair and replacement, ADA accessibility requirements, code compliance, security issues, parking areas and asbestos removal.
GLSC Lake Michigan Ecological Research Station's facility needs to be moved to a new building because it no longer can accommodate the personnel, functions, and mission of that unit nor comply with codes and good science practices. Scientists are not capable of performing their jobs in a safe and competent manner because of inadequate space and out of date facilities. The Station was originally a Nike Missile Base in the mid-1950s and is poorly suited for modern scientific investigations. Further, the Station has grown in function and personnel such that renovation, expansion or re-design could not resolve the current compliance and operational issues posed by this outdated facility. The National Park Service has offered USGS a building that will adequately accommodate the Lake Michigan Ecological Research Station. The building is approximately 50 years old.
Project Need/Benefit
The current facilities do not comply with OSHA or ADA codes in large part because of congestion, lack of space for separation of chemicals, pathogens and controlled access, proper storage, exits, ventilation and access to the facilities by challenged populations. Scientific experiments cannot be conducted because space is too limiting for instruments, ventilation, required separation of experiments (clean rooms, separation of molecular and processing areas, freezer space, polished water, storage facilities, meeting areas, parking, etc.). The new facility will allow the station to fulfill its mission to USGS partners in the Great Lakes and meet the requirements of a safe, accessible and productive scientific federal facility.
The study shall address the following items and issues:
1. The feasibility of using the Visitor Center to perform state of the art research important to the science mission of the Great Lakes Science Center.2. Document the deficiencies of the Visitor Center that will require repair/replacement to allow research to take place at this location.3. Provide cost estimates to correct or abate all deficiencies and costs of replacing and adding necessary equipment.4. Complete an energy study as part of the feasibility study to determine potential energy costs if the Visitor Center were to be rehabbed and occupied for research purposes.5. Provide operation and maintenance budget estimates to maintain the Facility each year.6. Complete a site inspection and provide drawings showing property boundaries and any legal right of ways required.7. Research and verify no known hazardous materials both within the Visitor Center and on the surrounding grounds either presently exist or did in the past. Provide guidelines for removal/remediation required.8. Provide written document showing any and all codes necessary to be followed to bring the asset and property into fully legal status for occupancy and scientific research.9. Calculate the current value of the property and building under this study and its value after completion of a renovation.10. Verify the Visitor Center is on and legally owned by the National Park Service, and outline general guidelines for transforming property and building to USGS ownership.11. Provide a cost estimate to move entire research operation into the renovated building.12. Complete the feasibility study within 90 days after notice of contract award.
This notice is an invitation for all eligible A&E firms who have the qualifications required to perform the work to submit a completed SF 330.  The associated solicitation number is 10ERQQ0439.  Responses are due on Thursday, 07/29/2010 at 3:00 pm CST.

<p>GIG &amp; Internet Connectivity to the Last Tactical Mile-Run net-centric web applications over your existing combat net radio with the ViaSat VDC-600 Data Controller. Featuring a credit card-sized PCMCIA form factor, the VDC-600 works with any tactical radio to deliver the Common Operating Picture - even over severely degraded radio channels. Take this highly portable ViaSat Data Controller (VDC) anywhere to send error-free data and employ TCP/IP services over existing radios, creating-network-centric connections that link warfighters on the-tactical edge to the Global Information Grid (GIG).-Using a combat net radio, computer, and Data Controller,-you can run IP-based critical combat communications-applications such as Cursor-on-Target, Situational Awareness,-Blue Force Tracking, whiteboard collaboration, chat,-messaging, and email.-</p>
<p>Single, TYPE II PCMCIA Card (3.3V OR 5V) --No external power supply needed-The VDC-600 is a type II card that complies with PC Card-Standard Release 8 for compatibility with the latest mobile PCs.-The advanced design of this PCMCIA card draws less than 750mW of power from the PC, requiring no external power supply-or additional batteries. The VDC-600 is field-proven to operate over a variety of noisy radio channels, including UHF SatCom,-UHF line-of-sight, VHF, HF, Inmarsat, and wireline channels.-The Data Controller supports networks of up to 64 users per channel with point-to-point, multicast, and broadcast messages.-This PC card is fully compliant with MIL-STD-188- 184, meets NDI and COTS requirements, and is backwards compatible with all ViaSat Data Controllers and Data Terminal Software. The VDC-600 also works with MIL-STD-188-220 software.-In a PC card form factor, the VDC-600 delivers the Common Operating Picture and IP connectivity over your existing combat net radio.-<br />OVER COMBAT <br />Real-time Data Compression - Reduces message size by 50%-The VDC-600 uses data compression to reduce the size of user-messages and shorten transmission times. Data from the user-is automatically compressed before transmission and restored-at the receiving end. The data compression algorithm typically-shrinks text files to less than 50% of their original size. It even-detects "incompressible" user data and sends it unaltered.</p>
<p>Enhanced Error Correction - Quick transfer, even-with poor channel-A combination of Forward Error Correction (FEC) and-Automatic Request for retransmission (ARQ) with a unique application-of diversity combining, transfers user data as quickly-as possible. These powerful error correction techniques send-data over poor quality channels with bit error rates in excess of-15%, as long as the radios are able to perform. The VDC-600-adapts the amount of FEC overhead to optimize throughput-and reduce airtime, and minimizing channel loading.</p>
<p>Built-in Networking with Multicast addressing-Messages can be addressed to a single destination or multicast,-with acknowledgements automatically collected and displayed-by the originating terminal.-</p>

(ii) Solicitation No. BBG50-R-10-0066DDS is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) and a contract will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures in FAR Part 15. (iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect from the Federal Acquisition Regulations 2005-041, dated May 13, 2010. (iv) The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541910. (v) The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB), Office of Contracts (CON) located in Washington, D.C. has a requirement for a Contractor to conduct qualitative research in Russia, Indonesia, Colombia and Ghana. The project will consist of research on the usage of mobile phones for news gathering. Contractor shall have demonstrated ability and experience in performing market research and public opinion polling services as outlined herein. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRE FIELDWORK: Research Project on Use of Mobile Devices for News Consumption
<p>The Voice of America is a U.S. based, publicly funded international broadcaster dedicated to providing objective news and information to audience in under-served media environments around the world. While traditionally focused on delivering its content via broadcast media, VOA is moving aggressively to expand distribution via new media platforms. In particular, recognizing the explosive growth of mobile telephony around the world VOA is attempting to reach audiences who are becoming accustomed to accessing news and information on mobile devices. To succeed in this effort, VOA requires a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of exactly how individuals are using mobile devices for news consumption.</p>
<p>VOA envisions obtaining the required insights through a series of qualitative research projects in 4 test markets: Russia, Indonesia, Colombia, and Ghana. Research subjects would be active users of mobile devices (telephones or smart phones) to received news on a regular basis. For the purpose of this study, "News" is defined as timely information about current events, whether political, security-related, economic, or other; individuals who use their mobile phones solely to received highly specialized services such as traffic reports or sports scores would not be included in this study. "Regular" is defined as at least 3-4 times per week. In addition, VOA is specifically interested in individuals who seek news on their mobile via Internet-based services; mobile owners who seek news solely by listening to radio on their mobile devices would not be of interest for this study.Following are some on the main questions that his project is expected to address:<br />&bull; Where and when do people use mobile devices to access news? How frequently during the day do people use mobile devices for this purpose? Do they use them primarily at certain locations (i.e. in transit, at work, etc.) or is there no particular pattern?<br />&bull; How does usage of mobile devices for news interact with the usage of traditional media? Are mobiles starting to suppliant traditional media or do they complement them?<br />&bull; More specifically, does consumption of Web-based news via mobile suppliant or complement consumption of such products via desktop computers or laptops?<br />&bull; Is the use of mobiles associated with a particular kind of news?<br />&bull; How do mobile new users want the news presented? Is there a preference for short headline-style news alerts or an appetite for more detail?<br />&bull; Do users want news in text format, or audio or video? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?<br />&bull; How do practical factors (costs, ease of navigation, bandwidth limitations, display constraints) affect use of mobile devices for news consumption?<br />&bull; What changes, in terms of technology, cost, content, or presentation would make it more attractive for people to received news via mobile devices?<br />&bull; To what extent are mobile news consumption patterns affected by handset features and network bandwidth. Are there differences between people with smartphones, features phones, and more basic handsets? Between people with 3G/3G+ access versus others?<br />&bull; Aside from hard news, what other kinds of information do individuals seek via their mobile devices?<br />These questions should be considered as a starting point, with the research pursuing other related avenues of inquiry as they arise. It is expected that in each country, the moderator of the focus groups shall have sufficient expertise in mobile technology and terminology used in the industry that he or she can authoritatively lead these discussions.<br />The research should be conducted via the use of focus groups, with four focus groups of approximately eight individuals to be conducted in each of the countries listed above. In additional to the requirement that research participants be regular consumers of news via mobile devices (as defined above), the groups should have the following characteristics: (1) participants should be between the ages of 18 and 35; 92) any gender mix is acceptable; 93) all participants should have at least complete secondary level education. To the extent practical, two groups in each country should consist of respondents with advanced handsets (smartphones or feature phone) and access to 3G networks; two groups in each country should consist of respondents with more basic phones and access to 2.5G (GPRS/EDGE) networks only.<br />CLIN 0001 - Qualitative Research on Use of Mobile phones for News Gathering - Qty 1 Lot<br />Deliverables shall include:<br />1) For each country, a narrative report of 20-30 pages in length, illustrated with quotations, address the main research questions cited earlier and any other significant issues that are raised in the course of research. Each report shall also include demographic details (age, gender, occupation) of each respondent, as well as - again for each respondent - - the brand and model of mobile device(s) used, the mobile network(s) they normally use, and the approximate amount of money they spend monthly on mobile services.<br />2) A summary report, of 20-30 pages in length providing overall conclusions based on the research and noting similarities and differences between the countries covered in the study with respect to the topics of interest.<br />3) Audio tapes of each focus group.<br />It is expected that the selected vendor will submit drafts of all of the above-mentioned deliverables for comment by VOA prior to the issuances of the final reports.<br />Draft reports to be submitted to VOA within two months after commencement of fieldwork, and final report within three months of commencement of fieldwork.

<p><strong>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:</strong> <br />The Government intends to use a tradeoff process to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contract Specialist determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br /><br />Upon receipt of proposals, the Contract Specialist will review them to determine if each offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below. An offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable. <br /><br />Evaluation Factors:<br /><strong>A. Technical Capabilities:</strong> The NIST will validate that a Contractor's technical quotation satisfies requirements. The NIST will assess how well a Contractor's technical quotation addresses NIST's requirements. A Contractor is not solely limited to discussion of these features. A Contractor may propose other features or attributes if the Contractor believes they may be of value to the NIST. If NIST agrees, consideration may be given to them in the evaluation process. In all cases, NIST will assess the value of each quotation as submitted. To enable NIST to determine the offeror's technical capability, the offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that the proposed equipment satisfies all of the technical requirements described in the statement of work. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The offeror should complete the attached "Minimum Requirements" document to include a line-by-line response to each requirement set forth herein. The Contractor shall respond as "exceed", "meets" or "does not meet". "Exceeds" means the Offeror meets every aspect of the required specification and exceeds one or more aspects of the required specification. The exceedance must be clearly documented in the quotation; "Meets" means the Contractor meets every aspect of the required specification as stated in the solicitation. There are no exceedances; "Does Not Meet" means the Contractor does not meet one or more aspects of the required specification. Those aspects that do not meet must be clearly documented in the quotation. The offeror shall also provide a reference to where its technical description of product literature supports the selection of "meets" or "exceeds."<br /><br /><strong>B. Past Performance</strong>: Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the products and services, provided by the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the names, addresses and phone numbers of at least two (2) customers who have purchased very similar systems in all major respects and where the system has been installed and accepted. The Contractor shall contact these two (2) customers and assure that they would be willing to be contacted by NIST staff to discuss the performance of their clusters. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or information from other sources, including NIST.<br /><br /><strong>C. Evaluated Price/Cost</strong>: The Government shall evaluate offerors based on the proposed price of the overall solution. <br /><br />Past performance and price will not be evaluated for offers that have been determined to be technically unacceptable, meaning the offer did not satisfy the requirements as laid out in the "Technical Capabilities" evaluation factor. Factors A and B are considered equal in weight. Factors A and B, when combined, are considered to be equal in weight to Factor C.<br /><br />The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government's interest.</p>
<p>The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Quotation Preparation Instructions

1) Price Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the completed price schedule. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The pricing quotation shall be separate from any other portion of the quotation.  The offeror should propose a firm-fixed-price, FOB Destination, for each CLIN.   Contractor shall state express warranty coverage.  Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.
2) Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: 
Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model.  The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature.  If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.

Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.

Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein.  The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein.  The quotation should include one of the following statements:

The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition.

OR

Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)

Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.  

Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<p>Statement of Work<br />WRD-10-15756</p>
<p><br />1.0 Organization</p>
<p><br />1.1 Organization</p>
<p>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources.</p>
<p>1.2 Background</p>
<p>The NWFSC East and Center buildings were built 1963. The climate control of these buildings is supplied by duct work running throughout each building. As in any other ventilation system, periodic cleaning of the duct work is necessary. Research Scientists require a clean environment to produce quality results. The last time the ventilation duct work was cleaned thoroughly was in 2005. The time lapse of four (4) years has proven to be an inadequate period of time in maintaining a clean research environment. We have received recent complaints of particles coming from the ceiling diffuser in critical laboratories and offices within the East and Center building.</p>
<p>1.3 Objective</p>
<p>Vendor is to thoroughly clean all ventilation duct work in the East and Center buildings. This includes but not limited to the supply air ducts, exhaust ducts, and all mixing boxes.</p>
<p><br />2.0 Contractor Requirements</p>
<p><br />2.1 Comply with all Federal, State, and local regulations for ventilation cleaning.</p>
<p>2.2 Must have a certification by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA).</p>
<p>2.3 Must employ Air Systems Cleaning Specialist (ASCS) certified by (NADCA).</p>
<p>2.4 The lead person for the crew (Foreman) shall be trained in asbestos identification and abatement procedures.</p>
<p>2.5 Crew shall be trained on lock-out and tag-out procedures.</p>
<p>2.6 Vendor must supply MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) on all cleaning materials used on this project.</p>
<p>2.7 Vendor must implement safety precautions outlined in Site Safety Procedures Pamphlet.</p>
<p>2.8 The contracted work will be performed after regular working hours.</p>
<p>2.9 The vendor will be required to provide photographs and utilize a borescope to help provide evaluation and documentation.</p>
<p>2.10 The crew working on site will be required to wear some form of company identification.</p>
<p>2.12 The vendor must provide bonding insurance documentation.</p>
<p>2.13 If electrical connections required for vendor equipment are other than standard connection, the vendor will be responsible for the cost of an electrical contractor to provide needed connections.</p>
<p>2.14 The vendor will coordinate with the janitorial contractor to assure cohesiveness in performing each assigned responsibilities.</p>
<p>2.15 The vendor will be required to take prompt corrective action upon notice of deficiency by the Facility Supervisor.</p>
<p>2.16 The vendor shall be in compliance with all confined space regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.0 Services Required</p>
<p>3.1 These tasks are a summary of guidelines to be carried<br />out by the contractor, and in no way represent the procedures on which the cleaning of the entire ventilation system of the east and center building is to be conducted.

<DESC>NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) is planning a research survey in the Southern California Bight (SCB) for highly migratory species including pelagic sharks, albacore, and swordfish during the summer of 2010. The overall goals of the survey are: 1) to conduct a fishery-independent longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks continuing a 14 year abundance time series; 2) to conduct trolling for albacore for the deployment of archival tags and to collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of North Pacific albacore entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; 3) to conduct longline fishing for swordfish to deploy archival tags and collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of swordfish entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; and 4) to collect oceanographic data to examine environmental effects on the distribution and catch rates of sharks, albacore, and swordfish. The survey is being conducted to support research and data needs identified by NMFS and affiliated scientific organizations and committees including the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), the International Scientific Committee for Tunas and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). Conducting albacore and swordfish sampling will also help address some of the objectives of the Swordfish Leatherback Use of Temperate Habitat (SLUTH) Initiative and the SWFSC/Albacore Industry Cooperative Research program and provide a better examination of the large pelagic fish component of the SCB ecosystem.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.  
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (NAVY)

WAWF PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVY CONTRACTS
 
The Navy approach to receipt, acceptance, and payment presents unique requirements in orders written on behalf of the Naval Media Center (NMC) that now must be processed for payment through WAWF.  The distinction between receipt and acceptance, much as it was for the Enterprise Resources Program (ERP), remains critical.   The NMC Supply Officer, Jim Kuhrt, is the current accepting party.  This fact would have to be added as text within the order since his DoDAAC will differ from the actual delivery address, which would be shown in Block 15 of the SF Form 1449. Directions for processing payments through WAWF for the NMC should be inserted as follows:
 
WAWF INVOICE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS.
 
WAWF contractor input information.
 
The contractor shall use the following information in creating electronic payment requests in WAWF:
 
To create electronic payment requests and receiving reports, go to the WAWF-RA production website at https://wawf.eb.mil
 
Select invoice type:
 
            If billing for materials only, select Combo
            If billing for materials and services, select Combo
            If billing for services only, select 2-n-1

Please note that this address is different from the delivery address noted in block 15 of the purchase/delivery order.

NOTE WHEN INPUTTING DODAAC ON WAWF FOR PAYMENT:
 
The payment office will always be DoDAAC HQ0251
The Local Processing Office will always be N00024
The Ship To will always be N49872
 
You will have a Ship To on your PRs that is not N49872 therefore, you will need to let the vendor know that in order to process an invoice in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) they must not use the DoDAAC that they actually shipped to.  For example, you may have a PR ship to DoDAAC code of N42315 and the vendor should ship to that DoDAAC, but he/she must input ship to DoDAAC N49872.  Yes, this is confusing Yes, this does make additional work for you See the attached WAWF payment instructions for further information.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.  


ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (NAVY)

WAWF PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVY CONTRACTS
 
The Navy approach to receipt, acceptance, and payment presents unique requirements in orders written on behalf of the Naval Media Center (NMC) that now must be processed for payment through WAWF.  The distinction between receipt and acceptance, much as it was for the Enterprise Resources Program (ERP), remains critical.   The NMC Supply Officer, Jim Kuhrt, is the current accepting party.  This fact would have to be added as text within the order since his DoDAAC will differ from the actual delivery address, which would be shown in Block 15 of the SF Form 1449. Directions for processing payments through WAWF for the NMC should be inserted as follows:
 
WAWF INVOICE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS.
 
WAWF contractor input information.
 
The contractor shall use the following information in creating electronic payment requests in WAWF:
 
To create electronic payment requests and receiving reports, go to the WAWF-RA production website at https://wawf.eb.mil
 
Select invoice type:
 
            If billing for materials only, select Combo
            If billing for materials and services, select Combo
            If billing for services only, select 2-n-1

The payment office will always be DoDAAC HQ0251
The Local Processing Office will always be N00024
The Ship To will always be N49872
 
You will have a Ship To on your PRs that is not N49872 therefore, you will need to let the vendor know that in order to process an invoice in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) they must not use the DoDAAC that they actually shipped to.  For example, you may have a PR ship to DoDAAC code of N42315 and the vendor should ship to that DoDAAC, but he/she must input ship to DoDAAC N49872.  Yes, this is confusing Yes, this does make additional work for you See the attached WAWF payment instructions for further information.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(2) (  ) Outside the United States. 

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)  (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)

(  ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror (  ) does (  ) does not certify that--

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.    

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><strong>Only offers meeting the listed technical capability criteria are eligible for award.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical Capability</strong></p>
<p>Quotes will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide factory new HEATCON items along with the required documentation to show traceability and conformance. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria. Only offerors meeting all of these criteria will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>Offerors that have obtained a pass rating on the technical criteria listed above will then be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br /><strong>1. Delivery<br />2. Price<br />3. Past Performance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delivery:</strong></p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information IAW the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest. <br /><br /><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirements listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. <strong>All offerors must comply with the requirements in section (b) of FAR 52-215-20 found below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Past Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years.

<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 02 August 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>The clause at FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (Mar 2009) ADDENDUM</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK:<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3)other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management<br />Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling <br />Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance <br />Contract Administration<br />Security <br />Testing</p>
<p>(b)The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c)The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<DESC>12 July 2010:&nbsp; The purpose of this modification is to post questions/answers from the site visit.<br />- This is an interim response as one question still needs an answer (#18) and one is incomplete (#20). I am working with CP and APS to get the desired information on those two. I will close the loop on these as soon as they<br />respond. I have also attached a revision to one of the control panel views as discussed in the response to #14.<br /><br />1. The solicitation calls for one (1) Touch Panel control device (Item 7) to be located at the lectern; the existing system has a small Touch Panel located in the EXEC A /EXEC B area. Will the new Touch Panel replace the old, or will the old remain as an additional control device?
<p>Answer: The new will replace the old.</p>
<p>2. You have indicated that there is to be no audio component (answer to question 7); is audio wiring between the new computer interfaces and the head-end switcher to be provided for possible future use?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>3. Who is responsible for demo/removal of old components (projector/mount, surface loudspeakers, projection screen, existing rack, etc.) not used in the new system?</p>
<p>Answer: The existing A/V system in the Alt ICC will need to be removed by the<br />offerer. The equipment belongs to and will need to be returned to the APS.</p>
<p>4. Who is responsible for cutting/ finishing of oak chair rail where it may impinge on new screen location?</p>
<p>Answer: The vendor who wins the contract is responsible.</p>
<p>5. Will it be possible to move computers and/or central worktable for projector installation? If so, who will?</p>
<p>Answer: The computers will not be in the room during the project. The conference table will remain in its current location.</p>
<p>6. During what hours will the room be made available to perform the work?</p>
<p>Answer: Bldg 977 is a 24/7 facility. The facility manager says work can be accomplished at any time. We will need to notify them when the project is scheduled to start.</p>
<p>7. The Screen Width extends the existing wall length, who will extend that wall for Installation of the larger Screen?<br />SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 1 (Projection System): Will the Government be responsible for extending the projection screen wall (drywall, painting, etc.) to the left outer building wall?</p>
<p>Answer: The existing wall does not need to be extended. All that is required is a framework from the existing wall to the adjacent wall to hold the screen. This will be the vendor's responsibility.</p>
<p>8. There are Audio Speakers installed on that wall, who will move them to make room for the new Screen?</p>
<p>Answer: The speakers attached to the wall will be removed for return to the owner just like the rest of the existing system.</p>
<p>9. Do you require 2 Projectors?</p>
<p>Answer: The project calls for two projectors because the requirement is to be able to project more that we are capable of now with a single projector.</p>
<p>10. Will the existing Podium be used or do you require a quote for a new one?</p>
<p>Answer: There will be a new, larger podium from a different source.</p>
<p>11. If there is any Electrical that needs to be installed for say the LCD Monitor will we add that install cost to the quote or will the GOV be responsible for installing Electrical?</p>
<p>Answer: We don't believe there will be any requirement to install electric. If there is, the contractor will need to advise so we can arrange for Interior Electric assistance.</p>
<p>12. The Solicitation calls out for AMX to be used will you consider an equal manufacturer such as Crestron?</p>
<p>Answer: The solicitation calls for brand name (AMX) or equal. So the answer is "yes".</p>
<p>13. What about Audio, will we be incorporating the existing Audio equipment into the System?</p>
<p>Answer: The solicitation does not call for audio, existing or otherwise.</p>
<p>14. What are the Sources that need to be run through the Switcher? How many PC's (this includes Laptop Connections at the Conference Room Table) will be used?</p>
<p>Answer: There are 8 sources, 7 of which are computers (only one is on the conference table). Seven are listed on the SOW under Matrix Switcher as inputs. The eighth is Flightline Cameras. This should have been shown as the eighth source on the AMX touch panel "Select Source" screen shot sample provided. The flightline cameras will project only on the LCD screen. All other sources must project on the screen and the LCD.</p>
<p>15. Is there an official bid form or document format that must be used to submit our proposal?<br /><br />Answer: There is no official bid form or document, just please be sure to have all line items listed and broken down by price like they are in the solicitation and email me your proposal.</p>
<p>16. SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 1 (Projection System): Will the Government be responsible for replacing trim on the projection screen wall and performing "detail" work?<br />Answer: This "detail" work is the responsibility of the vendor as part of providing a turnkey system.</p>
<p>17. SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 1 (Projection System): Will the Government be responsible for procuring and installing new ceiling tiles as necessary?</p>
<p>Answer: The base will provide replacement tiles for the vendor to install.</p>
<p>18. SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 1 (Projection System): What service (VA) feeds the exisiting ceiling mounted projector (110/120VAC - 15A? 20A?)</p>
<p>19. SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 2 (LCD Displays): Will the Government remove existing hardware where LCD display is to be placed and repair wall prior to contract work?</p>
<p>Answer: The existing hardware was for a bracket for an LCD screen that was previously wall mounted in the room. Contractor can use or remove this hardware as required for installation of the LCD screen. If removed, the LCD should cover hardware locations, and wall repair would not be necessary.</p>
<p>20. SOW, Page 1, Paragraph 1 (Projection System) What signal type (Composite Video?) is to be pulled from the CP to the LCD display and where exactly does it originate in the CP?</p>
<p>Answer: A cable feed from the flightline camera system is currently available in the ceiling above the electrical outlet for the LCD screen. It was fed to an LCD that was hung there at an earlier time.</p>
<p>21. SOW, Page 2, Paragraph 1 (Matrix Switcher): It is noted that there are 7 sources and specifically 1 classified laptop. Are there any TEMPEST/OPSEC considerations to be aware of? Are there any issues or technical considerations (fiber optic requirements, conduit, etc.) which need to be implemented?</p>
<p>Answer: We understand this is not an issue because the signal sent through the system is video, not data.</p>
<p>22. SOW, Page 4, (Equipment Specifications): Is the physical size of the projector actually limited as stated ("cannot exceed 9.2"x10.9"x3.7")?</p>
<p>Answer: A small difference shouldn't be a major issue. We do want to minimize their bulk as much as possible.</p>
<p>23. SOW, Page 10, (Warranty): With regards to the service calls requested, is the Government open to a T&amp;M (Time and Materials) contract for this portion or this with the installations, an all-inclusive FFP (Firm Fixed Price) award only.</p>
<p>Answer: The warranty as stated in the SOW is as desired.</p>

<DESC>Due to technical questions posed by a potential offeror, the following is issued as clarification:<br /><br />
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (1):</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">4.1 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The spec for the Support Table <span style="COLOR: black">is</span> 1m x 2m, if this is true ...</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The KOHZU XZ with the Goniometer (without "D" crystal package) has a width of 660mm + 25mm travel = 685mm total. This allows only 290mm for the 5 axis Single Goniometer assembly minus the profile X widths of both the "D" and "C/W" packages. Note: the "X" width of the KOHZU = 330mm</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (1):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">It would be acceptable for part of the X-stage (the motor and its mounting, for example) to overhang the edge of the table.&nbsp; This would allow the stages to fit within half the table width with 30 mm or so left from the table center to the KTG-16W mounting face.&nbsp; The 25 mm travel does not necessarily need to be included in this calculation.&nbsp; We will "manually" control for collisions between the opposing motion assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (2):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">4.2 SUPPORT TABLE</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">Are </span>independent rails not required since the Z carriers are removable from the table? (Figure 3)</strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (2):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">We want the (nominal) ability to remove any particular set of XZ-stages so that an adjoining XZ-stage can be repositioned on the table without disturbing the motion stages stacked onto it.&nbsp; (We recognize however that even with the design in the specification this will not be possible in all cases.)&nbsp; The issue is the removal of the carriages used for the rails.&nbsp; We anticipated that some form of standard profile rail would be used for the XZ-stages.&nbsp; The carriages for these stages are typically not removable from the rail (except by sliding them off the end of the rail).&nbsp; If a potential offeror has a design in mind which will allow the carriages to be directly removed from the rails we would <span style="COLOR: black">take this into consideration</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (3):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Table 1. <span style="COLOR: black">Is t</span>he footprint 1M X 2M? If so, what is the preferred Z width of the (7) Z Carriers?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (3):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The base of the Kohzu KHI-4SK linear stage is approximately 200 mm.&nbsp; This would be the minimum width of the XZ-stages.&nbsp; Thus<span style="COLOR: black">:&nbsp; </span>7 x 200 mm = 1400 mm, leaving 600 mm of free space for adjustments to the positions in the Z direction.&nbsp; (It <span style="COLOR: black">is acceptable </span>for the motion stages above the XZ-stages to overhang this 200 mm dimension.)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (4):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">4.3 DUAL AXIS HIGH PRECISION GONIOMETERS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A few discrepancies exist<span style="COLOR: black"> in the specifications for the Kohzu stages:&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;the KHI-4SK load capacity is 50kg. The Goniometer weighs 50kg +8 kg for your temp comp package + adapter plates. This exceeds the X-Z rating</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (4):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Yes, this does appear to be correct.&nbsp; However, this is the arrangement recommended by <span style="COLOR: black">the manufacturer, </span>Kohzu.&nbsp; B<span style="COLOR: black">SA</span> will assume responsibility for this aspect of the design.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (5):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Repeatability is requested at 0.5um, <span style="COLOR: black">yet </span>the KOHZU XZ states 3um</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (5):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The catalog information <span style="COLOR: black">we possess </span>states +/-0.5 um repeatability<span style="COLOR: black"> for Kohzu Model KHI-4SK</span>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (6):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Does a dimensional detail exist of the "D" crystal packaging?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (6):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">No; n</span>ot at this time.&nbsp; We do have some preliminary 3D models worked up, but they are not complete.&nbsp; We will be constructing a similar (not identical) set of these units for testing in the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (7):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">Are p</span>ayload requirements defined in the technical specification<span style="COLOR: black">?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">BSA Clarification (7):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">No</span>.&nbsp; It is felt that the proposed load for the Kohzu stages is within their capability.&nbsp; B<span style="COLOR: black">SA</span> will assume responsibility for this aspect of the design.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">QUESTION (8):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">4.4 SINGLE AXIS GONIOMETER</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">Is it acceptable to</span> provide <span style="COLOR: black">our </span>own XY stage design to achieve the required specifications<span style="COLOR: black">?</span></strong></p>

                        SHIP AND DIRECT SHIPMENT (DMA)(OCT 2008) 

The Contractor shall attach two (2) copies of a detailed packing list with each box or container with unlike items where the full description of the contents is not authorized or cannot be shown.  Include one (1) copy of the packing list inside the box or container and attach one (1) copy of the packing list on the outside of the box or container.  The outside of the box or container must also include the complete shipping address as provided in the schedule and the Contract/Purchase/Delivery Order number located on Page 1 of this document. 

The packing list shall contain the following information:  

     (a)  Contract number/Purchase Order number or Delivery Order number
     (b)  Package number and set number (if any) of the container.  
     (c)  A list of the contents which shows the quantity by item, item description, part
number, type and size, unit of issue if other than each.  
     
NOTE!
The government WILL NOT ACCEPT items shipped without a packing list especially when the content of the package is unidentifiable; rejected items will be returned at the contractors expense.  

INCOMPLETE DELIVERIES 

Incomplete delivery refers to the incomplete shipment of a unit of issue of an individual contract line item (CLIN).   Such Incomplete, or fragmented delivery of any part of a CLIN is not authorized and will not be accepted.   Each item (CLIN), including all components and sub-items, is to be delivered complete. Where sub-line items are reflected as component parts of an item, all sub-line items must be delivered simultaneously to form the complete item.


INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS - MANDATORY:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.  

52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002)

An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the Technical Assistance Group.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG Team. USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor who will provide OFDA with technical assistance in program assessment and planning, specifically related to disaster risk reduction. This will involve strategy development and implementation, monitoring of DRR activities, providing representation at international forums, and other related activities.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team.

REVERSE AUCTIONING

The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.

<DESC>Q.  Is there any place to stay onsite?A. Sometimes there is room in the bunkhouse, but not always. 
Q. Who provides seed?  Is the polymer and charcoal provided?A.  I provide the seed and polymer and the charcoal. Q. What is the seed mix? A. It is not a seed mix, but seven individual species each seeded separately within each plot.  Each species will be 6 feet x 40 feet.  The species list is Western wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, needle & thread, Inland saltgrass, Indian ricegrass, alkali sacaton, and bottlebrush squirreltail.
Q. Is another brand of rangeland drill seeder okay besides Kincaid if it's the same size/capability? A. The design calls for a Kincaid/Truax research plot drill with leading residue cutters or chiseltype furrow openers.  A substitute can be used if proved to accomplish the exact same thing. Q.  Exp't 1: Is seedbed already tilled, kochia stubble?A.  The kochia stubble is not tilled.  Q. Exp't 2: Is seedbed already tilled? Is it to be drill seeded or broadcast?A.  The kochia stubble is not tilled.  The rest have a cover crop or nurse crop to be planted so have been tilled and they are drilled. Q . Will data entry for weed study be done by FWS or by contractor? A. For the weed study it will be done by FWS.  Q. Can we publish these results?A. Yes. I hope so!!  Q. What is the success criteria for the seeding? Liability if part of it fails?A. I sure hope we find at least one technique, but preferable several techniques that will yield successful seeding.  What is success?  Establishment of at least one species but at what percent cover has not been established.  In a desert area such as us - it won't be that high.  Liability if it fails - you dealing with a very bummed biologist trying to do restoration on these disturbed fields.  I guess we go to plan C.Q. What is the Unit of Issue? Many of the Unit of Issue units are listed in "Months." Does this constitute a contractual obligation to be available for the entire two months or does is merely serve as a time frame for work completion? For example, the rental price for equipment will be much cheaper for the two weeks the equipment is actually used, rather than an entire two month block.  It serves as a time frame for work completion. A.  Most work in the field can actually be completed in a manner of days, but with weather and personnel schedules, exact dates are not possible.  The dates are more of a window in which work could be completed.  The exception would be the monitoring of the plots.  That may take several weeks of field work to complete. Q. Irrigation. Are there details available about what irrigation materials will be provided and about gallons per minute that will be available and the PSI at connection? Or will this information come post-award?A. This is what I have used in the past.  We have 2 pumps we can run and each pump was capable of running about 12 sprinklers for 3 hours.  I was using fire hose and garden hose to run irrigation out in the field and each sprinkler covered about 45 feet radius and would total about 5 mm of water on the ground.  I was planning on using the same set-up with some improvement in the sprinklers so they would be consistent among the sprinklers. Q. Seeding. Will seed be provided? A. Yes Q. Charcoal Banding Equipment. Are there specific guidelines for the equipment to deliver active charcoal? Is a dry or slurry application preferred?A. I am not familiar with this technique so it is contractor preference. Q. Polymer. The legend in the Study 1 map shows "banded polymer" and the legend in the Study 2 map shows "polyacrylamide polymer." Will the same PAM be used in both studies or are two different products being referenced? A. It is a polyacrylamide polymer applied as banded dry application.
Q. Monitoring. Will the contractor be responsible for the monitoring schedule or does the NWR have existing guidelines for when and how often monitoring will occur? A monitoring schedule will be written into the Native Grass Monitoring Plan if no guidelines exist.A. Contractor will be responsibleQ.       Are we supposed to include labor and power for the farm equipment listed in the solicitation, i.e., do we provide the tractor in the price?A. The Refuge will provide a farm tractor and a person to drive it, plus a couple people to help with installation.Q.  What type of statistical analyses are you looking for or do we just summarize the data for inclusion in someone else's analyses?A. The studies are designed and replicated to provide a 2-way or 3-way factorial design suitable for ANOVA and multivariate analyses.  The analyses need to be done by the contractor.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">RECOVERY-The Government intends that any resulting procurement action will be funded in part under the authority of, and in accordance with the requirements of, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).<br /><br />NOAA has a requirement for a genotype and statistical analysis for salmon. The contractor shall provide these services to support the operations of Russian River, California fish hatchery facilities owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and operated by the California Department of Fish and Game, by providing genetic data and analysis on fish raised and spawned at these facilities, as well as technical expertise regarding their effects on US Endangered Species Act-listed coho salmon and steelhead both in the Russian River basin and beyond. Genetic broodstock management practices have been developed to avoid mating of close relatives and consequent inbreeding depression. Molecular genetic data from 18 microsatellite genes will be collected, coefficients of relatedness estimated and then used to construct a breeding matrix which specifies optimal, acceptable and unacceptable mating partners for every reproductively mature fish. The contractor shall provide services which will include the following: (1) Evaluation of coho salmon production by genetic analysis of broodstock and creation of matrices for potential breeding partners in the 2009-10 breeding season; (2) Evaluation of steelhead production by genetic analysis of broodstock from the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to estimate inbreeding and hatchery selection; and (3) Evaluation of differentiation of steelhead trout produced at WSH and CVFF, with those born in natural areas through genetic analysis of both groups of fish.</p>

<DESC>CHANGE 1, dated 6 July 2010: Revised Attachment 10, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) List.<BR><BR>CHANGE 2, dated 7 July 2010: Added information concerning instructions for obtaining additional Government Technical Data.<BR><BR>CHANGE 3, dated 12 July 2010: Added information concerning program priorities.<BR><BR>This posting is a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment.      <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE).  The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE.  SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability.  <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements.  SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements.  The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables.  The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network.  These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter.  New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight.  SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512.  The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  The Government anticipates that the SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.   This is a Draft RFP and PEO STRI anticipates issuing the final RFP on 16 August 2010.<BR><BR>The proposal should be based on the program of record anticipated funding identified herein. <BR><BR>To assist in determination of appropriate allocation across Statements of Work, the following is provided: Top priorities are Transition Phase-In and Production related CLINS.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS ONLY  AVAILABLE to Lockheed Martin Management Systems Designers, Inc. for reasons as described below. 

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established a tax credit for first-time homebuyers is worth up to $7,500.   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the first-time homebuyer credit by increasing the amount to $8,000.   The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009, signed into law on Nov. 6, 2009, extended and expanded the first-time homebuyer credit allowed by previous Acts. 

This opportunity provided software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the IRS Integrated Customer Communications Environment (ICCE) program.  ICCE provides software applications and connections for both phone and web interactive applications, including economic stimulus related applications.  The existing economic stimulus component of ICCE is being modified to accommodate Voice Response Unit (VRU) message changes and menuing in response to legislative initiatives resulting from Homebuyer Tax Credit initiatives.  This ARRA work was added via modification to a previously competed ICCE task order under the authority of FAR 16.505 utilizing the existing IRS Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Indefinite Quantities (IDIQ) contract.  The modification was  executed as a fixed-price award fee action.

, Indianapolis, IN 46219-2001 US
<DESC>Rationale Justifying FAR 6.302-1, "Only One responsible source and on other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements":<br />Only RTSC has the expertise to integrate capabilities across many different V-22 avionics hardware, software, and ground station projects to achieve a level of efficiency that helps maintain operational effectiveness and reduce cost and schedule impacts. As the sole-source incumbent contractor, RTSC possesses a highly trained team of engineers with intricate knowledge of and experience with V-22 avionics systems, software, laboratories, and related products. This uniquely equips RTSC with the capability to simultaneously provide post-production resolution of fleet issues and enhancements for both the MV-22 and CV-22, engineering releases for test and validation, and Block Fleet Releases. Therefore, the Navy&nbsp;has awarded this requirement to RTSC on a&nbsp;sole source&nbsp;basis under 10 U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1) as cited in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br /><br />Rationale for CPFF/CPIF Contract Type:<br />Uncertainties involved in&nbsp;contract performance prevent estimation of costs with sufficient accuracy.
