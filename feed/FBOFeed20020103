Comments and questions will be considered and addressed in the final BAA/SOW. TYPE OF CONTRACT: The Government anticipates the use of an Other Transactions type agreement. Offerors may propose alternate contract types provided that the alternative is supported in the proposal and the Government agrees. The objective of the HTSS program is for the development and prototype fabrication of sensor systems which will provide the vehicle commander of present and future armored and infantry vehicle with increased situational awareness on the battlefields. The H TSS program will develop a sensor suite to provide vehicle commanders with a day/night 360o x 110o (-20 o to +90 o) dome of situational awareness (SA) coverage, enabling optical connectivity with the dismounted infantry in closed hatch operations for the u rban fight. HTSS is slaved to the movement of the commander’s head, employs the Low Power Uncooled InfraRed (LPUIR) FLIR (provided as GFE) that is image fused with Image Intensified (I2) imagery for optimum performance and to see battlefield pointers; has a coded high power laser pointer to direct fire for other vehicles or dismounted soldiers; uses an eyesafe laser rangefinder to facilitate target location; and has an on-board intrusion detection system to provide the crew SA in the immediate vicinity of t he vehicle to protect from a dismounted attack. HTSS will be integrated into the SA network, assisting the commander in quickly locating enemy targets, enabling coordinated fires with other force assets, and providing enhanced close combat operations.

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the North Shore University Hospital for a five year continuation of a project entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  During the next five years of this project the contractor will: 1) expand the analysis of sib pairs to include existing national and international collections and perform Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) analyses on all sib pair collections; 2) collect 1,000 rheumatoid arthritis trios to conduct association studies based on genetic regions of interest identified during sib pair analysis; and 3) establish collaborative arrangements for the conduct of hypotheses driven projects using resources previously generated.  The projects will focus on genetics, pathogenesis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. 

The North Shore University Hospital has the prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work under contract N01-AR-7-2232 entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available.  Any questions should be directed to Donna Baker, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, NIAMS, at 301-594-2543 or by e-mail at db394u@nih.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short-term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.  

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work.

For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens.

<DESC>Special Note:  Reference Orginial CBDNet Submission No. 5154K2, Dated December 20, 2001.

Subject to availability of funds, the United States Agency for International Development to Honduras (USAID/Honduras) intends to post a request for proposals for technical assistance to establish the strategic results required to ensure a successful initial implementation by Honduras justice sector institutions, particularly the Judiciary, of the new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC).  The CPC, as approved by the National Congress in December of 1999 and published into law in May of 2000, is due for full implementation nationwide on February 20, 2002.  Contract work should build upon and/or be incorporated into sector activities as currently supported by USAID, pursuant to a multi-phase work plan - the Inter-institutional Road Map for CPC implementation, developed in consultation with an Inter-institutional Commision for Criminal Justice Reform established in 2000.  The resulting Contract will be for an 18 month-period.  USAID/Honduras will seek proposals from qualified U.S. firms to deliver the services described above.  This procurement is a full and open competition.  The issuance date of the RFP is expected to be approximately 01/15/02.  The closing date for submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be approximately thirty (30) days thereafter.  The NAIC code for this procurement is 541990.  

To obtain a copy of the RFP, write or telefax to the below address with the solicitation number, company address and phone number of contact person.  To ensure timely receipt of solicitation amendments and provide the maximum response time, please also provide telefax number, if available.  Phone requests will not be honored.

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide solicitations on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions.  You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that you have received this solicitation through the Internet.  As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.  Generally, the Agreement Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the FBO Site.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the Children's Hospital National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20010, to provide a board certified pediatric cardiologist with demonstrated clinical experience, and proven research expertise in the study of cardiovascular structure and function in vertebrate embryos.  Background Information: The Laboratory of Development Biology is initiating a new  project to identify novel gene and genetic pathway essential for mammalian heart development.  This gene discovery based project will entail using ultrasound imaging to conduct a high throughput screen for cardiovascular anomalies in mutagenized mice.  Mouse mutations identified in this manner will aid in the mapping and identification of novel genes that are essential for cardiovascular development.  Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:  The specific objective of this research is the identification of recessive lethal mouse mutations that cause heart defects.  A clinical pediatric cardiologist with knowledge and research experience in cardiovascular developmental embryology will greatly facilitate the identification of novel mouse mutations causing cardiovascular anomalies of clinical significance.
Requirements:  The pediatric cardiologist will help develop a protocol for the high through put screen and define the specific parameters to be analyzed.  Of particular importance is expertise in the use of various imaging modalities for the analysis of fetal mouse heart development and function, and the ability to relate cardiovascular phenotypes in mouse models to clinical cardiovascular congenital anomalies and pathology.  The individual will assist in defining the screening protocol, and train the person who will actually conduct the high through put screen at the Jackson Laboratory. In addition, the Pediatric Cardiologist will help analyze the ultrasound data gathered from the mutagenized mice, and based on this evaluation, determine which mutagenized mouse lines are to be brought back to NHLBI for further analysis.   The Pediatric Cardiologist will undertake a detailed analysis of cardiovascular structure and function using imaging modalities including MRI micro-CT, micro-PET, and Doppler echocardiography.   Government Responsibilities:  The Laboratory of Developmental Biology in DIR, NHLBI, NIH, will provide all of the equipment, computer hardware and software required for this project.   The work of this individual will be reviewed and approved by the Project Officer.
Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:  The pediatric cardiologist will present the progress to date on a monthly basis in a seminar style presentation to the laboratory, and in particular will discuss the potential clinical relevance of any cardiovascular phenotypes observed amongst the mutagenized mice.   When appropriate, the work will be written up as manuscripts for publication.     Period of Performance: The period of performance is January 2002 through December 2002.   This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541710.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

  		DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this contract is to provide the Department of State (DOS) with litigation support to effectively defend the Department in litigation pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  Under the direction of the Department?s Office of the Legal Adviser, the contractor shall represent the DOS in the litigation by dedicating a team of highly experienced litigation personnel and support services to the case.
BACKGROUND
A former employee has filed an action against the DOS with the Washington, D.C. Regional Office of the MSPB.  The former employee alleges that various current and former high level officials at the DOS retaliated against her because she made numerous protected disclosures to Congress and the media regarding waste, fraud and abuse at the United Nations.  Specifically, the former employee complains of a poor performance rating and other acts, which she claims ultimately, led to her removal from the DOS. The former employee?s allegations have been the subject of extensive media coverage and have garnered the attention of a significant number of members of Congress.
The Department has been defending the litigation before the MSPB for approximately one-year.  To date, the parties have completed two rounds of written discovery and filed the concomitant motions.   The parties have produced more than 3200 pages of documents.  The former employee has been deposed along with one Department official.   Additional depositions can be expected along with various pre-hearing briefs.  The DOS estimates that the hearing in this matter could involve as many as thirty-five witnesses and proceed for as many as 40 days.
USER ORGANIZATION	
Within the Department, the Office of the Legal Adviser will direct and monitor the services provided under this contract.  The headquarters of the Office of the Legal Adviser is located at U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW, Washington, D.C.  20520.

Source selection for this procurement will be conducted on a best value basis; therefore, submittal of technical and price proposals is required.  The Technical Criteria will require the offeror to submit a substantial amount  of documentation. The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions, based solely upon initial offers and without the opportunity for revised proposals.  If award is not made on initial offers, discussions will be conducted in accordance  with FAR Part 15.   Accordingly, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a quality and price/cost standpoint.  If however, revised proposals are requested, they will be evaluated against the same criteria as the initial proposals.  The Government's primary objective in selecting an awardee is to make a Best Value determination by employing a subjective assessment of each offer that seeks to balance all of the stated evaluation factors against the offeror’s proposed integration of th ose factors in its offer.  Award will be made to that responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, cost and other criteria considered.  Thus, in making the overall  Best Value decision, the Gove rnment will consider the value of each proposal in terms of the technical and past performance offered for the estimated cost.  The contract could, therefore, be awarded to other than the low final offeror, if it is determined to represent the greatest val ue to the government; however, the total cost is significant in that the Government may not be capable of awarding a contract simply because the proposal cannot be afforded.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria.  EVALUATI ON CRITERIA:  Proposal Evaluation.  Proposals must clearly demonstrate an understanding of this solicitation as presented by the Offeror.  Offe

In conjunction with NCI purchasing the above services, NCI will become a co-sponsor of the symposium.  The purpose of the symposium is to strengthen the relationships between the Baylor Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC) and other major educational outreach, and research organizations, including NCI.

Baylor College of Medicine is the only known source to the National Cancer Institute that provides such a significant symposium with the visibility needed to Aclose the gap@ on health disparities, including cancer, in racial and ethnic minority and medically underserved populations in the United States.  The Symposium is one of the largest key national forums to showcase successful program strategies to reach minority and medically underserved people with cancer information.  There is no other source known to NCI that sponsors a symposium for this purpose and involves the number of national organizations involved with minorities, medically underserved, and cancer. This is not a request for competitive proposal quotation.  However, if any interested party is qualified to provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a five-year reimbursable contract to continue the work, and expand the impact, of the Agency?s Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) Program - a flagship program within AHRQ.  Work required under this contract will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuance of Task Orders. 
Under the new EPC Program (EPC II) tasks will address a variety of assignments, such as development of brief and comprehensive evidence reports and technology assessments related to clinical and behavioral topics, organization and financing topics, health care systems of delivery, and special cost effectiveness studies. The reports and assessments will be systematic reviews that are based on rigorous, comprehensive syntheses and analyses of relevant scientific literature, emphasizing explicitly detailed documentation of methods, rationales, and assumptions. Evidence reports and technology assessments may require systematic reviews and analyses of effectiveness and/or cost effectiveness of: established medical management of specified clinical conditions; established or new technology assessments; clinical preventive medicine; established and new uses of complementary and alternative therapies; and established or new strategies to organize and finance health care. EPCs also may be directed to undertake methodological research, develop evidence-based academic curricula on methods and processes for performing systematic reviews and assessments, and other special projects.  Periods of performance for completion of evidence reports and technology assessments will vary, ranging from 30 days up to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the topic, depth of review required, and programmatic need.  EPCs  will be expected to have the methodological competence and management flexibility to satisfy a range of single and multiple tasks that need to be performed concurrently. 
 Offerors are expected to have methodological expertise in the assessment of a broad range of scientific data, including results from social sciences and behavioral research, controlled trials, diagnostic studies, technology assessments, and epidemiologic research. To evaluate offeror?s methodological expertise, the information set out below must be included in each proposal.  Specifically, offeror?s process for:  (1) identifying scientific questions within a given topic that are of the greatest importance with respect to clinical practice or policy;  (2) identifying specific types of evidence that would be appropriate to answer important questions related to a given topic; (3) identifying, and the criteria for selecting, sources of evidence, including strategies for describing explicit details of the literature review to facilitate future updates of evidence reports; (4) evaluating individual studies for issues that may affect the validity of individual study results, including consideration of both internal and external validity; (5) synthesizing results of data from multiple individual studies; and (6) conveying results from syntheses in ways that communicate readily to relevant audiences for each evidence report or technology assessment.
In addition to systematic literature reviews and analyses, an EPC may be tasked to: (1) perform special analyses, such as meta-analysis, cost effectiveness analysis, decision analysis; (2) perform special cost effectiveness studies; (3) update EPC reports and assessments; (4) undertake methods research; (5) collaborate with academic medical centers, payors and employer groups, non-profits, and other private sector entities in, for example, developing evidence-based curricula, providing training opportunities to junior faculty, Fellows, etc. from other academic institutions in how to conduct systematic reviews and assessments, or in conducting educational sessions on interpretation and understanding of research

<CONTACT>Matthew Asai, (202) 493-4751
<DESC>The following information is provided as a supplement to the NEXCOM Industry Day events of October 3-5, 2001.  This announcement is intended to acquaint potential offerors with the current status of the acquisition program strategy and to coordinate upcoming Industry Day II activities. <P> Based on discussions and recommendations from potential offerors, the NEXCOM ground system acquisition strategy has been refined.  To convey the nature of these changes to potential offerors, the FAA will conduct a second series of Industry Day one-on-one discussions during January 22-25, 2001.  These discussions are intended to provide potential offerors with an updated program strategy for the Rapid Preliminary Development Effort (RPDE) and the subsequent Full Scale Development Program (FSDP). All one-on-one sessions will be held at TRW facilities located at 475 School Street, S. W., Washington, D.C.  An FAA/Potential offeror discussion agenda is included in this announcement. <P> ONE-ON-ONE DISCUSSIONS <P> Those companies wishing to participate in the one-on-one discussions should be limited to prime contractors and their teams who have demonstrated capabilities to perform all tasks identified in the program overview above. These companies should forward their request to andrea.ctr.haines@faa.gov  - Phone: (202) 314-1185, NLT January 15, 2001.  All personnel planning to attend should forward their name, company, title, and email address.  This will facilitate management and security processing of attendees.  The available time slots will be filled on a “first-come-first-serve” basis.  Each session will be up to two hours long.  In order to provide interested parties with an opportunity for individual discussions, the scheduling will be for one session per potential offeror.   NEXCOM GROUND NETWORK SYSTEM PROGRAM OVERVIEW <P> The NEXCOM Ground Network System Program will design, develop, and produce the cost-effective and logistically supportable ground network/switching communications components required to integrate the NEXCOM Multi-mode Digital Radio with the existing voice switches and the FAA backbone data routers.  The resulting integrated system consisting of subsystems such as the Radio Interface Unit (RIU), and the Ground Network Interface (GNI) will provide the air/ground communication transmission system for both backward compatible analog voice and the new digital voice and the ATN subnetwork for datalink based on VHF Digital Link Mode 3 standards.  This scalable system will be implemented first in the en-route domain and subsequently in the terminal, tower and flight service station environments. <P> To satisfy the short-term demonstration needs of the program in the 2004 timeframe, while reducing risk for meeting system IOT&E in 2007, the acquisition is divided into the 2 phases identified as the Rapid Preliminary Development Effort (RPDE) and the Full Scale Development (FSD) program.  These two phases will be separate competitive awards, however, only those potential offerors receiving an award for the RPDE will be eligible for the phase 2 program.   <P> The RPDE solicitation will include a request for a potential offeror-proposed system architecture based upon the System Requirements Document.  This architecture will be considered the preliminary architecture upon which the potential offeror shall build subsequent technical documentation in the efforts described below.  It shall demonstrate the potential offerors understanding of the existing air/ground communications system and the transition challenges in proceeding from analog to digital voice and datalink.  Such concerns as producibility, logistics supportability, planned system expansion, technology refresh, and RMA shall be addressed in this architectural framework.  Additionally, the solicitation will include demonstrated capability to design and develop hardware and software covering all subsystems in the air/ground communications string.

<DESC>This is simply a re-issue of the notice that was posted on December 26, 2001 in order to obtain additional interested subcontractors/suppliers.  No information has changed.  The notice on 12/26/01 stated the following: 

This is a modification to the original synopsis of Solicitation Number GS-03P-01-CDC-0144 for construction of a Federal Courthouse Annex in Wheeling, West Virginia.  The estimated cost of this project is between $15 million and $25 million.  Please note that this is only a range in a $10 million increment as required by GSA?s regulations. The approximate duration of the contract is 18 months, and is expected to begin in early 2002.  The contract for demolition of the existing structures has been completed.  The contract for construction of the foundation is proceeding and is expected to be completed in March, 2002.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

Technical proposals have been received from the following six general contractors:  Dick Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA; Jendoco Construction Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA; Mascaro Construction Company, Pittsburgh, PA; Massaro Company, Pittsburgh, PA; P.J. Dick Incorporated, Pittsburgh, PA; and Ross & Kennedy Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA.  Only these firms may submit price proposals in the next phase.  GSA has advised each general contractor, based on GSA's technical evaluation, whether it does or does not have a reasonable chance of being selected for this project.  It is their decision whether they pursue this project further.  

In the technical phase, general contractors were required to submit four subcontractors for each of the following trades: Curtainwall, Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing, and Granite.  The qualifications of these firms were evaluated and included as part of the general contractors' overall technical evaluation.  In the next phase, general contractors shall be required to select one subcontractor in each trade from those already submitted.  No other subcontractors may be submitted in these trades.  As part of the next phase, general contractors will be required to submit a preliminary subcontracting plan, where they will be required to demonstrate how they plan to meet GSA's subcontracting goals in the following categories:  Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, HUBZone Certified, and Service-Disabled Veteran.

Final bid documents are being issued to the general contractors the week of December 24, 2001 for pricing purposes.  Subcontractors, suppliers and other interested parties may view and/or obtain copies of the construction documents through one of the following three locations:

<DESC>The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is actively seeking licensees and/or CRADA partners to collaborate on the development and commercialization of the WorldWide Weather Workstation (W4). It is the intent of FSL to collaborate with industry on certain technical aspects of the system, such as data broadcast via satellite and end user requirements analysis. The W4 system is designed to meet the forecast needs of developing nations or for forecast situations where no data access is available. The system is designed to use a satellite broadcast or the internet to disseminate atmospheric data at continental or regional scales. To reduce hardware costs to the user while providing a high level of system performance, both the server subsystem and the user subsystem will utilize PC Linux platforms. The W4 system is based on the FSL developments for the AWIPS system that has allowed major improvements in National Weather Service offices throughout the country. W4 uses a series of scales, just as the AWIPS system does, that will allow a display to be compatible with the size and type of  the weather feature that is being studied. Important workstation features such as roam and zoom, predefined sets of procedures (sets of forecast products designed for a specific type of storm), family graphics, and toggle capabilities for displayed products are available. All data can be broadcast using technologies such as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) systems or other low bandwidth solutions. The Forecast Systems Laboratory has done innovative, groundbreaking work on data compression, particularly using wavelet transform compression that will allow a full set of data to be transmitted over a 128 kbps satellite link. Application of these data compression techniques will be applied both to satellite observations and imagery and gridded Numerical Weather Prediction model data sets. There will be only a very small reduction in data resolution after decompression at the receiver side of the process. The significant improvements in efficiency of transmission will contribute to decreasing the operational costs of using the system. For world areas where internet connectivity is available, an internet version of W4 is also available. FSL is interested in working with a commercial collaborator, under the auspices of the Federal Technology Transfer Act, 15 USC 3710a, to transfer this technology to the private sector. There are many potential areas such as emergency response regions, remote military field sites and branch weather forecasting offices within developing countries that could benefit from this technology. FSL will negotiate royalties and licenses for this technology arising from a CRADA partnership or Memorandum of Agreement. The private company or companies forming this partnership with FSL would assist in the research and development of the product and would be responsible for documenting, marketing and maintaining the W4 system networks that would be implemented. This technology will be demonstrated in the NOAA FSL booth (#111) at the AMS Conference and Exhibit to be held in Orlando, FL, during the week of January 14, 2002. Additional technical information has also been published on the W4 web site http://www-id.fsl.noaa.gov. Discussions will be held en mass with all candidate partners regarding the specifics of this new technology to be defined within the CRADA or licensing agreement.
Partner selection criteria will include technical expertise and experience with similar technologies, experience in marketing, past experience in partnering with a government research organization and the resources and funding available to successfully bring this technology to market. Parties interested in scheduling a demonstration at the AMS Conference and Exhibit should contact William B. Bendel at (303) 497-6708, fax: (303) 497-6758, bendel@fsl.noaa.gov or stop by the NOAA FSL booth. The potenti

<DESC>Private firms meeting the basic criteria below are invited to contact either Mr. Dave Miller or Antonio Ceballos at the respective e-mail addresses:  Dave.Miller@mail.doc.gov and Antonio.Ceballos@mail.doc.gov prior to generating any actual partnership proposal or other submission to the Department of Commerce.

The Department of Commerce/International Trade Administration/ U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service (DOC/ITA/US&FCS) seeks to establish public/private partnerships in connection with its buyusa program and website  (http://www.buyusa.com).  Buyusa represents a U.S. DOC service introduced in June of 2001 to provide online exporting assistance and facilitation to U.S. firms, particularly small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SME's).  Internet-based trade contact and information services operate in conjunction with the U.S.&FCS's worldwide network of 100+ domestic and 170+ overseas export and commercial offices, and include selective matchmaking between U.S. firms and overseas trading partners, trade lead generation and management, market intelligence for both U.S. and international companies, online interaction with U.S.&FCS trade specialists globally, and a "virtual catalog" capability to display and describe products and services of U.S. exporters. 

The website is developed and operated via a unique collaboration between the DOC which provides substantive content and exporting solutions, and IBM Corporation which provides e-business and supporting technology solutions.  The buyusa program operates under the U.S.&FCS cost recovery authority; subscription fees for varying levels of service are paid by U.S. participants, and the resulting revenue is shared by the DOC and IBM, and potentially by other buyusa partners located via this notice. Buyusa registration is free to International companies.  

During Government FY-2002 buyusa seeks to expand offerings to both U.S. and International companies, and in so doing will consider proposals from private sector entities engaged in one (1) or more business lines which have clear potential to increase and/or facilitate exporting by U.S. SME's.  Those seeking buyusa program participation must meet the following criteria:

1. identify at least one existing and operational online service or product which benefits  exporting or export-related activities of small-to-medium-sized U.S. businesses. Online capabilities which may meet this criterion include export and trade education, international business intelligence, trade contact location, export logistics and compliance, regulatory or other trade governance information/ services, trade finance, international transaction completion, shipping, payment, currency and language conversion, and the like. 

2. demonstrated sustained operation for at least two(2) full-years and a sustainable business plan and model.

3. suitability for presence on a U.S. Government website, indicating that:

  no criminal or civil violations are on record or charged and pending resolution.

  no debarment or documented unfair trade practices, or charges thereof by a foreign Government, are on record or pending.

  no online offerings or business practices are illegal or inappropriate in the U.S. or foreign countries served by buyusa.com, and

  no clear potential for embarrassment to the U.S. Government exists which might jeopardize the U.S.&FCS mission of promoting U.S. exports abroad.

4. express willingness to offer the online service(s) and/or product(s) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of buyusa.com and of U.S. Government websites generally.

<SUBJECT>B -- Space Based Radar (SBR) Meeting with Industry
<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but a notice that the government will provide informational briefs concerning the Space Based Radar (SBR) Program.   THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE.  

The SBR program is focused on maturing technology and developing an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) system capable of providing Ground Moving Target Identification (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Terrain and Elevation Data (DTED) over a large portion of the Earth on a near-continuous basis.  The system will incorporate battlefield tasking and control of the system to facilitate near real-time availability of SBR products to the theater.  The SBR system will allow military forces a "deep-look" into denied areas of interest, on a non-intrusive basis without risk to personnel or resources.  This can be done in the pre-, during, and post-hostility environments not currently available via existing capabilities. 

Technology maturation, risk reduction, and concept development are essential elements of the SBR program strategy to reach initial launch capability (ILC) by FY10.  Investments in key technology areas are focused to mature technologies leading to component design and demonstration.  Concept development activities will focus on reducing risk, integrating technologies, and demonstrating of a system level concept.  Demonstrations as well as modeling and simulation will facilitate maximization of the operational capabilities of the SBR system.

Specific operational, technical, and architectural requirements are TBD and operational scenarios may be found in the draft SBR CONOPS.  An Industry Day will occur on 16 Jan 02, with check in beginning at 12:00 PM.  The meeting will be held in Building A8 of the Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, CA, and will be open to US citizens only.  This session will consist of opening remarks, at 1:00 PM, from Lt Gen Arnold (SMC/CC) as well as briefs on the program?s acquisition strategy options and technology requirements.  The government may ask interested parties to schedule a second session that would occur at a later date, consisting of face-to-face discussions with the government SBR program team.  Due to possible limitations in space, we request that only limited number of representatives be present from each company.  Beginning on 07 Jan 02, information (including updates, agenda, read-ahead material, maps, and additional details regarding the meeting) may be found at http://www.losangeles.af.mil/SMC/XR/PUBLIC/projects/sbr/index.htm, then following the links for Industry Day material and contractor information.  

Interested parties in the activities mentioned above should direct any administrative questions to the POCs below.  Intent to attend, via registration form on the website, should be submitted no later than 14 Jan 2002. 
Primary POC: 1Lt Ryan Space
Secondary POC: 2Lt Geoffrey Eaton
