<SUBJECT>V -- Resupply Services to McMurdo Station Antarctica
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DACS-USAP-0107
<RESPDATE>013107
<ARCHDATE>02152007
<CONTACT>Patricia Williams, Deputy Chief, Contracts Branch, Phone (703) 292-4596, Fax (703) 292-9140/9141, Email pswillia@nsf.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) is managed by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U.S. Government, pursuant to NSC Memorandum 71 (1971) as reaffirmed in Presidential Memorandum 6646 (1982).  PM6646 states: Every effort shall be made to manage the program in a manner that maximizes the cost effectiveness and return on investment.
    
In meeting its responsibilities, NSF arranges for all USAP logistics support activities, including resupply of the year-round U.S. research station at McMurdo.  

In January 2006, NSF sought information regarding the long-term availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the resupply of the USAP?s McMurdo Station. That RFI can be viewed at: 

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DCCA/CPO/DCCA%2D060024/listing.html

NSF now sees merit in seeking information concerning a complete resupply package (for example, mated icebreakers and cargo/fuel supply vessels that can work in close tow configuration.)  

Background 

NSF is interested in contracting for resupply services to McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  These services would involve annually transporting cargo as specified below to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77 deg 51' S, 166 deg 40' E. NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement of at least ten years. It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60 deg S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks, but the operating period may differ with the type of resupply package that is proposed. After that period the vessels would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

The service would deliver fuel, containers and break bulk to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as well as retrograde of materials from McMurdo Station to the U.S or to an acceptable transfer point.  The nominal current annual requirements are identified below and in the attached spreadsheets. 

Fuel (gallons)
o	AN-8 3.5 million
o	JP-5 3.0 million
o	Gasoline 250 thousand

Cargo Delivered
o	Containers (TEU): 600
o	Break Bulk (Pounds): 1.5 million

Cargo Retrograded
o	500 TEU
o	500,000 lbs break bulk

At present, fuel storage (ullage) in McMurdo is such that delivery of the above fuel quantities must be made each year.  However, the USAP plans to increase the ullage such that skipping one year without re-fueling will be possible.  

The container and break-bulk cargo listed in the attached chart includes a considerable amount of cargo dedicated to the re-building of South Pole Station.  It is expected that the volume of delivery will decrease somewhat in coming years.  NSF would consider a proposal for a smaller ship if it could be demonstrated that a double shuttle from a port in the Southern Ocean could be timely and cost-effective.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to open a channel in the sea ice and then to escort cargo and fuel supply vessels using its POLAR class ships. The cargo and fuel delivery vessels have been ice strengthened vessels chartered by the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  The USCG vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life. The MSC vessels are not configured for close coupling with icebreaking vessels configured with a towing notch.  

It is envisioned under this RFI that the icebreaking capability and the resupply ship(s) are all to be offered as one complete, integrated package under direct contract to NSF. 

Partnering arrangements will be welcomed.  For example, it may be that one partner would supply an icebreaker and another would provide the supply ships.

NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c). 

The United States Antarctic Program 

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported in Antarctica by the United States Government. The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research. For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated. U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research. At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities. The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations. 

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station. McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea. It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail. 

Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station. 

Present Schedule and Operations 

The current plan of operation and schedule is provided for information purposes.  Responses to this RFI are not bound to keep within the current mode of operation; in fact respondents are encouraged to review the current operating plans and schedules and to provide innovative suggestions for changes.  

Respondents are encouraged to review the ?Report of the Office of Polar Programs, Office Advisory Committee, subcommittee on U.S. Antarctic Program resupply? for a review of ship resupply and other innovative resupply issues.  This report may be viewed at:
http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jspcntn_id=104354&org=OPP&from=news

Under the current operations, the USCG icebreaker typically arrives at 60 deg S on or about December 25. Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival). The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required .

The freighter used during the 2005/2006 season was the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m). The tanker used was the LAWRENCE GIANELLA, one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/21.2m). Additional information on these vessels may be found at:

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP. The tanker loads at differing ports each year and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16. It departs on or about January 20 each year. The freighter loads at Port Hueneme, California, and Lyttleton, New Zealand, and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year.  It departs on or about February 11. 

Sea Ice 
The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo. It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  For the past five years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound. Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet. The icebergs have moved out of the area since last year.  It is possible that the coming season's ice could start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods. 
A more extensive review of the sea ice conditions may be read at the RFI issued in January 2006 and referenced in the opening paragraph above.  

Evaluation Information 
Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of the proposed resupply package; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted. 

Except as identified herein, no specific format is required. 
Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an icebreaking/resupply package would be: 

o  System economics
o  Performance
o  Reliability
o  Flexibility
o  Marketability (when not on USAP charter). 

It is highly desirable that the vessels proposed have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any refueling from McMurdo. Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this. 

To read more about the fuel available at McMurdo, please read the January 2006 RFI. 

Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation. Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to January 31, 2007, is requested. 

Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Dr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, Room 755, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.  Submissions and other inquiries may be addressed to Patricia S.

<SUBJECT>--2007 Fort Detrick (Frederick, MD) Vendor Day Calendar- Medical Equipment and Supplies
<DESC>Vendor Day Announcement 	A cooperative venture is being announced by the military service medical logistics agencies located on Fort Detrick in Frederick, MD. The agencies involved are the Defense Medical Standardization Board (DMSB), U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA), t he Naval Medical Logistics Command (NAVMEDLOGCOM), the Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA), and the Air Force Medical Logistics Office (AFMLO). The cooperative venture is a series of dates set aside for vendors of medical equipment and s upplies to display their products to multiple service organizations at one time. This event is referred to as Vendor Day. 	Vendor Day will occur at the dates and times as noted below at the Hotdome on Fort Detrick. Maps will be provided. Only products that pertain to the categories identified will be displayed. Participation will be limited to the first 20 vendors who contact  the identified coordinator for each day, also listed below. Vendors must identify at that time what products they wish to show. Vendors will be limited to a specific area for showcasing their products and will not bring extra shelters to accommodate more items. There will be no formal demonstration times set aside. Interested customers will view products at their leisure within the time allotted for each day, much like at a conference exhibit hall. Participation by a vendor does not in any way constitute a pproval of any product by any service organization and vendors will refrain from advertising as such. Participation by any vendor is solely at the discretion of members of the Vendor Day planning committee, who represent all organizations listed in paragra ph 1. 	The Vendor Day planning committee is responsible for coordinating the dates, times, and venue of each event and communicating information, including any changes, to all participants in a timely manner. The planning committee reserves the right to alter th e schedule as mission and circumstances dictate. The planning committee will reserve the venue and ensure it is ready for each event. Vendors are responsible for bringing everything they require for their displays, to include tables, chairs, easels, laptop s, extension cords, etc. Vendors also need to bring sufficient handouts and other materials as needed. Copying services will not be available on post. Vendors are limited to a power draw of 5 amps per vendor due to an overall limitation at the selected ven ue. Vendors who elect to participate in this event must send a government sales representative. 	The focus of these events is to assist the services medical logistics agencies with strategic market analysis of products and technologies that may be applicable to our austere medical environments. We do not support brick and mortar facilities in the U. S., but rather medical units located on land and ships and in challenging environmental conditions. Below is a photo of one of our hospitals in past operations.  	The dates, times, product categories, and event coordinators are listed below. It should be remembered that products need to be suitable for use in an austere environment with extreme temperature ranges possible. For general questions, you may contact Mr.  Dan Kennedy, Nurse Consultant, Acute Care Division, USAMMA, at Dan.Kennedy@det.amedd.army.mil.   2007 Vendor Day Schedule March: 07 March 2007, 0800-1200 hours 		Intravenous pumps/ fluid warmers/ IV solution infusers 		Litters/ litter carriers/ litter systems  		POC: Dan Kennedy (Dan.Kennedy@det.amedd.army.mil) 	May: 02 May 2007, 0800-1200 hours 		Suction machines 		Airway management, including ET tubes, combitubes, specialty intubation devices and equipment 		POC: LTC Joy Walker (Joy.a.Walker@amedd.army.mil) 	July: 11 July 2007, 0800-1200 hours 		Oxygen generation and oxygen concentration equipment 		Distributor Day  distributors may come and participate with no more than SIX of their top products 		POC: Capt Brandi Ritter (B randi.Ritter@ft-detrick.af.mil) 	September: 05 September 2007, 0800-1200 hours  		Field sinks 		Organizational systems (i.e. shelving) 		Portable biological safety cabinets  		POC: LCDR Sharon West (Sharon.West2@amedd.army.mil) 	November: 07 November 2007, 0800-1200 hours  Medical-surgical consumables Cleaning products, wound/burn care POC: Jan Skadberg (Jan.m.Skadberg@amedd.army.mil)
