<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services, has a requirement for bioengineering services for validating standards for eliminating the presence of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCv) in the influent water of fisheries.  USDA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for these services in accordance with the statement of work attached below.    The solicitation will be issued on or about August 24, 2004.  The solicitation will be posted to this website.  The Government intends to provide the solicitation and all amendments via this web site only.  NOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE SENT TO OFFEROR REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF THE SOLICITATION NOR ANY OF ITS AMENDMENTS.  IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THIS WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES.  

Statement of Work:

Bioengineering Services for Validating Standards for Eliminating the Presence of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv) in the Influent Water of Fisheries


Background
Spring Viremia of Carp virus (SVCv) was identified at Blue Ridge Fish Hatchery, Inc. (BRFH) in the spring of 2002.  On July 8, 2003 a compliance agreement was established between BRFH and USDA, APHIS, VS for the eradication of SVCv from BRFH premises.  This agreement included an Action Plan establishing the procedures to be implemented at BRFH facilities for removal of susceptible species, cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipment, replacing water, and restocking.  Since that time, USDA, APHIS, VS has conducted activities to remove susceptible species and clean and disinfect premises and equipment.  BRFH and USDA, APHIS, VS are currently in the process of carrying out the procedures necessary for replacing water and restocking.  One of the requirements in these procedures is that influent water must be from an approved source.  Approved sources are bore hole water, well water, first use spring water, or surface water treated to USDA, APHIS, VS standards and approved by USDA, APHIS, VS.  BRFH has chosen to use treated surface water to fill the ponds.

APHIS set forth general guidelines in the Action Plan that BRFH must adhere to in order to qualify their systems as approved water sources.  Among these, is a requirement that the systems be validated.  Proper validation of the systems by a technical expert will insure APHIS that the systems are set up appropriately to meet APHIS guidelines for reducing or eliminating pathogen load in influent water.  This validation of the systems set up at BRFH is currently underway.

APHIS is now ready to pursue a larger validation project related to the use of sand filtration and UV treatment to eliminate pathogens, such as SVCv, from potentially contaminated surface waters.

Objectives
Validation of the use of sand filtration and UV treatment, as prescribed by APHIS in the “Protocol for Management of Incidences of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV),” to eliminate pathogens, such as SVCv, from potentially contaminated surface waters.  This validation will improve the ability of APHIS to offer this method of obtaining influent water to other fisheries interested in using SVCv free water sources.  The ability to use this type of system could be important to many fisheries interested in certifying stock for sales and for any fisheries that might be involved in a post-infection clean-up plan in the future.  This validation would also enhance APHIS activities regarding setting forth program standards for an SVC Control and Eradication Program in the United States.

Scope
The technical specialists provided by the contractor would identify references on the reduction of SVCv in water using UV treatment systems and compare information from those references to the current standards outlined by APHIS; assist in the development or procurement of a water test for presence of SVCv; develop a protocol for using a water test for SVCv to determine the efficacy of water treatment systems; and make recommendations regarding water treatment standards that must be met to insure elimination of SVCv from influent waters.  The contractor would provide written reports detailing the findings at each stage of the project.  

Any references identified regarding the reduction of SVCv in water using UV treatment systems will be provided to APHIS in full text. In addition, a report detailing the comparison of information from those references to the current standards outlined by APHIS will be prepared and provided to APHIS.

Any currently available water test for the presence of SVCv, will be evaluated and a written report on the applicability of such test will be completed.  If a currently available test, which meets the needs of APHIS for evaluating the UV water treatment systems, is identified, the contractor will also identify, in writing, sources for procurement of that test.  If no currently available test is determined to be able to meet the needs of APHIS for evaluating the UV water treatment systems, the contractor will assist in the development of a water test for presence of SVCv which can be used for evaluation the UV water treatment systems.  This assistance might include providing APHIS with written reports detailing the components needed for such a test and their assembly and use to create such a test.  It might also include development and testing of a “prototype” test.

Once a suitable water test has been identified or developed, the contractor will develop a protocol for using the water test for SVCv to determine the efficacy of water treatment systems.  This protocol will detail the proper use of the test from water collection to interpretation of results.

The contractor will use the test and protocol set out to test systems installed to APHIS UV water treatment standards and will make written recommendations regarding water treatment standards that must be met to insure elimination of SVCv from influent waters.

The contractor will provide written reports with supportive scientific documentation in response to questions and concerns, from APHIS, relating to this validation program.

Requirements
The objective of awarding this contract is to provide technical specialists to assist APHIS in validating water treatment guidelines to be used to insure SVCv-free water sources for fisheries.  These specialists are expected to be able to effectively perform all tasks necessary for complete validation of water treatment systems for the elimination of SVCv from surface water sources.

Selection Criteria
The agency needs experts in water treatment systems and use of these systems in an aquaculture setting.  The qualifications necessary to perform the validation of the influent water treatment process for SVCv include knowledge of aquaculture, fisheries biology, fisheries bioengineering, fish health, biosecurity, influent water treatment systems, filtration processes for solids removal, disinfection processes for pathogen reduction, and testing processes for viral pathogens.  Qualifications should also include experience in the design of solids removal and disinfection systems for influent/effluent hatchery water treatment.  Design expertise should be demonstrated in completed projects that utilize solids removal followed by ultraviolet irradiation for the exclusion of pathogens into or containment of pathogens out of aquaculture facilities.  

Deliverables
Contractor shall, upon request, be available for consultation within 48 hours to provide scientific advice and oversight.  Contractor shall provide written reports and documentations as needed to include written reports detailing the findings at each stage of the project, as outlined above. Written reports indicating progress and current status will be completed at least quarterly.  

Government-furnished equipment and Government-furnished information
Contractor will be furnished with the APHIS protocol for Management of Incidences of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv), the Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCv) Action Plan for Blue Ridge Fish Hatchery, Inc. (BRFH) Farm Locations, and other information about APHIS operations in relation to SVCv as needed to perform the validation work.

Security
Contractor will have limited availability to data via specified e-mail.  Contractor will not have access to USDA, APHIS, VS private files or databases.

Place of Performance
Contractor work will be performed primarily from the office site of the contractor and on-site at locations with installed UV water treatment systems for surface waters used to fill fisheries.  APHIS, prior to work being conducted at such sites, must approve other sites identified as necessary to perform all stages of the validation process by the contractor.

Period of Performance
This contract shall be in place for the period of approximately one year or until validation of APHIS standards for water treatment of surface waters for use as SVCv-free water sources is completed.  Both parties may amend the contract at such time deemed necessary by mutual agreement in writing.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement to establish a Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC).  The NIAID places a high priority on integrating advanced computer and engineering technologies into its core research activities and strives to make scientific data widely useful and readily available to the clinical and basic science research community. With that in mind, the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract will provide information technology support in the production, analysis, curation, archiving, and exchange of genomic and proteomic data, as well as other basic scientific and clinical data. This contract will support a diverse community of clinical and basic researchers, engaged in the investigation of immune-mediate diseases.  It will enable scientists to easily access, generate and exchange complex data sets of high quality with the assurance that these data are portable, interoperable, and survivable over time.  Services to be performed by the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contractor(s) include: (1) conducting a requirements assessment of bioinformatics needs in a diverse community of basic and clinical researchers; (2) prototyping a system for the collection, storage, and query of data;  (3) designing, implementing and maintaining a data warehouse of genomic, proteomic and other related data relevant to the research of these programs; (4) providing technical assistance to participating centers in the selection of technologies for the capture, storage, query, and analysis of these data, and, (5) measuring performance and benefits resulting from these technical support activities and planning for their appropriate development and use in the future. 

This project will occur in two phases.  Phase I will include the completion of a systems analysis and requirements assessment resulting in a working prototype of a system for distributed scientific data management.  Phase II will involve the full-scale implementation and operation of the bioinformatics integration support system conceived and approved under the Phase I contract.  Phase I will result in multiple awards and encompass an 18-month period of performance.  At the completion of Phase I, each Phase I Contractor will submit a proposal (in both written and oral presentation forms) along with their prototype to perform Phase II of the project.  These proposals will be reviewed by members of the original NIH peer review group.  It is anticipated that only one (1) Phase II contract will be awarded for a period of six (6) years.  Phase I is expected to begin on/about September 30, 2002.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   This is a notice of intent, only, not a request for quote. The Office of Research and Development (ORD) intends to award a sole source contract to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA for Microsoft Premier Support.  The ORD requirement is for Microsoft Tier 3 support to  provide technical guidance and troubleshooting for the ORD standard desktop and server images and various Microsoft management software applications in use throughout the country.  Since Microsoft applications are used throughout ORD (Desktop, Servers, Office Suite and Management Software) only  Microsoft Premier Support can provide direct access to Microsoft Tier 3 software developers and proprietary source code for current and future products on a 7 by 24 basis.  The ORD Call Center and ORD Network Operations Center require such resources to support the ORD user base of 3500 users, 5000  workstations and 300 servers.  Purchasing support from another vendor would not be cost or time effective and would not gain ORD access to the vast Microsoft Tier 3 knowledge base needed to support ORD on a 7 by 24 basis. ORD will be able to call a special 800 number, 50 times during the next FY,  and receive dedicated Microsoft Technical Account Manager (TAM) attention and coordination from and with Microsoft developers, programmers and security staff.  These Microsoft virtual technical teams will work to solve Tier 3 level issues to successful completion.  The Microsoft TAM will spend up  to 400 hours dedicated to ORD Tier 3 support coordination with these Microsoft virtual teams and visit ORD HQ at least once during the FY. This noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency  requirements).  ORD plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, Premier Sales, 2118 Water Ridge Parkway, Charlotte, NC  28217.  The agreement with Microsoft will provide for  specialized technical Tier 3 assistance, 7 by 24 toll free hot line availability based on individual incident calls.  This agreement will provide ORD with proactive, organizational support services which are aimed at providing rapid resolution to ORD enterprise support issues during the twelve (12)  month period of performance.  This Basic Premier Support Service agreement shall include 50 individual incidents calls, 400 hours of Technical Account Management, and a site visit by the assigned Microsoft Technical Account Manager (TAM).  This announcement constitutes the RFP and is the only  solicitation that will be issued. Written responses must be submitted via e-mail only to: redmon-johnson.iris@epamail.epa.gov, by 4:00 PM, EST on September 30, 2004.  Telephone inquiires will not be accepted. Please include your name, address, area code and telephone/fax number, business class and  indicated whether pricing is GSA/FSS or open market.

          For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,
          which includes either depot (DLA-direct) or DVD (customer-
          direct) shipments, both DoD linear and 2-D bar code markings

          MIL-STD-129, revision P, dated December 15, 2002.  2-D bar
          coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC
          15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3) and DoD 4500.9-R.  MSL linear (code 3
          of 9 or code 39) bar coding shall be in accordance with
          ISO/IEC 16388.  MSL label stock quality shall meet
          MIL-PRF-61002.  MSL bar code print quality shall meet ANSI
          MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000) for applicable 2-D

          required to be bar-coded, the field shall be zero-filled.
          These requirements do not apply to delivery orders when the

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command intends to solicit a proposal for research and development services in the area of laser-protected combat vision systems. The current generation of weapon systems is vulnerable to lasers th at may be used to blind both human operators and electronic imaging systems.  Lasers are now extensively used on the battlefield. Today, they are chiefly employed as range-finding and targeting devices. However, as they have grown in power, ruggedness and portability, the possibility of using them as weapons in themselves is emergin g. A laser of sufficient power, directed at the periscopes or vision blocks of a combat vehicle, may temporarily or permanently impair the vision of the operator. It may have similar effects on electronic imaging systems. Ordinarily, lasers produce light a t a single wavelength or color. Such lasers can potentially be thwarted by using filters created to block that specific wavelength. However, if the attacking wavelength is not known in advance, this approach is not useful. Also, if multiple wavelengths are  used, it becomes increasingly difficult to block them all, especially in a way that will not impair the performance of the vision device. There is now an emerging threat from agile lasers. They are called agile because of their ability to produce many  wavelengths, and they will defeat a single wavelength defense. The Army wants a solution to this problem that will work against the whole spectrum of laser threats. This contract will provide for the development of energy-dependent laser protection materials and devices.  An energy-dependent device protects operators and systems by limiting the amount of energy they transmit, not by blocking specific wavelengths.  S uch devices are described as non-linear. A normal optical device transmits energy in a linear way: under low-light conditions, it transmits low light, and under bright light it transmits bright light. A non-linear device transmits nearly all of the light  it receives under normal conditions, but stops transmitting light if it is dangerously intense.   One of the key requirements is that the device needs an extremely short reaction time. Beyond that, there are all of the usual constraints for combat vehicles, including ruggedness, compactness, weight, survivability, and cost. This effort requires technic al specialists in the areas of nonlinear optical materials development and testing, laser weapons device technologies, human vision and human factors, optical vision system design, fabrication and testing, laser laboratory measurement techniques, electrica l engineering and assembly, mechanical engineering, drawing and fabrication, and laser/material interaction effects and measurements. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded without competition to the Boeing Company of St. Louis, MO.   The contract may extend up to five years.  A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated. The estimated release date of the request for proposals  is 15 October 2004, closing 29 November 2004. Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>Event Planning and Registration Software Request for Information This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The US Army is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its requirements research for an events planning and registration product. The capabilities feedback will assist in the acquisition of an event planning and registration web-enabled application.  These functions are now fragmented throughout the Army with the use of both duplicative automated tools as well as time consuming manua l methods.   The event planning software will require integration with the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) portal through a URL re-direct or hosting. The consolidation of this capability will result in more efficient event management as well as realize signifi cant time savings across the Army. BACKGROUND:  The Army plans and executes many events throughout the year with each organization or Command using manual methods as well as customized event planning and registration tools.  These events include conferences with track and sessions as well a s social events such as the Army Birthday Ball.   The events can vary from 200 to 3000 attendees.  The complexity of managing events has resulted in tool solutions that do not scale nor meet the enterprise capability requirements.    The US Army CIO/G-6 requests information on an enterprise4 (as defined in enclosure 2) events planning and registration software tool.  The events planning software must integrate with the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) portal through URL re-direct or hosting .  The architectural scope paragraph outlines minimum application interface requirements. AKO is the Armys enterprise portal that provides universal, secure, access, 24/7/365, worldwide.  Access through AKO ensures the security of all event information an d authentication of the prospective attendees.   ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:  The objective of this information request is to obtain research on an enterprise product that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides event planning and registration capabilities to the Army military and civilian employ ees utilizing AKOs authentication functionality. As such, the primary objectives of this capability acquisition are to: a.	Receive a solution that produces a seamless/transparent event planning and registration application that includes the capability requirements as listed in enclosure 1.   b.	Receive a solution that is a robust and user friendly, enterprise Commercial-Off-the-Shelf toolset that delivers best of breed conference and event planning software for registration, payment options, attendee special needs, and event reports to include  event data archiving.  c.	Ensure security compliance and information assurance for the application through integration with AKO. ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIALS: Event planning and registration software has unique requirements that vary by scale and type of conference, etc.  To clarify Army information needs, the following is provided: ·	Minimum capabilities are established and listed at enclosure 1.  ·	Definitions for the capabilities and the types of licenses available in the events planning industry vary. Definitions are provided at enclosure 2 to clarify the Army product acquisition meaning. Terms with definitions will have a corresponding superscri pt number. CAPABILITIES ACQUISITION ISSUES:   SCOPE:  The event planning and registration software must scale to a minimum of 3000 registrants (attendees) per event with the capacity to handle all registration and planning responsibilities for concurrent events.  For larger conferences, the event soft ware must have the capability of 200 concurrent attendee1 online registrations without a time-out or a mandatory drop from the system. The vendor must have online web registration with end-to-end processing4 and seamless interfaces to all mandatory modules  to include financial, track/session planning, and event reporting. The end-to-end processing includes intuitive, user-friendly links and menu drop boxes that takes the registrant from initial entry into the event planning tool through registration, payment, seating preferences, special needs, hotel arrang ements to final conference/event feedback and financial audit.  Individual conference/event changes to the end-to-end processing can be accomplished by the Army proponent organization for the event. The web-enabled software will not require a thin-client interface for the core administrative team in order to access administrative planning tasks, event reports, etc.  An enterprise license will be defined by the industry vendor and will include attendee s as defined in enclosure 2. The scope includes software operation and maintenance, URL re-direct with AKO including connectivity maintenance, software upgrade delivery during the life of the contract,  Army-wide customer assistance to the event(s) core te am, and training, as required.  Services shall be available 24 hours, 7 days a week, during the time that the event(s) are ongoing.    			(Reference: Definitions enclosure 2) SECURITY:  For the security of all events and the data implicit in an event planning and registration application, the vendor must utilize user authentication and user attribute lookup through the AKO.  Authentication includes user attributes such as e-mai l address, first and last name, and SSN. The AKO Directory provides Enterprise Directory Services for Army web applications. Directory services include user authentication currently via user id and password, and user attribute lookup for unrestricted attri butes such as e-mail address, first name (GIVENNAME) and last name (SN). The AKO Directory also provides secured access for lookup of restricted user attributes such as SSN. A URL re-direct can offer this secure authentication as well as AKO hosting.  All Army security certification requirements must be met by the offerer.  The software must secure the attendees information, to include financial, through 128-bit encryption wit h authorized connection to Verisign for financial transactions5. For further technical information, the AKO technical POC is Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Blakely, (COML) 703-704-3363, kenneth.blakely@us.army.mil.

<DESC>ANTICIPATED RELEASE (7 OCT 04) OF RFP FOR THE MCGUIRE AFB/FORT DIX, NJ, MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING PRIVATIZATION PROJECT.  THE INDUSTRY FORUM HAS ALREADY BEEN HELD. 

Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) and the Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at McGuire Air Force Base (AFB) and Fort Dix, NJ on or about 7 October 2004.  Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the McGuire AFB and Fort Dix project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the McGuire AFB and Fort Dix project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.  The McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Housing Privatization Project will be initiated with a real estate transaction. The objective of the transaction is to provide quality homes for Military Families and management of a 2,345-unit housing community for a period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,364 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will be conveyed to the SO.  The Government may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the McGuire AFB and Fort Dix family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

R-Implementing Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis of L2C Deployment- 
U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Irving Leveson using simplified acquisition procedures for consulting services to conduct the study: GPS Modernization: A Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis of L2C Deployment and Reflecting L5 deployment.  NOAA has a requirement, as identified in Program Guidance memoranda, to immediately implement this program. The effort will be carried out under the Office of the Chief Economist. The effort will incorporate scenarios for deployment of satellites and signals and for strength and speed of demand for GPS, L2C and applications as a function of technical characteristics and capabilities of L1, L2, L2C, L5, developments in technology; substitution effects against dual frequency coded L1 C/A & L2C use vs. L1/L2 codeless/semi-codeless use and for L2C use vs. L1 C/A single frequency use, market segment characteristics, and market penetration paths; assessment of competition and reinforcement between RNSS systems as a function of technical compatibility and market strategy, and between RNSS and ground-based systems,; benefit valuation and cost measurement, scenario-based analysis of  risks and benefit trade-offs among civilian and military uses with alternative L2C deployments, controlling for deployment of GPS IIRMs and M-Code UE; roles of GPS in a GNSS; and strategic quantitative and qualitative analysis of policy alternatives as a function of scenarios and risks. 

The contractor will be responsible for developing the substance of the analysis and preparing reports and presentations. Contractor will conduct analyses of technology, demand and competition, incremental value of benefits, costs, risks, integrative scenarios and strategic alternatives.  He will work with agencies, knowledgeable individuals, information and data sources, conduct interviews with industry users, synthesize economic and market literature, perform quantitative and a qualitative analyses, prepare reports and make presentations to the IGEB. The effort includes working with NOAA personnel, working with IGEB and its component agencies and coordinating with other government and external studies of L2C and L5.

The objective of the effort is to provide policy-makers in IGEB and component and oversight agencies with recommendations as to timing, sequencing and number of satellites providing L2C signals and strategies for L2C in relation to competing systems, military considerations and role of GPS in a GNSS, taking account benefits, costs, risks and viable strategic alternatives. Critical issues cover a complex and diverse set of subject areas that must be integrated in a strategic analysis that incorporates experienced judgment. The initial phase will test and refine the methodology and work plan and provide guidance as to achievable results and their contribution to decision-making.

Unique Qualifications

The proposed contractor has unique qualifications to perform the range of tasks involved in this contract.  A Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University, he has over 30 years experience as a consultant and employee in private industry, non-partisan think tanks, and government.

He served as Director of Economic Studies for the Hudson Institute, interfacing with political, social and national security study teams, and as Senior Vice President and Director of Research of Hudson Strategy Group. He has consulted to major corporations such as CitiGroup, Horizon Blue Cross-Blue Shield, the New York Stock Exchange and entrepreneurial companies on analysis of markets, competition, risks, technology impacts and forecasting, geopolitical issues and business strategies, and participated on teams modeling costs, benefits and risks at the Center for Adaptive Systems Applications.  His government clients include the CIA, NSA, Department of State, SBA, HHS, and the Department of Commerce, with advice on strategic planning, financial analysis, business model development, U.S. and international economic development, science and engineering human resources and long-range trend analysis. 

Dr. Leveson’s has been working with NOAA on application of economic and strategic planning concepts and tools to decision-making and management, notably in the areas of cost-benefit analysis, business and economic trends and evolving business models in the private and public sector such as the provision of weather and climate forecasts and information, evolutionary technology such as the internet, Web services, and electronic commerce; research and development trends and public/private sector interfaces, including climate and satellites, and environmental and natural resource management issues. As such, Dr. Leveson has developed wide-ranging familiarity with NOAA mandates, programs, organization, decision-making processes and directions. He was Principal Investigator of the September 2002 trend analysis that contributed to the development of NOAA’s strategic plan and provided focused assistance on special issues such as technology and ocean issues. He has been assisting NOAA in integrating economics and social sciences into its planning and decision-making and developing analysis of critical issues.

<DESC>Sources Sought to provide COTS software for a Learning Management System

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is issuing a Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis to seek qualified sources capable of supplying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software for a Learning Management System.  This procurement will implement the USPTO 21st Century Strategic Plan initiative calling for a certification program to ensure that the U.S. Patent and Trademark employees have the knowledge, skills, and ability to support USPTO goals. The procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) which is available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/. Under PTAG, the USPTO is authorized to limit the number of offerors to achieve maximum reasonable competition. Upon review of the responses to this Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis and if the USPTO determines that it is in the best interests of the USPTO to proceed with an open market acquisition, the USPTO will utilize a two-step streamlined acquisition approach in accordance with PTAG.  Step 1:  Review Capability Statements and downselect to no more than 5 most highly qualified vendors. Step 2:  Issue RFP to the vendors selected from Step 1 and award to the offeror providing the best value. Those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised. USPTO may elect to request product demonstrations as part of the follow-on technical evaluation. USPTO may also elect, in accordance with the PTAG, to negotiate only with the most highly rated vendor in Step 2.   THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED.  IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR STEP 2, INTERESTED VENDORS MUST RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  

The USPTO is currently investigating training strategies and establishing USPTO training policies that comply and reflect the President’s Management Agenda, personnel statutes, executive orders, judicial precedents, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Department of Commerce (DOC) decisions and directives and USPTO personnel management decisions and directives to design and develop guidelines, systems, and standards for employee career development, training, and occupational career management. 

The technical requirements of the Learning Management System are outlined in Attachment A.

Interested vendors shall submit a capability statement, not to exceed 50 pages that demonstrates the offeror’s qualifications and capability to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements which are outlined in Attachment A.   The capability statement should address the following:  (1) past performance, (2) technical capability and (3) price.  

In determining past performance vendors shall provide customer points of contact, description of the requirement, cost, performance accomplishments and references. In determining technical capability USPTO may test and technically evaluate the proposed systems based on the following factors: security (data encryption and integrity), proven implementation, ease of maintenance, scalability, performance, high availability, component reusability, and compatibility with USPTO architecture.  Specify if software can integrate with IBM WebSphere.  Include benchmarks for each platform supported, including concurrent user statistics, if available.  Multiple approaches are welcomed.  In determining price, vendors will submit price schedules. Ultimate vendor selection will be based upon Best Value as follows: technical and past performance when combined is more important than price.  

Prospective offerors must respond to this Pre-solicitation announcement in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  Capability statements shall be submitted electronically via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format to hope.smith@uspto.gov no later than September 30, 2004 at 5:00pm.   The USPTO will confirm receipt of all submissions.  Late submissions will not be accepted.

P/N: L54463135050
NSN: 6150-01-220-2690EK
Best Estimated Quantity = 18

 This amendment is issued to clarify the required quantity, to add several notes, to delete a clause, and to extend the solicitation closing date as follows:
 
1.  For clarification purposes, potential offerors should be aware that this effort contemplates the award of a three-year Requirements contract as defined under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.503.  As such, the solicitation states a realistic estimated total quantity (Best Estimated Quantity – BEQ) for the total three-year ordering period.  However, this estimate is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered.  As provided under FAR 16.503(a) (2), the solicitation also provides minimum and maximum order quantities that the Government may order under each individual order and a maximum contract quantity that it may order during the three-year ordering period.
 
 
2.  As a result of Provision 1 above, the BEQ, minimum order quantity, maximum order quantity, and maximum contract quantity are clarified as follows:
 
Best Estimated Quantity:  18 each
Maximum Order Quantity:  12 each
Minimum Order Quantity:  2 each
Maximum Contract Quantity:  27 each
 
The Minimum Contract Quantity, by definition of a Requirements contract, would be 0.
 
 
3.  The following Notes are hereby incorporated into the solicitation:
 
NOTE 1:  Offers as to price are to be made only for the Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ).  Offers for maximum order quantity, minimum order quantity, or maximum contract quantity are not to be made, and if made, will be disregarded.  Evaluation of award will be based on the proposed unit price for the BEQ and those provisions as set out in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award, of Part IV – Representations and Instructions, of the solicitation.  Special attention is also directed to provisions of Section I, Contract Clauses, of Part II – Contract Clauses, hereof entitled “Ordering,” “Order Limitations,” and “Requirements.”
 
NOTE 2:  Any resultant contract shall be in effect from the effective date of the contract through a three-year period or until the maximum contract quantity is exhausted, whichever comes first, unless the provisions of the clause “Option to Extend Ordering Period and Increase Qty” under Section H, Special Contract Requirements, of Part I – The Schedule, are exercised.
 
NOTE 3:  Any delivery schedules bid or proposed as “After Receipt of Order (ARO)” will be converted to calendar dates (ARO months X 30 + 10 days/ARO weeks X 7 + 10 days/ARO days + 10 days = calendar date of delivery) at time of award.
 
NOTE 4:  Sections K, L, and M of Part IV – Representations and Instructions should be returned with any proposal. 
 
 
4.  The “Inspection/Acceptance Report” required under Item 0001 of Part I – The Schedule, Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs is hereby changed as follows to reflect the transition to Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) for delivery reporting.
 
	FROM:
 
	Inspection/Acceptance Report:  DD250 Required
 
	TO:
 
	Inspection/Acceptance Report:  WAWF (See DFARS 252.232-7003)
 
 
5.  As a result of Provision 4, Clause 9952.246-9000, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (OMB No. 0704-0248)(JALC), under Section E, Inspection and Acceptance, of Part I – The Schedule, is deleted in its entirety.
 
 
6.  As a result of Provisions 1 – 5, the solicitation closing date shown in Block 9 of Page 1 is revised as follows:
 
	FROM:	23 AUG 2004 4:00PM
 
	TO:	13 SEP 2004 4:00PM 
 
7.	Offerors submitting a proposal should return a copy of this amendment to acknowledge their understanding of the changes.

<CONTACT>Carol A. Brown brownca@navsea.navy.mil 202-781-4875
<DESC>The Navy is interested in gathering information on the availability of equipment, systems, and approaches that will provide both short-term and long-term solutions to the current Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection (AT/FP) gaps and inefficiencies associated with self-protection of “afloat” assets by providing a Shipboard Protection System (SPS) to all Naval vessels (minus submarines, but including MSC ships).  PMS 480, the Anti-Terrorism Afloat Program Office within PEO Littoral and Mine Warfare, has been tasked to function as the Navy’s responsible acquisition activity for all Shipboard and Expeditionary AT/FP initiatives, and will manage any contractual effort associated with providing this SPS capability to the fleet. Vision / Objective System.  To ensure / enhance the ability for Naval vessels to accomplish self-protection while moored to a pier, at anchor, or during restricted maneuvering, the Navy requires a fully integrated and seamless sensor, analysis, and response system that will provide the means for 360o situational awareness (SA) associated with and to counter asymmetric AT/FP threats around-the-clock with no increase in manning.  The operational concept for the initial and objective systems will provide a flexible layered defense with situational awareness, deterrence, and engagement zones being defined by the system operator.  This system should be modular and expandable and should support installation / operation on multiple ship classes / platforms within the Navy.  The initial increment of this system must immediately provide the ability to support standalone operations for a single vessel and must be designed to ultimately be integrated with / within multi-ship and/or sho! re side AT/FP envelopes.  This capability must be available, operable, and supportable in both overseas and continental U.S. ports and waterways.  This capability will provide surveillance, detection, identification, tracking, deterrence, engagement, and command & control functions for both own-ship and own-ship deployable assets that can be applied to appropriately counter surface, subsurface, and airborne threats.   Initial System Requirements.  The initial “standalone” system will be applied to multiple ship classes and will focus on dealing with / countering surface threats.  This initial system will include a common core Command & Control (C2) application / capability, shipboard sensors, and engagement means.   This capability should be designed as an “open architecture”, net-centric compliant application that is capable of: 1.	Controlling (ideally automatically/remotely) shipboard sensors and lethal & non-lethal engagement assets (e.g., electro-optics, hailing devices, guns, etc.) that will provide 360o coverage against surface threats from the waterline out (where practical), 2.	Receiving data feeds and interoperating with the surface search radars and other intelligence inputs,  3.	Generating, displaying, and using SA overlays (that can be shared with patrol boats launched from own-ship), 4.	Providing automated features and decision aid tools that will assist the operator and watch officer in defending their ship.     5.	Functioning as a “plug & play” host for current and future capabilities,  6.	Being eventually integrated with other existent C2 applications / the ship’s combat system. Call for Information.  This RFI requests the nomination of approaches, ideas, applications, and equipment that could function, when assembled and integrated, as the core C2 application and major subcomponents of SPS.  Additionally, request input on what the nominal installation set would be and request your notional timeline and cost parameters on what it would take to developed/manufacture/integrate/install your proposed solution set.  All inputs received will aid the government in understanding the appropriate mix of technologies available and the acquisition approach the government will take.  An SD&D RFP (with manufacturing options) may be developed and released as a result of inputs received.

<SOLNBR>N6133104QMH01
<RESPDATE>102804
<CONTACT>Mary Hines at 850-235-5389, or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City is seeking sources to develop a piece of support equipment to handle and maintain the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM )Tow Cable.  This capability will be necessary on board large ships as well as land based support activities.  It  will be referred to here as the OAMCM Tow Cable Maintenance and Handling Device (OTCMHD). The CSTRS (Carriage Stream Tow & Recovery System) handling system, including the OAMCM Winch, was developed based on the Tow Cable that was specifically developed for use with the AN/AQS-20A towed sonar system on the MH-60S helicopter.  Still, the intent is to have a common tow cable for the three OAMCM systems that will require it (AN/AQS-20A, OASIS, and AMNS).  Currently, the “Common Tow Cable” (OAMCM Tow Cable) is the one designed for the OASIS system.  It is assumed that any modifications to the Tow Cable, for the AMNS and OASIS systems, will not affect the interface of the cable to the OTCMHD. OTCMHD Requirements 1.Shall be used with the OAMCM Winch to remove, install, inspect, maintain, and possibly transfer the OAMCM Tow Cable to a storage drum. 2.Shall be primarily operated with the OAMCM Winch when removed from the helicopter; however, it shall not preclude operation with the OAMCM Winch and the CSTRS Q20 Kit installed on the helicopter.  3.Capable of handling the OAMCM Common Tow Cable without damage to the cable.  Characteristics of the cable are as follows: a.0.51 inch cable cross section.  Torque balanced. b.Minimum bend diameter of 16 inches on the hard plastic faired section. c.Minimum bend diameter of 16 inches on the bare armored section. d.The OAMCM Tow Cable has a variable cross section including hard plastic fairings, ribbon fairing, tow and carriage stops. e.Large molded fairing that is part of wet end mechanical termination. f.Wet and dry end electrical and fiber optics terminations require careful handling. 4.Capable of interfacing with the OAMCM Winch mechanical support structure  a.Shall provide a means to securely mount the OAMCM winch after it is removed from the helicopter. b.OAMCM Winch drum cannot be removed  5.Shall minimize the Manpower required to handle the OAMCM Tow Cable. 6.Shall minimize the operating space required, including the space between OAMCM Winch and OTCMHD, during OAMCM Tow Cable transfer. 7.Shall minimize the amount of space required for its storage. 8.Maintenance concept shall consider three levels of maintenance (Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot).   Recommended levels of maintenance will be determined by the Level of Repair Analysis (LORA).   9.Design shall minimize the need for Peculiar Support Equipment. 10.The size, shape, and other features shall be designed to facilitate transportation and operation afloat and ashore. 11.The OTCMHD, or any auxiliary equipment required with it, shall fulfill the requirements of the OAMCM Winch hydraulic system, (Space required for Auxiliary Equipment will count towards required operating space).  The OAMCM Winch hydraulic system requirements are: a.3000 PSI pressure compensated pump and 13 GPM b.Mil-PRF-83282 hydraulic fluid c.3 micron filter  d.Test port for hydraulic fluid e.Pressure and Flow Rate Gages 12.Shall be capable of applying constant tension during installation of the OAMCM Tow Cable on the OAMCM Winch (variable up to around 300 lbs). 13.Application of constant cable tension is preferred during OAMCM Tow Cable removal from the OAMCM Winch.

<DESC>This is an invitation to Pre-Qualify, not a request for proposal (RFP).  The U. S. Postal Service, in anticipation of issuing a solicitation for Hazardous and Regulated Waste Management Services (HRWM) on a national basis is seeking to pre-qualify a limited number of suppliers.  The USPS intends to award a contract to one or more suppliers who will provide the USPS with (HRWM) services, consisting of waste pick-up, transportation, spill response, labeling, profiling, manifest preparation, sampling, characterization, documentation of final disposition (treatment, storage, and disposal) and recycling of hazardous/regulated wastes.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) has the potential to generate federal hazardous waste as defined under RCRA, as well as other regulated waste at approximately 750 facilities nationwide.  The supplier must have the technical, logistical, and financial resources available to administer a contract of this magnitude.  They must currently have the distribution network, product offering and EDI expertise to satisfy all USPS requirements for HRWM services on a national level.  Service must be available to all locations within the 48 contiguous United States (CONUS), as well as, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (OCONUS).  This contract will also require suppliers to design and implement cost reduction processes throughout the supply chain, applying the principles of Supply Chain Management (SCM).  The preferred method of doing business will be to utilize electronic data interchange (EDI) through the USPS internal web-based purchasing  system, eBuy.  The supplier must provide and maintain a hard copy, and an electronic catalog.  Orders placed through eBuy will be passed electronically to the supplier.  Invoicing and payment will also be accomplished via EDI, utilizing a unique, postal provided, customer delivery address (FEDSTRIP) number.  As all postal buyers do not have internet access, the supplier will also be required to provide traditional ordering methods including telephone, fax, and US Mail.  Suppliers will be required to submit quarterly reports and to provide and coordinate all customer service training.  The contracts will also require suppliers, if not small businesses themselves, to provide a sub-contracting plan that addresses sub-contracting with small, minority, and woman-owned businesses.  Suppliers seeking placement on the pre-qualified list must demonstrate that they possess the financial, technical, organizational, and managerial resources, and have the experience, operational capability, and quality assurance programs necessary to perform a national contract of this size and scope.  The closing date for Sources Sought for this initiative is October 29, 2004.  No Invitations to pre-qualify will be accepted after this date.  All interested parties are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is currently seeking potential sources, large or small businesses, which are capable of demonstrating at a minimum Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capabilities for Sea Viking 2006, an advanced Warfighting experiment.  Respondents must demonstrate at a minimum that they can provide the following UAV capabilities: Surveillance and Reconnaissance: visual imagery capable of detecting/identifying/locating (better than 100M accuracy) tactical elements of threat forces; Range: 150NM; Endurance:  6-8 hours; Launch/Recovery: Able to launch and recover by MEU forces operating ashore; Responsiveness: Able to respond to unplanned RSTA missions (quick set-up, mission programming, and launch process); Retaskable: Able to be retasked while in flight; Communication/Data Link: and Communicate and display imagery to the seabased command post with no ground infrastructure.  Other UAV capability objectives include (but not limited to) the ability to communicate and display imagery to forces ashore simultaneously with the seabased command post, to launch and recover from amphibious ships, to image the targeted area from 10,000 feet AGL or above, and to provide target designation.   Participation in Sea Viking 2006 could involve six days of 24-hour operations for each of the Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs) and the Limited Objective Experiment (LOE).  The tentative time periods for the LTAs and the LOE are below: UAV LTA, 1 September 2005; UAV LTA, 2 December 2005; and ISR LOE, March 2006.  The UAV system will pose as a surrogate for a future Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) UAV capable of seabased operations.  The UAV system must be capable of conducting its mission without relying on any ground infrastructure. The Government will use responses from this Sources Sought Synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals nor will a contract follow as a result of this announcement.  Therefore, this synopsis must not be construed as a commitment by the government.

The instrument is a 4-power, fixed-focus telescope with a 10-degree field of v iew.  It is mounted on the left side of the howitzer using the M187A1 Telescope Mount. The device weighs approximately 16-5/8 pounds, is approximately 16 ¾ inches high, 8 ½ inches wide and 10 inches long. Construction consists primarily of several cast hou sings with precision machined gears, splines, worm, worm wheel, counters and clutches.  Additionally, lenses, prisms, windows and a reticle are included in the optical train.  The reticle and counters are illuminated for night operation.  Assembly requires  expertise in fitting of parts, selective part selection and use of matched parts sets.  M140A1 Alignment Device:  The Alignment Device M140A1 provides on-carriage, mounted, close-in optical reference to provide boresight retention information regarding th e M137A2 Pantel. This device provides an illuminated target reticle at infinity and is mounted by means of a dovetail and clamp.  The device weighs approximately 1¼ pounds, is approximately 11 ½ high, 4 inches wide and 4 inches long.   Construction is from  machined metal parts.  Optical elements include windows, lenses and a reticle.  M186 Mount Telescope:  The M186 Mount Telescope provides mounting for the M90A3 Telescope to the left side of the M119A2 Howitzer.  It consists of a housing, 2 worms, 2 worm w heels and a dovetail with lock.  The device weighs approximately 2 pounds and is approximately 4 inches long, 5 inches wide and 2 ½ inches high.  M187A1 Mount Telescope:  The Telescope, Mount M187A1 adapts the M137A2 Pantel to the M119A2 Howitzer.  The mou nt provides adjustments in elevation and cant (cross-level) for indirect fire for the weapon.  The mount consists of two subassemblies, one mounted on top of the other and secured by four screws.  It, also, provides elevation readout by means of the digita l counter and flats for using the M1A1 Gunners Quadrant.  It weighs approximately 38 pounds and is nominally 13 inches high, 9 ¾  inches wide and 14 1/8 inches long.  Elevation travel is 89 to 1333 mils.  Cross-level is +/- 20 degrees. Counters and level  vials are illuminated for night operation.  The device consists of several castings, worms, worm wheels, 2 digital counters and machined parts.  Manufacture of these items will require the ability to perform precision machining, and assembly of instrument s whereby all parts are manufactured to tolerance and additional skill and experience is required to assemble a compliant instrument.  Access to precision castings (either in-house or subcontracted items), ability to define, produce and acquire gages and f ixturing is required to assemble, test and accept product.  Familiarity with characteristics and assembly of gears is essential.  Ability to acquire and assembl e optical components, some of a complex nature, is necessary to assure compliance with end item requirements.  This will require translation of performance requirements of the instrument to tolerance definition of machined parts and fixtures/gages.   A bid ders conference will be conducted 14 Oct 2004 at US Army TACOM, Rock Island, IL, for interested sources to ask questions, view the respective components, and clarify understanding of the technical/manufacturing requirements of the items.

<SUBJECT>R -- Screening of Passengers and Property at Airports
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE ON SCREENING PARNERSHIP PROGRAM (SPP) NEW WEBSITE
In accordance with The Aviation Security Act, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is actively developing the SPP, also referred to as the Private Security Screening Program or Opt-Out, and plans to be ready to accept applications from airport operators seeking to opt-out on November 19, 2004.
ATSA states that TSA shall allow an airport operator to submit an application to have screening carried out by the screening personnel of a qualified private screening company.
TSA is developing the SPP based on operational experience with the current Pilot program, also created by ATSA (49 U.S.C. 44919) and otherwise known as the PP5 program, key lessons learned and program improvements from evaluation studies, input from internal subject matter experts, such as TSA’s Federal Security Directors (FSDs) and views of external stakeholders.
TSA will begin accepting applications on November 19, 2004 from airport authorities that would like to join the SPP program.  TSA will strive for a transition process that is fair, cost-effective and seamless.  TSA will seek provisions that assist Federal screeners potentially affected by the transition to an Opt-Out environment, including priority for employment with the private contractor and measures to facilitate movement to other TSA or other Federal positions.
In an effort to provide information on the program, TSA has created a web page on the internet which can be accessed at www.tsa.gov.  To access the SPP information, go to bottom right heading entitled “Spotlight” and click on the hyperlink directly under “Spotlight” entitled “Screening Partnership Program.”.  This page contains links to program guidance, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), and press releases.  For more information about the program, please E-mail your questions to OPT-OUT@tsa.dot.gov. TSA will collect all questions, and answers which will be posted on this web page.

<SUBJECT>--Unmanned Systems Capability Conference
<DESC>An Unmanned Systems Capability Conference, co-sponsored by the Joint Robotics Program (JRP) and the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) is scheduled for November 30  December 1 2004. The JRP and TSWG perform similar functions for DoD and other in teragency organizations. The intent is to leverage on efforts and expose users with technology currently available on the robotics market.   This is the first time that a conference has been setup for both the Department of Defense Joint Robotics Program a nd the Interagency Robotics community. The conference will provide a forum for these two programs to attend briefings by Government Program Managers who will be briefing their programs, users briefing their requirements and Robotic Industry all in one conf erence. We fully expect that attendees will come away with a better understanding of what is being developed and what is being articulated by the users for their requirements to meet the current and future threats. The Joint Robotics Program was created by  the direction of Congress in 1989. In FY 1990, Congress directed the consolidation of the Services Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) programs and tasked the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to provide oversight for the newly created JRP. OSD was expe cted to provide policy and program direction to: 1) oversee a consolidated program; 2) concentrate on establishing definitive, robotics operational requirements, and 3) pursue critical technologies to satisfy these requirements. The TSWG is the U.S. nation al forum that identifies, prioritizes and coordinates interagency and international research and development (R&D) requirements for combating terrorism. The TSWG rapidly develops technologies and equipment to meet the high priority needs of the combating t errorism community, and addresses joint international operational requirements through cooperative R&D with major allies. Conference location is the Marriott Bay Point Resort Village in Panama City Beach, Florida. The Air Force Research Lab is the host uni t for the conference. The conference will begin at 0900 on 30 November, 2004 and finish by 1700 on 1 December 2004. The hotel is within 12 miles of the Panama City Airport. We anticipate the following attendees: Users (military and civilian Interagency/sta te/federal and local Bomb squads), Government PMs, Developers, Vendors and Academia. Government Agencies will provide an overview of their robotics programs to develop future cooperative efforts and improve coordination. Participants anticipated to attend  include JRP, NIJ, ODP, DHS, FBI, CIA, DOE, TSWG, EOD/LIC, MOD, USSS, Customs, DOT, PSEAG, USMS, TSA, NIST and NASA. We have a limited space for vendors and space will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. As vendors, we request booths to be setu p for viewing throughout the conference. Booths will be setup in a ballroom area for attendee viewing 2 hours prior to the morning start time, during breaks and lunch, and 2 hours after the days session end. Vendors will not be permitted to attend the bri efing sessions. If you are interested in participating in this inaugural ground breaking event please contact Mr. John Messamore as soon as possible to insure time on the agenda at (850) 974-9624 or jmessamore@titan.com. The deadline for vendor registratio ns is 19 November 2004. Academia will have an area with wallboards from different university robotic programs that will be accessible to all attendees, including vendors. The intent is to facilitate collaboration with government developers and industry.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The government will make a completed Raid House available as a model for the 7 installations. The contractor will install government furnished audiovisual recording equipment in seven (7) Raid Houses located at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. Installation will entail all necessary infrastructures for low –voltage wiring to provide for a cosmetically appealing finished product. Government will provide for all high voltage power requirements. Four (4) Raid Houses will be a complete install with the contractor responsible for infrastructure, wiring, and equipment while three (3) Raid Houses will be the installation of new equipment with contractor possibly able to utilize existing infrastructure and conduit. Each Raid House install will take one week, however; the whole project could take over a six (6) month period from time of award depending on scheduling requirements. 

On the 3 raid houses that are being upgraded, conduit exists and much of the wiring will be able to be reused. Installation shall be coordinated with FLETC/TSB, and will probably be done one raid house at a time, with a possibility of being able to work on two at a time, depending on scheduling. This work will be scheduled so as to avoid interference with ongoing training in Raid Houses. This means there may be a span of 2 to 6 weeks between room availability for install. All existing Audio Visual equipment, including cameras, mounts, switchers, TV’s, monitors, VCR’s and equipment racks will be removed and turned over to the Government. Equipment listed elsewhere in this order shall be installed in existing equipment rack in each room, except on the new installs, where the provided cabinet will need to be installed.  Each raid house has a camera mounted in the front and rear, outside of the structure, so trenching and cable runs need to be done at each site. A job will be completed when all cameras are installed where directed by the TSB staff, all programming is completed by contractor so system operates exactly as the model Raid House, the switcher/controller operates all cameras, recording devices function properly, and a successful demonstration of the system in each room has been shown to the TSB Branch Chief.

The work shall include removal of all trash on a daily basis, removal of any unused cables not necessary for the operation of the new system configuration; it shall also include installation of new cable as required, new cable plugs, and other supplies necessary to ensure the system is fully functional.  Any removed cables from the Raid Houses being upgraded that can be reused without degradation of the signal may be reused.  The contractor shall supply all necessary cables and fittings as required to complete the job and ensure functionality.  All removed cables that are not reused, shall be returned to the government as will all plugs and equipment that are taken out of the rooms.

It is recommended that one room be completed and accepted as a prototype prior to beginning work on the remaining 6 Raid Houses.  The Government will make available a technician to answer technical questions regarding the installation in the prototype room.

All cables shall be clearly marked at both ends with information that will allow the components to be removed and reinstalled without tracing wiring, i.e., DVD audio in, DVD audio out, etc.  Cables shall be arranged neatly and bundled to avoid a safety hazard.  Sufficient cable shall be allowed at termination points to allow work, repairs, etc. to be accomplished easily without unplugging cabling/wiring. Contractor shall provide a complete and comprehensive list of serial numbers and FLETC tag numbers showing the exact location (Raid House) of all installed equipment.

Far Clause 52.212-01, 52.212-03 must be completed and returned with the quotation, 52.212-04 and 52.212-05 with subparagraphs (b)(5)(i), (b)(13) thru (18), (b)(29), (c)(41) are applicable.  The information required by (c)(42) is as follows:  Electronic Technician III is $17.93 Wage Determination No 1994-2115 Rev 30 dated 06/26/2003 is applicable and may be requested via e-mail or fax.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO SOLICITATION NO. COW-4-R-0032


QUESTION:

1.  Our present concern relates to "Work Requirement Number 6".  This states that the key medical personnel must be located within a 50 mile radius of your offices.  May I ask - is this an inflexible requirement? 

Answer:  No, the 50 mile radius requirement is not flexible.

QUESTION:

requirement.  Our FBI contract is still in force and has proven to be extremely workable and successful.  Is there a possibility that this requirement could be reconsidered and waived?  

Answer:  No, the 50 mile radius for this requirement cannot be waived.

QUESTION:

3.  As it is presently written, would a proposal from us be considered, or would it be judged to be non-qualifying?  

Answer:  Proposals not responsive to the RFP requirement will not be considered.

QUESTION:

4. On the first page, the statement that .... "Travel NTE $10,000".  Is this the total limit for travel for the full year of the contract?  

Answer:  "Travel NTE $10,000 is the estimated amount of Travel cost for the Base Year.

QUESTION:

5. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.21203 - **Proprietary **/** High Priority **.   I am trying to find out what the above stated provision entails.  Please advise.

Answer:  You can located this clause in detail at www.arnet.gov.

QUESTION:

6.  Could you please provide guidance concerning the form and format required for responses to the referenced solicitation?  

Answer:  There's no required format.

QUESTION:

7.  Are there specific forms which can be accessed or is a traditional proposal acceptable?

Answer:  A traditional proposal would be acceptable that responds to the RFP.

<DESC>Amendment 0002:  RFQ HSCG38-04-Q-500023 is amended and provides the following additional specification information:  1) In order to accommodate testing low pressure components more precisely by more accurate regulation and larger scale gauges, some test stands have high and low side set-ups.  Low side is normally about 0 – 2250 psi and high side normally would go up to max rated pressure.  A dual sided machine is not necessary if the stand can adequately control/regulate/indicate pressure and flow rates for the entire range of 0 psi to maximum rated pressure.  2) The motor/pump test variable drive requires a motor test pressure port, a pump test supply port and return ports with flow rate and temperature monitoring – One (1) unloading pressure circuit port and Two (2) high pressure or full range ports (separated far enough as to test two individual components under the same test conditions, pressure and flow, etc., also one low pressure port, if needed, to accurately test low pressure components if stand cannot regulate and monitor pressures from 0 to 2250 psi. with adequate accuracy), and one static pressure port. 3) The test stand should have a cycling valve which will alternate pressure supply from two ports and have three positions; pressure side A – return side B, Off, and pressure side B – return side A. 4) The case drain circuit should be capable of regulating and measuring flow from the cases of hydraulic pumps and motors.  It should have a patch filter of 10 microns, regulate back-pressure from 0 to 140 psi, measure flow rate from 0 to 8 GPM, and monitor oil temperature. 5) Amperage required will be provided by the government as needed. Power requirements should be provided by the offeror .  The existing machine, which the government is looking to replace, has a 225 Amp circuit supply.  6)  The main component to be tested on this test stand will be a Constant Speed Hydraulic Motor which drives a 20KVA,  3 phase, 120 Volt, 400Hz generator.  Test requirements are 26 GPM @ 3000 psi and 10 GPM @ 4500 psi.  The purpose of requiring 40 GPM is so this test stand will not be operating at near maximum capacity during testing and shock loading, and to allow for future flexibility. 6) The variable speed pump drive unit should have a universal type drive mounting pad and be capable of up to 50 horsepower loading. 7) The term "manual/remote" is further identified as "local/remote" with "manual and/or local" meaning the indicated functions (flow, pressure, start/stop, temperature, etc.) can be set/adjusted/operated by the technician at the test stand.  "Remote" means these same functions can be set/adjusted/operated at an industrial remotely located computer control station supplied with the test stand.  The closing date for receipt of offers is not extended.****
