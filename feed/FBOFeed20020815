Many of these da! ta compilations are company proprietary and were acquired through Battelle's longstanding relationships with aircraft manufacturers and material suppliers.  Consent to release each of these proprietary data packages to support the mechanical properties in MIL-HDBK-5 to the care of another contractor would not be directly transferable.  All the mechanical property values in the handbook must be traceable to the original data, much of which is proprietary, to substantiate the values.  No other company currently has access to the required data. <P>

<DESC>Technical Services for International Health Issues Contract Number 282-97-0062 was awarded to LTS Corporation on September 30, 1997 to provide services to the Office of International and Refugee Health (OIRH).  Due to a recent reorganization OIRH is now the Office of Global Health Affairs (OGHA) and comes directly under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS).  The new Director of OGHA is also the Special Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and therefore OGHA is involved in the daily international activities of Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. OGHA intends to extend this contract for a year while developing a new competitive requirement that will reflect the new focus and direction of OGHA and anticipated needs of their reorganization.  The current contract will be extended 12 months to support existing essential programmatic activities, until the new contract is awarded.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for A/D (Analog to Digital) VXI Modules with Option OBO. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Agilent Technologies, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) An existing application using this hardware for data acquisition has already been delivered to NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and can be reused in this test effort.  There is insufficient time and resources to develop and/or test another data acquisition application or system.  (b) Pre-existing system at MSFC and Stennis Space Center (SSC) that use the same hardware has provided confidence in the capability of this hardware to meet the functional requirements for this test effort.  There is insufficient time and resources to develop and/or test another hardware approach. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on August 30, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

PwC has developed the only commercial version of TRANSIMS. There is no other firm that possesses the integral knowledge of TRANSIMS necessary for the deployment support at the pilot sites.

The scope of work will require some or all of the following: a Program Development Study (PDS) to define the project requirements and establish a firm construction budget, complete design, metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, renderings, mock-ups, computer graphics, color/material selections and presentations, detailed design investigations, constructability review, systems design and calculations, life cycle costing, value engineering, site design, programming, space planning, and other similar services as determined to be required.  The following optional services may also be negotiated: post construction contract services (PCCS), submittal and shop drawing reviews, partnering and other similar services.  These services will be required for a headquarters facility that includes the full renovation of the existing building and construction of new infill office space and related systems.  The modernization will include replacing all building systems while preserving its historic fabric.  This project will include client program requirements and will comply with standards for sustainable design, energy conservation, ADA, etc.  The building is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities.  Completed in 1917 to house the Department of the Interior, it was the first truly modern office building built by the U.S. Government.  The building has served as a headquarters office, first for the Department of the Interior and now for the GSA, for 85 years.  The building is on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is located at 18th and F Streets, NW. Washington, DC.  It has approximately 68,920 gross square meters, while containing 44,600 usable square meters.  A Feasibility Study completed in December 2000 recommends adding approximately 10,000 rentable square meters of infill space in the courts.  The infill space should be responsive to the overall design.  The limestone clad, neoclassical structure is a 9 story steel frame building with a terra cotta flat arch floor system.  Upon completion of the proposed modernization, the building will be a modern high-performance office building in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, capable of serving for another 50 years.  The A/E team will demonstrate experience in the renovation of historic structures and the introduction of new construction within the context of the historic fabric.  The A/E will be responsible for preparation of documents and presentations required for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA)/National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) reviews.  In addition, the team will demonstrate its ability to design & construct state-of-the-art high performance flexible office space to include HVAC, lighting, controls, and space planning.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to SPARTA, Inc. for the maintenance, upgrading, and updating of the Commander?s Analysis and Planning Simulator (CAPS), a simulation model used to assess missile defense architectures and to demonstrate to potential users how a ballistic missile defense might work.  The required support consists of configuration control; verification, validation, and assessment of CAPS and Ballistic Missile Defense System development Block Representations; software problem corrections; help desk operation; and updates of Specific System Representation parameter files.  As the original designer and developer of CAPS, SPARTA possesses the current requisite technical expertise and demonstrated capabilities to fulfill this requirement.  No other source currently has this expertise.  In addition, awarding to another contractor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency?s requirement to develop and integrate a Ballistic Missile Defense System by the year 2004.  MDA?s aggressive schedule requires specific system representation updates and ballistic missile defense system block upgrades at a minimal rate of once every six months.  Unacceptable delays to these scheduled updates and upgrades would result due to procurement lead time and a significant period of time for a new contractor to become fully proficient at contract performance.  To avoid these delays by awarding the contract to another contractor for concurrent contract performance with SPARTA, Inc. while the new contractor gained full proficiency would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The Government has invested approximately $10 million dollars in the development, maintenance, upgrades, and for another source to obtain the expertise required to execute contract performance would necessitate a significant duplication of these costs.  The estimated cost and period of performance for this cost-plus-fixed-fee effort is $8 million during the sixty (60) month, base year with four option years, period of November 2002 to November 2007.  See Note 22.

This sources sought/market survey is to determine the capability of industry to provide spare parts for the Common Ground Station (CGS).  The CGS provides support to Army Field commanders by simultaneously receiving, processing, manipulating storing, displaying and disseminating intelligence information from multiple sensors and intelligence broadcast networks and by disseminating targeting and intelligence information to intelligence, fire support and command and control elements from Brigade to Echelons Above Corps (EAC).  The CGS includes vehicles, one Lightweight Multipurpose Shelter, mission equipment, support equipment, software, generators, and trailer s.  This system receives data from the Joint STARS E8 airborne multi-mode radar subsystem, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and the Commander’s Tactical Terminal (CTT). Although CGS systems consist of a significant amount of Commercial-Off- the-Shelf (COTS) it ems the COTS items are modified at the exclusive direction of the manufacturing contractor.  The Government does not have data on the modifications or any other technical data package and does not plan to procure one.  System software (source code only) is  proprietary to the developer/manufacturer and is not owned by the Government. Interested sources for this effort who have the technical, production and program managerial experience in this type of work are invited to send a response describing, in detail  their ability to deliver   Suppliers capable of furnishing spares must respond by writing to Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-C-JS, Building 1201E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a sole source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-02-G-3041 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, MO for the product improvement of the Fuel Boost Static Inverter for the T45 TS aircraft. McDonnell Douglas Corporation is the sole developer and manufacturer of the T45 TS aircraft.  The redesigned fuel boost pump static inverter eliminates the growing risk of parts obsolescence, improves reliability and electromagnetic compatibility, and is interchangeable with the current inverter. In addition, a RFI suppressor has been integrated into the new invertor. The baseline production configuration will replace the current invertor (vpn 509-1-02902-00) with the new invertor (vpn 509-1-02950-020). In support of maintaining interchangeability, the new invertor has been designed to operate in conjunction with the existing external RFI suppressor. This eliminates the need to remove suppressors in the fleet prior to installation of the new invertor as a spared item. The new boost pump static invertor will be coded as two-way interchangeable and made the preferred spare. This will allow for the old and new invertors to be installed together or separately. No retrofit required. Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D88340.  These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 7389 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order for the following three projects.  1. Criteria used in the approval or alternate modes of administration of oral dosage forms in special populations i.e. pediatric and elderly patients.  Objective: systematically examine and analyze the in-house and published data (in vitro, in vivo in the form of bioavailability and/or clinical data or a combination) with the goal of standardizing the regulatory requirements for future submissions.   Deliverable: Survey and analysis of currently existing in-house and published clinical and biopharmaceutics data to establish the criteria used in different applications to specify acceptable means of administering the drug other than as the manufactured dosage form.  The range of foods allowed will be identified and the basis for the selections will be determined.  2.  Proper Dosage Adjustment in Subpopulations.  The objectives: to examine and validate the assumption that exposure-response relationship is similar between adults and children in selected therapeutical drug classes, to provide a list of conditions where the assumption is valid, and to explore the methodology for future studies in aspects.  Contractor will use the PK/PD modeling analysis focused on the relationship and explain why similarity is not seen, or in what concentration or dose range the similarity may be apparent.  3. Proper Dosage Adjustment in Subpopulations.  The objective is to provide a method for integrating all factors that significantly affect the drug PK and/or PD and generate reasonable dosage recommendations for the labeling.  Results should enable the agency to guide the industry and in making decisions regarding the benefit of integration of multiple factors on dosage.  This is NDA data collection and survey-based with in-depth data analysis. Deliverables: Pharmacokinetic information, clinical safety and efficacy information along with demographic, pathologic and disease variables from clinical trials in various drug classes will be extracted from 10 newly approved NDA?s.  Data will be analyzed for covariate effect on drug total body clearance (CL) and volume of distribution through mixed effect modeling analysis.  Identify independent, interactive and confounding factors that have impact on the pharmacokinetics properties of the drug.  Proposals for dose selection considering integrated factors for some hypothetical subjects will be defined.  Proposals of dose selection based on current best practice will also be determined.  Plasma drug concentrations for each proposal will be simulated based on the known pharmacokinetic properties and subject specific variables.  Profiles will then be compared to: those observed from specific subjects who had desired clinical outcomes and those observed from a typical young male normal subject.  Rank the 5 dose selection proposals based on the degree of similarities to the standard concentration-time profiles.  Form general statistics and a recommendation on future general dosage adjustment strategy.  Period of Performance: One year from date of award.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.

<CONTACT>Debora Pitts, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-3789, Fax 301-443-5462, Email dpitts@hrsa.gov
<DESC>The Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 - SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT), 520 SW Sixth Avenue, Suite 700, Portland, OR   97204.  This a small business set aside.   The contractor shall design a National Data Resource Center on Children with Special Health Needs.  Millions of Dollars have been invested by HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) in the first National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.   HRSA proposes to design a data resource center to translate data from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs into information that will support state agencies and empower families in their efforts to meet the Health People 2010 objectives for children with special health care needs.  FAACT  has developed and maintains the copyright to the Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Screener.  This five question-screening tool was used to identify the sample of children health care needs for the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.  Prior to the development of this tool, a survey such as the National Survey of CSHCN would have not been possible as a standardized survey-based method for identifying CSHCN. FACCT is the sole owner of the database for the Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener and is the only contractor that has the expertise with survey-based methods for identifying and interviewing families with CSHCN, which was gained in FACCT work developing the screener.  Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of database would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, the FACCT is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(B) (1).  Note Number 22

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The contractor shall develop and deliver training and technical assistance programs to the 10 Health Start Communities projects where the Maternal & Child Health Bureau, HRSA, has identified a need for such assistance.   These communities are finding perinatal substance abuse to be a significant contributing factor to infant mortality in their population and that have been previously received substance abuse technical assistance.  It will consist of 10 technical assistance visits.   CRT promotes healthy development of children and their families by focusing on transferring knowledge gained from research and clinical trial.   CRT develops community-based programs that specifically address the needs of high-risk children.   CRT has conducted needs assessments and provided training and technical assistance for 45 Health Start Community sites across the country with a focus on integrating substance abuse screening, assessment and referral into the prenatal care programs.  CRT's expertise allows   them to deliver technical assistance that is effective in influencing the target audience to develop systems of care that can practically and efficiently screen for substance abuse during pregnancy.  CRT is the only vendor capable of providing the required substance abuse technical assistance to the Healthy Start Community nationally.  Any other organization that attempts to development this type of expertise would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, the Children's Research Triangle (CRT) is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (B) (1).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a mission to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  NIST conducts several programs in support of U.S. manufacturing, including the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).  The RFQ will focus on improving the strategies by which NIST evaluates funding opportunities in support of U.S. manufacturing industries.  The NIST programs that serve U.S. manufacturing must be aware of the measurement, standards, and technology needs of manufacturers and are always interested in learning about opportunities to support advanced manufacturing.  This effort should bring together many and varied resources from the U.S. manufacturing sector.  The results should be a report that authoritatively documents and identifies emerging technologies, market trends,  and industries that represent viable opportunities for NIST to better support and communicate about advanced manufacturing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Anna DeGurse, Contract Specialist, fax 703-787-1009, anna.degurse@mms.gov
<DESC>The following is added to this solicitation: Deliverables for this requirement must be Section 508 compliant. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (found at 29 U.S.C. 794d) requires access to and use of information by individuals with disabilities. A deliverable such as electronic reports (ex: PDF files) to be placed on the web (either on the agency's web server or the company's), video footage, or other electronic data such as CD-ROMs to be distributed, are subject to Section 508 guidelines. Simplified, this means that PDF files need to be formatted so that they are "readable" by assistive technology devices such as screen readers. Video footage must be closed captioned. CD-ROMs which contain HTML, PDF, or word processor files must be assessable. Here are several questions we have answered concerning this requirement. Q: I am trying to understand what you are looking for in your bid I will work a profile up for your 15 minutes video. A: We are looking for sample of similar projects your company may have completed as well as a detailed cost estimate for the 12-15 minute documentary. The estimate should take into consideration the resources required and logistics of having to shoot footage in Africa (approx. 10 days) and production of a high quality product in a short time period. Q: Since the requirement is for a 12 to 15-minute video, I wanted to confirm the requirement for television advertisement. Does this mean 30 to 60 second commercial spots or by extension a corporate promotional video piece? A: A corporate promotional video would be more in line as a sample for this proposal. Q: Also required are two copies of, "e) A radio, television, and print advertisement in which the writing of the script was a requirement. f) A radio, television, and print advertisement production of similar size, scope and length." Is the writing of the "script" for the print advertising understood to be the "copy" of the ad? A: Yes. Q: Will there be any videotaping required in Washington D.C.? A: Possibly, final determination of filming requirements in D.C. has not yet been made. Q: Is an English language-only product acceptable? Will there be a translator available on-site and during editing, if needed to translate the interviews? A: An English language only product is acceptable. Given that both Uganda and Namibia are English speaking, there will be no need for a translator. ADF will provide local escorts. Q: Does this need to be Sec. 508 compliant. A: This requirement does need to be Section 508 compliant. Q: Is the scope of this project for an entire media campaign (print, radio and television)? We're seeking clarification here since you are requesting a 12-15 minute documentary type video, yet in the examples you request you are looking for examples of print, radio and television advertisement. I'm confused about why you need print and radio if this project is a 12-15 minute video. A: The video will serve as a basis for continued promotional efforts, which may include print. However, print and radio samples are not absolutely necessary at this time. If your production company does not have these capabilities, lack of these services will not negatively affect the selection evaluation. Q: Do you require us to submit Representations and Certifications. If so, where should we acquire them? A: This does not have to be completed at this time. (Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-3). Q: Do you have any preference for a format to shoot this on? A: VHS or digital video will be acceptable. Q: Finally, is the 15th of October going to change for delivery. You are not allowing a great deal of time to select a vendor and get the work scheduled, shot and edited. A: The deadline date as stated is October 15th. This date will not change. Q: For past performance, we are asked to submit samples of "television and print advertisements" - however it is not clear why the print component is required if this is purely a video production. My company has a background in documentary film production yet we have not created projects that have a "print advertisement" component. If we submit samples that are documentary in nature, will this be acceptable? A: Yes, a documentary film is acceptable. Q: Again referring to the samples, we have scripts that were written for documentary projects and promotional videos (as opposed to pure advertisements). Is this acceptable? A: Yes. Q: Will the video producer be required to create alternative language versions (i.e. for an African audience) under the proposed budget? A: No alternative language versions will be required. Q: For the budget, do you want to see a detailed budget (3 to 4 pages) or a simple one-page? A: We would like to see as detailed of a budget as possible. Q: Is the small biz requirement for companies over $25 mil in revenues or below? A: This requirement is for businesses with revenue below $25 million. Q: Can you give an estimate of the travel time required within Africa? Are there multiple locations in each area, if so, how far are they from Each other, how long is it anticipated to take and how will the crew travel? How many interviews will need to be video taped? A: The filming will take place in both Uganda and Namibia over a period of 10 days. The sites in Uganda are within a 2-hour drive of each other. It will take one day to travel between Uganda and Namibia. The ADF will be responsible for all travel arrangements. The actual number of interviews has not yet been determined. Q: Are there security issues for the crew and need for security precautions? If so, how are they handled and at whose expense? A: There are no security issues in either Namibia or Uganda. Q: The RFP mentions that the producer's are responsible for stock footage or archival. Is there a sense of how much, and is there any footage or visual material that belongs to ADF? A: The video should consist mainly of footage of our current project and interviews. Stock footage is acceptable, however, should not comprise the majority of the production. ADF will not be providing any of the stock footage for this production. Q: We have done a few video projects for the Federal Government, including travel to Europe, Africa, and Central America. These projects are lengthy (15 to 30 min). Do we send in the full-length versions or excerpts would be acceptable? A: Full-length submissions will be accepted; however, all submissions must be kept under 20 minutes each. Q: The solicitation states that ADF shall provide international travel, lodging and transportation. Would this include: excess baggage fees if any, fixer fees (such as translator and driver) and departure taxes? A: Yes, all costs incurred for travel and transportation would be paid by ADF. Q: Is the final VHS deliverable to be in NTSC format and/or PAL format? A: The final deliverable would be preferred in both formats; however either format is acceptable. Q: Is it possible to get some specifics on the concepts and applications of venture philanthropy used by the African Development Foundation? A: Information regarding ADF's strategies, philosophies and policies can be obtained from the website at www.adf.gov <http://www.adf.gov/> . Q: First, do you have a preferred format for the proposal and budget? Will a detailed excel spreadsheet be adequate for the budget estimate? This initial budget will need to be developed based on some preliminary assumptions re Footage acquisition, style, etc. Is this ok? A: There is no official format for the proposal submission. A detailed budget spreadsheet is acceptable. All assumptions made regarding footage acquisition, style etc should be clearly communicated along with the resulting impact on the budget. Q: Next, the proposal suggests that the final deliverable is a VHS master. This is not a problem, but we typically deliver a broadcast quality betacamSP or digital beta master, which makes far better VHS dubs. Should we budget for this? A: The ADF is looking for a top quality product and is open to suggestions. Please use your professional judgment in budgeting the proper resources, materials etc, which will ensure the highest quality output. Q: Which programs in the target countries are to be featured? Are those programs currently on the website? Why were those particular programs chosen for the motion picture presentation? A: Determination of the featured projects has not yet been finalized. Information on potential projects can be found in the country profiles located on the website. Q: What are the Baseline funding criteria of ADF? A: Information regarding ADF's strategies, philosophies and policies can be obtained from the website at www.adf.gov <http://www.adf.gov/> . Q: Is there a preferred vendor for the project (a vendor that has done similar videos for ADF in the past)? A: There is no preferred vendor for this project. This project is a first of its kind for the ADF, thus requiring a very collaborative approach. Q: Who will we work with us in developing the script? Is there an outline developed yet? Is there a "shot-list" that may have been developed? If so can this information be sent to all potential bidders? A: The selected production company is expected to work closely with an ADF representative to develop and outline/storyboard and ensure that all messages are effectively captured and portrayed. Q: Does DOI-ADF anticipate shooting locations to be mainly exteriors or interiors or a mixture of both? (We are trying to determine lighting requirements) A: We anticipate the shooting will be a mixture of indoor and outdoor shots, with a significant portion being outdoor footage. Q: Based on flight schedules do you anticipate shooting in Namiba first and then Uganda? A: Tentatively, we are planning on shooting in Uganda, followed by Namibia. Q: DOI-ADF will provide air transportation, ground transportation for crew and equipment, guides, interpreters, hotel, per diem. Is this cost included in the budget range indicated? A: The cost of travel and accommodations are not included in the proposed budget range. Q: The RFP mentions repurposing images for print. Broadcast video cameras only offer a resolution of 72 DPI which is well below the requirements for print. Should a photographer be added to the crew? Or are small images from the video acceptable? A: Images extracted from the video are acceptable provided the quality is sufficient to be used on the Website or in print. Q: Can we assume DOI-ADF wants footage shot and edited on broadcast level equipment such as Digital Betacam, DVCPRO50 or BetacamSP? A: Yes Q: What are the dates you plan on shooting in Africa? A: We anticipated filming to take place on location during the weeks of September 9 and September 16th. Q: Do your contacts with DOI-ADF have a list of inoculations they recommend? A: Information on vaccination requirements by country can be obtained from the World Health Organization's Int'l Travel and Health website at www.who.int/ith/index.html <http://www.who.int/ith/index.html> . Q: The RFP mentions that the producer's are responsible for stock footage or archival. Is there a sense of how much, and is there any footage or visual material that belongs to ADF? A: ADF currently owns no production-quality footage of the projects it funds. For this project, the production company is responsible to shoot, edit and produce the final product, and is also responsible for storage/archive of all footage until requested by ADF - whether used in the final product or not. ADF retains to exclusive rights to all footage obtained during the production of this project, and no footage may be used by the production company without explicit written permission of ADF. Q: Reflecting the ADF mandate for sustainable, grass-roots programs, do you have a structure that would allow our firm to send low-cost camcorders to Ugandan and Namibian participants and allow them to create their own testimonials? These would be translated and edited into the video presentation by our editorial staff. A: This approach does not seem desirable as it may present potential film quality issues and not provide the opportunity to ensure the proper message being communicated in the interviews.

<DESC>***PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TIME FOR SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS ON THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2002***


The U.S. Customs Service is seeking submission of industry comments for the following Statement of Objectives (SOO):


NATIONAL PRIME INTEGRATION CONTRACT PROGRAM
INTEGRATED LOGISTICS and OPERATIONS

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

INTRODUCTION

This Statement Of Objectives (SOO) describes the basic objectives of the U.S. Customs Service National Prime Integration Contract for Integrated Logistics and Operations support for Customs inventory of High Technology Enforcement Equipment (HTEE) and is provided in lieu of a written Government Statement Of Work (SOW). This approach provides potential offeror?s the flexibility to develop scalable cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to satisfy the stated objectives. 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Customs Service has deployed over 6,500 technically complex and high value inspection devices throughout the land border crossings, airports and seaports of the United States. These devices, employing a variety of technologies, are tools to enforce compliance with all U.S. laws associated with persons and goods entering and leaving the country.  THESE DEVICES ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT DEVICES AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. The end user of the devices is the uniformed Customs Officer and the devices themselves are categorized as crew-served and individual.  Crew-served devices require more than one operator, individual devices require only one operator. The HTEE devices were manufactured by companies such as SAIC, AS&E, CSECO, Rapiscan, Olympus, Leica, etc. Maintenance is currently provided by the OEMs for their respective products via a variety of contractual instruments and by 10 technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service whose permanent duty stations are field locales. Training of Customs Officers is being provided by the OEMs, technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service and the Arizona National Guard.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Statement Of Objectives is to secure a prime contractor/business partner to be responsible for implementing the U.S. Customs Service National Enforcement Equipment Maintenance and Repair Program and Field Operations Support. 

This approach acquires, measures, accepts and pays for contract performance outcomes and results. As such, it leaves to the contractor to employ whatever prudent management and operations methods are necessary to deliver the results required by the U.S. Customs Service.  

Implementation of the contract must be scalable. The number of devices, the number of students, and the locations will be increasing for the foreseeable future.

The business partner shall be responsible for:

* full program management and controls of the logistics necessary to assure that the user will be presented with a device that will not only meet performance requirements, but which will be expeditiously and economically supported throughout its programmed life-cycle. 

*ensuring the proper planning and integration of all elements of logistics support and logistics support resource funds and management information.

* ensuring an orderly phase-in at the outset of the contract without compromising instant and scheduled maintenance and training actions.

* Ensuring an orderly phase-out in the event of re-competition or termination. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all data developed during the course of the contract, with the exception of proprietary financial data, can be readily transferred to and utilized by the Government or follow-on contractor at no cost.

We are seeking to contract with a business partner who is a SERVICE PROVIDER. This business partner should be an expert logistics program implementer and integrator with focus on customer satisfaction.

Specifically, the business partner shall be responsible for:

1. Maintaining the HTEE at a minimum Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%.  

1.1 Service records and logbooks.

1.2 Fluid storage and waste disposal.  

1.3 Corrosion control.

2. Training Customs Officers to operate the HTEE. The content of training shall always be up-to-date with respect to the physical configuration of the HTEE and operating recommendations of the HTEE manufacturer. 

3. Implementing post-production support to sustain out-of-production HTEE, maintain configuration control of all equipment changes and project replacement  of high maintenance cost HTEE equipment exhibiting wear-out symptoms.

3.1 Implementing HTEE changes and modifications and exercising change control. 

4. Staffing and operating a 7 X 24 central "Service Desk" at a contractor provided Operations Center. Providing total asset visibility of the operational status of all crew served HTEE equipment in USCS inventory in near real time. The Service Desk shall be collocated with the NEEMR Program Office.

5. Relocating HTEE from one Customs location to another. 

6. Reporting figures of merit so that the government may assess performance of HTEE, the program and of the contractor.

7. Procuring and Installing government specified video security systems at Customs facilities.

8. Program management.

8.1 Implementing an integrated logistics support program to ensure that maintenance planning, support tools and test equipment, parts, supplies, consumables, material handling, data processing, and packaging, handling, storage, and transportation support elements are available and utilized to yield safe, reliable and mission capable HTEE.

8.2. Establishing a program management office within 5 miles of the NEEMR facility including the facility for contractor personnel and not more than 8 specified U.S. Customs Service personnel to include but not be limited to managers, Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and project monitors.

8.3. Providing sufficient and appropriately skilled and located managers, service center operators, trainers, maintainers and engineering personnel to successfully fulfill the objectives of this Statement Of Objectives.

8.3.1 Applicable and required licenses, Secret level security clearances for all business partner personnel, and certificates for business partner personnel. The Customs Service will conduct background investigations on all employees.

8.3.2 Uniforms and identifying names/logos/insignia for business partner personnel working in Customs land border crossings, airports and seaports.

8.4 Accomplishing the objectives herein at Customs Ports of Entry and other Customs stations and during the hours of operation of the Customs locations; performing the requirements herein during crisis periods declared by the National Command Authority. 

8.5 Compliance with applicable local, city, state and federal laws, rules and regulations and union/management agreements.

8.6 Financial cost accounting and logistics reporting.

9. Fuels and lubricants required by the HTEE. 

10. Physical security for the HTEE.

11. Adapt to a dynamic environment of increased HTEE equipment as well as increased training requirements. Dynamic means that the number of devices to be supported, the number of Customs Officers to be trained, the number of locations, and the reporting requirements will be increasing at unknown and non-linear rates. 

12. Adapt to provide HTEE operators as required.

Note: Procurement of HTEE devices is not within the scope of the Statement of Objectives.

<CONTACT>Rickie Bowens Contract Specialist 4046794064 rickie_bowens@fws.gov;
<DESC>This announcement supercedes the previous announcements. This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 36; Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to issue  three (3) Indefinite Quantity Architectural and Engineering (A/E) Services contracts for various services. The following describes the areas and types of work contemplated. All, part, or none of the work may be required at any location within the Southeast Region (Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida) Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  1. Construct Visitor Center -Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, near Savannah, Georgia  Construct a visitor center that will include exhibitry, site work, and exterior interpretive facilities. The proposed site is undeveloped, so utilities, roads, and parking lots will be required. The building will incorporate the unified approach to programming and design for Fish and Wildlife Service Visitor Facilities being developed by National Wildlife Refuge System, Fishery System and Engineering staffs.  Construction of an education/visitor center will allow increased opportunities for education, and recreation to visitors, schools, and organizations. The refuge has an estimated 130,000 visitors annually. The new visitor center will draw people into the refuge by informing them about the auto tour route and hiking trails in a friendly, environmental education facility. This increase in visibility of wildlife and habitat is estimated to double annual visitation, thereby increasing refuge program support. Composed of diverse habitat types ranging from bottomland hardwood forests to freshwater wetlands, the Refuge supports approximately 40,000 waterfowl, and shorebirds, wading birds, alligators, and deer. This new education/visitor center will help define the identity of the Refuge as a key component of the southern tier of the National Wildlife Refuge System, accessible to the public, and a protector of native wildlife species and their habitats.  Professional Services required may include:  Surveying, Geotechnical Engineering investigations and reports, Civil Engineering, Architectural Design, Structural Engineering, Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Engineering, Landscape Architectural Design, Exhibit Design, Value Engineering Study, Cost Estimating, assistance obtaining permits, preparation of construction contract documents (drawings and specifications) and other services as required or typical for building and site development projects.  2. ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge -Rehabilitate Bonny Hall Perimeter Dike, near Charleston, SC  Rehabilitate 12,000 feet of existing, eroded dike for the 450-acre Bonny Hall Impoundment #1 on the Combahee Unit. This impoundment is the largest on the Combahee River and is essential for foraging endangered wood storks, wintering waterfowl and many wading bird species. This outside/river dike has eroded over time due to age, wave action and severe weather. This project would build the dike to 3 feet above high water mark, with 14 feet tops, and 3 to 1 inside slopes. The restoration of this dike is critical to refuge management on the Combahee Unit.  Professional Services required may include Surveying, Geotechnical Engineering  investigations and reports, Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, Value Engineering  Study, Cost Estimating, assistance obtaining permits, preparation of construction contract documents (drawings and specifications) and other services as required or typical for site development projects of this type.  3. Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge -Dominick House Rehabilitation, Bull Island near Charleston, SC  Rehabilitate the Dominick House. Facility is used by refuge staff as quarters when on  duty on Bulls Island for public use activities and law enforcement. Replace windows and flooring, roofing, siding, plumbing/electrical as needed; paint all areas of the house as needed. These major repairs are required to maintain this house that is potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.

<SUBJECT>59 -- GOES Receive Antenna Systems for NESDIS/NSOF
<SOLNBR>52-DGNE-2-90012
<RESPDATE>082602
<ARCHDATE>09102002
<CONTACT>Jay  Moore, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-2126, ext. 112, Fax 301-427-2164, Email jay.moore@noaa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis advertises the Government's need for four (4) Azimuth/Elevation (Az/El) remotely controllable paraboloidal receive antenna systems for the new NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, MD. The NSOF will house the antennas on its roof and is planned for early 2004. This advertisement is to conduct market research to define the approach for acquiring these systems, which are believed to be commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101, and to advertise the intent to release a solicitation. Each antenna system shall consist of: (a) the paraboloidal antenna; (b) a dual band - L/X feed sub-system; (c) dual redundant LNA paths for each feed; (d) an antenna local, operations area remote monitor/control, and external PC interface; (e) interconnecting cabling between the roof antenna and an operation control area, (f) dual redundant L-Band Downconverters, (g) 70 MHz Intermediate Frequency (IF) Distribution amplifiers, and  (h) an L-Band receiver. The X-Band receiver may be acquired separately. The system operational frequencies are L-Band: 1675 - 1710 MHz; X-Band 7450 - 8400 MHz. The following figures of merit are estimated, and potential interested Offerors are welcome to propose an alternate link budget: planned G/T: L-Band: 18.1 dB/K; X-Band: 31 dB/K (10 deg. Elev.). End-to-end amplitude is 1dB peak-to-peak. VSWR is at 1.2:1 over applicable operating frequency band. Control is in step-track, maintaining signal strength at +/- .25 dB, program track, and manual positioning. Drive system is required to provide pointing accuracy of +/- 10% of 3dB bandwidth at max. operating frequency in low wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .020 deg.); +/- 20% of 3 dB, medium wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .040 deg.); +/- 40% in high winds wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .080 deg.). Max. velocity is .25 deg./sec/ AZ; .25 deg./sec. EL. Max. Accel. @ .25 deg./sec.2. The system must include a remote Control, Monitor, and Test sub-system (CMTs) operated by personal computer NIC interface, allowing remote position control, status assessment, or test of any of the four antenna systems. System hardware and CMT's must be based on off-the-shelf designs, equipment, and components with an extensively tested and stable operational heritage. Some customization of the CMT is likely. The future system will operate 24x7 with a 99.9 percent availability rate over its systems life cycle.  Also highly desirable is that the hardware systems be upgrade-able to accommodate technology refreshment as needed, without requiring substantive software re-programming, or causing a major disruption to the structure or other interfaced components, the antenna hardware/firmware, or the CMT system. The antennas will be installed, tested, and integrated on the roof of the NSOF (a web site is being constructed). The government will provide access to the new building's electrical power, signal and power grounding system, lightning protection, and signal conduits from the roof to the operations area. The CMTs shall be installed in a designated NSOF operations area. This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information herein is expressed as both a market survey and a presumed statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202, barring any information to the contrary.  The intent of this synopsis is to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002 and also to identify any appropriate commercial practices. NOAA plans to tailor the provisions of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include: financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; standard Government test, inspection and acceptance procedures; and extended warranty-if applicable to commercial practices.  Respondents to this notice are requested to provide any necessary feedback on commercial terms and conditions, tracking and feed designs, and other performance traits such as pointing accuracy, surface tolerances, the gain distribution system, and a link budget for the performance capabilities contemplated that are common in this industry. The Government intends to streamline this acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures to the extent practicable.  The Market Survey responses are due at the location specified below (five paper copies and one electronic copy) by July 9, 2002. Designate those sections that are business proprietary and subject to exclusion from release under the FOIA. An RFP is anticipated for release o/a July 12, 2002. IMPORTANT!! Those interested in this requirement should contact Mr. Jay W. Moore, NPOESS/Integrated Program Office, 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, MD 20910; Tel. 301-427-2079, ext. 112, and provide full contact information.  No additional pre-RFP release notice is planned. A draft of the full specification is also planned for advance release to any interested potential offerors.  Requests for further information must be made by e-mail. See Note #25.

<SOLNBR>M6740002T0838
<RESPDATE>081902
<CONTACT>Major Steve Schmid
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from contractors: Q.  Are the lockers to be steel? solid plastic? wood? A.  All materials will be considered in the technically acceptable determination.  However, they must be warranted for a minimum of 10 years against rust and other types of corrosion, termite damage, delamination, or breakage.  Okinawa is an extremely humid environment and Marines are the toughest of customers.  Metal would have a hard time living up to these standards.  The lockers being replaced are wood and have suffered severe termite damage. Q.  The lockers are shown 20" deep on the drawings and 18" deep in the solicitation.   A.  The dimensions of the lockers requested are an industry standard size and are the size we are looking for.  20" is the size of the space they will be placed in.   Q.  Please advise if the double tier locker s on this req #m674002t0838 are to have coat rods and shelves like the single tier lockers? A.  The double tier lockers do not require a shelf or a rod.  Coats hooks are optional. Q.  Must the shelf in the single tier locker be located 18" down from the top or can our standard 9" down from the top be acceptable? A.  The solicitation states no more than 18". so if your standard is less than 18", that is acceptable. Q:  Please let me know if you will accept our proposal with a different delivery date. A.  We are flexible with the delivery date.  We will not throw out a proposal based on delivery date alone.  Any shipment date prior to 15 November will be considered.  Provide your proposed alternate ship date.   Q:  What is the POE for CLIN 1001? A.  For purposes of providing a quote, Tracy, California or the contractor’s location will be the POE.  Military Transpor tation Management Command (MTMC) will provide instructions when you call them in accordance with clause BT.  In the past, they have directed shipment to a POE or coordinated a container for pickup of the goods at the contractor’s location.  If MTMC directs pickup at the contractor's site, then the contract price will reflect no cost for transportation and neither of the two option CLINs, 1001 and 1002, will be exercised.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to replace the previously posted commercial evaluation clause with a revised clause.  The government intends to make award to that offer determined most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i)    	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   	PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)   PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which is slightly more important than factor II.  When combined, Technical and Past Performance are approximatel y equal to price. Contractors that propose security systems that meet the General Requirements of the SOW will be determined technically acceptable.   Offers that meet the general requirements of the SOW and offer additional enhanced systems, representing or meeting the definition of Optimal Systems, will be evaluated further.  The government reserves the right to make award to other than the low price offeror where an optimal system is proposed. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical informat ion submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and reference s to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it  has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a bindi ng contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Response to the Naval School of Health Sciences Security System Proposal questions: Question #1:  What type of equipment do we bid?   Do we bid a swipe card/Mag Stripe reader system using the existing Military ID card with a mag stripe on it or do we bid a proximity card reader system that we issue new proximity cards with photo ID and other information printed by a direct PVC card printer?   Answer:  The desire is for the proximity reader configured to read the new military I.D. "Smart Cards".  For specifications and information on the new military I.D./"Smart Cards" please refer to the website: http://www.dmdc.osd.mil/smartcard/owa/ShowPage?p=CACDEVEOPERSKIT A good point of contact to address the Smart Card technology is Gene Rosendahl at telephone number (703) 696-1633. Question #2: Do you want to have a keypad at every entry point into the building along with a swi pe/proxy reader?  What is stopping a person from using the keypad everyday instead of using his/her ID card? Keypads are not the safest form of access control. Keypad numbers can be told to other people to gain access. Answer:  No - Only one keypad is required, which will be located on the 1st floor outside of our main entrance - on the exterior wall of our Security/Duty room. Question #3:  Do we bid door-locking hardware for the doors or do we bid electrified locks for the doors?  There is a cost difference. Answer:  The doors will require electrified locks. Question #4:  Do we have to provide conduit for every wire, or can we run wire above the drop down ceilings (as long as they are hidden)? Answer:  Conduit is required for all electrical wire with voltage of 110 and above.  Teflon base Telecommunication wire can be free running.   Question #5:  What is the  desired database management system? Answer:  The expectation is that the vendor will provide the database software and hardware capable of:  Allowing us to enter our population (name by name and where they are authorized to be/access in the building) and then capable of providing tracking and access reports, as well as denying access to areas that personnel are not authorized to enter/and the ability to generate reports on those instances as well. Question #6: What track do you want to read on your existing magnetic stripes? Answer:  As stated above in the answer to Question #1 we do prefer a proximity reader that is capable of reading the new Military I.D./Smart Card. For any and all info. on the new I.D./Smart Card check the website:  http://www.dmdc.osd.mil/smartcard/owa/ShowPage?p=CACDEVEOPERSKIT Question #7:  Currently no access control/or installation d ealer in Southern California meets the FAR 52.219-1 & 52.219.6 or Title 13 part 121.Please inform us what manufacturers you are specifying? Answer:  The government is not specifying manufacturers.  Market research has been performed and it has been determined that there are at least two small business manufacturers that have certified as small businesses.  The RFP does not restrict contractors to the Southern California area therefore, manufacturers may be located elsewhere outside of California.  Question #8:  Please specify the communication type you would like us to use to communicate to your monitoring station which is located at the 32nd Naval Base Facility. If this information is not available please specify the Alarm receiver types you have at that location.  If possible a map or written information specifying which doors will be the access control doors and which  are to be contacted (monitored). Answer:  A telecommunication system would be desired/required.  Currently unable to provide information on the alarm receiver located at 32nd street.  QUESTION #9:  What kind of device did you have in mind to shunt the door contacts for exiting?  If the intention is to use the system as a security system you will need something for this such as a request to exit motion sensor or crashbar. Answer:  We have panic hardware currently installed on our classroom and glass exit doors.  This is the way that I envision the system working:  The alarm system will not be active during the normal working day.  Access to the building will be cut off/the alarm system will be armed at the end of each day.  When the system is armed if someone is still inside this building and needs to leave/exit (after security has made the  final announcement to exit  the building) anyone who leaves via the panic hardware will set off an alarm.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  Closing date for receipt of offers is 19 Aug 2002 3:00 PM PST

for
VACUUM SYSTEMS FOR BOOK CLEANING


1.0 GENERAL

The following is a request for your proposal to supply and install two (2) HEPA vacuum systems for book cleaning for THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. These vacuum systems will be used in the Loading Dock Processing Area (LDPA), which is located at the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building in Washington, D.C.   This LDPA is to be used to prepare library books for storage in a high density storage facility that is being constructed at Fort Meade, Maryland.

The two vacuum systems, which are shown on attached LDPA drawings (A-1, A-2, E-1, E-2, EP-101, M-101, fx100, FA-101 dated 12/06/01)  are to be used to clean the outside covers of books that are brought to two workstations in containers that are moved on carts. A description of the operation of these vacuum systems is included in this Request for Quotation. 

1.1 REQUESTED SCHEDULE

The vacuum systems are to be installed and turned over by September 30, 2002.  The following are some key dates with respect to the purchase and installation of the vacuum systems:
 
			
	1.11. Proposals Due					August 15, 2002		
	1.12. Award of Order					August 16, 2002	
	1.13  Delivery of system design			August 29, 2002		
	1.14. Delivery of vacuum systems			September 23, 2002		
	1.15. Test period for vacuum systems		September 30, 2002		
	1.16. Training program for operators			September 30, 2002		
	1.17. Completion and turn-over of complete system	September 30, 2002		
	1.18  Warranty period				One year from date of 1.17

2.0 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The primary purpose of the vacuum systems covered by this RFQ is to allow Library operators to clean books, containers and other materials at an approximate rate of 4,000 books or book equivalents per day. After being cleaned, the books will be sorted at other stations by size, placed into special book boxes and transported to the Library of Congress Storage Facility at Fort Meade, Maryland.  

The two vacuum systems are be used continuously for one or more shifts per day for 5 days per week.  The systems are to be capable of  operation  with simple control inputs from operators.  




2.1 COMPONENTS

There are to be two independent duplicate HEPA vacuum systems, which are each to consist of the following major components:

Each system is to include a  48 inches long by 30 inches deep work station that is to be located as shown on the drawing.  Each  workstation is to include a book cleaning device as well as a vacuum hose with the necessary valves so that either the book cleaning device or the vacuum hose can be used. The vacuum hoses are to be equipped with soft brushes of different types and shapes that are safe, compatible with, and useful for book cleaning operations. Brushes are to be easily removed and exchanged with new  brushes as they become worn.

Dust canisters are to be located on the floor level near the turbines.  The two vacuum lines shall be installed from the turbines to the workstations located 25-35 feet away in a near-by room.  Exhaust from the vacuum generators will be filtered through a HEPA filter before emptying into the room.  Vacuum equipment shall be installed in accordance with approved drawings and must not encroach upon dedicated exit access-ways, aisles, or corridor or otherwise obstruct occupant egress.

Noise generated by the system must not exceed OSHA's action level (in dB) and local standards. The system should be a quiet system that minimizes impact on staff in the room while working with the vacuum cleaning system.  Heat build-up in work station area and room should be negligible.  Noise dampening materials shall not lead to heat build-up or provide access and maintenance problems.  The vendor shall provide the final operational decibel level at the work station and in the processing area and locker area next to the turbine room

Each bench is to be equipped with a horizontal slot with a horizontal set of brushes and a vertical slot with a vertical brush so covers and tops of books can be cleaned simultaneously.  By turning the books the equipment should be effective in cleaning all sides of the books.  The vacuum slots should maximize the flow of the dirt into the vacuum system, rather than falling onto the table, or elsewhere. The benches should have the capability of being adjusted easily by a crank or electrically from a height of 30" to 42" above the floor.

The vacuum lines at each workstation are to have adjustable bleed valves to allow for control of the amount of suction. The individual vacuum work stations are to be equipped with suction gauges mounted on the hose connections.  There are to be individual low voltage controls at each workstation to actuate its vacuum generator.

2.2 SYSTEM OPERATION

The operator will place a container of books measuring 21" x 15" x 12" high on one side of the 48" wide bench and a similar empty container on the other side of the bench.  The operator will then move books from the filled container to the work cleaning station and then to the empty container.  When the full container has been emptied the container is to be cleaned with the vacuum hose and moved to the opposite side of the bench to become the container to be filled. The hose at the workstation is primarily intended for cleaning containers from which the dirty books have been removed although the hose may also be used for cleaning of books and other items.  The hose should be counter weighted to aid in preventing ergonomic problems.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered F05604-02-R-0017.  Numbered notes 1 and 26 apply.  While the action being advertised is likely to occur, the amount of information available for publication at this time is limited. The solicitation, when issued, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not anticipated at this time that the acquisition will be commercial (FAR Part 12).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.    

The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB CO seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal services in support of the mission of the 21st Communications Squadron, Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado. These services include support of operations, maintenance and management of the Peterson complex Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) to include unclassified and Multi-level Secure System (MLS) and classified network support, secure dial-in services (e.g., Virtual Private Networking), wireless services, network management, system administration, trouble ticketing (e.g., Remedy ARS), Information Assurance and security, configuration management and control, Internet and Intranet, hardware and software maintenance (to include Defense Messaging System (DMS) and others), help desk services and engineering and technical support to the 21ST Communications Squadron.  Work includes integration and expansion of the Peterson Air Force Base Network  (LAN and WAN) as well as assistance to the Air Force and DoD civilian personnel in the areas of responsibility under the statement of work.  The potential exists for some services to migrate off of this requirement after contract award due to consolidations efforts at the Major Command (MAJCOM) level.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for the New US Land Port of Entry (Port) at Massena, NY, in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  GSA Northeast and Caribbean Region, Solicitation No. GS-02P-02-DTC-0020(N).  This project consists of the demolition and replacement of the existing US Border Station (Port) at Massena, NY with a new Port facility.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction, and infrastructure improvements.  As a gateway to the United States, the Port must efficiently process traffic demands and operational requirements, while maintaining adequate safety for the staff and security of the border.  An appropriate Port design must holistically unify all program components into a distinguished and businesslike image reflecting the official status and serious law enforcement functions of the Port.  The new Port, over existing and newly acquired land, consists of the construction of new commercial vehicle queuing, parking, and inspection areas.  Additionally, the project includes, but is not limited to, the following: construction of a new secondary inspection warehouse and office buildings for commercial cargo; new export control building with inspection booths; infrastructure for private broker offices; new construction of the main administration building including offices above the primary passenger vehicle inspection booths; primary and secondary inspection plazas, and warehouse / garage facilities; demolition of existing structures and site features; temporary facilities to accommodate uninterrupted facility operations; extensive site work; and security enhancements.  The gross area of all existing buildings is approximately 1,402 m2.  The new expanded facility will contain a gross area of approximately 3,145 m2, and 80 outside parking spaces.  The estimated total cost of the expanded facility ranges between $13,000,000 and $14,500,000. The Design responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, program requirements, site development, transportation engineering, infrastructure improvements, demolition, civil, structural, interior construction, plumbing, HVAC, vertical transportation, fire protection, electrical system, lighting and power, sustainable features, and special systems (emergency generator, UPS, security, surveillance, communication and data system, energy management system).  The project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities, as well as, specific tenant-agency security requirements. The existing facilities contain hazardous material requiring abatement.  The Scope of AE Services under this Firm Fixed Price Contract includes, but is not limited to: Predesign survey of existing conditions, operational analysis, programming studies; presentations to client; energy conservation analyses; development of housing plans, phasing and support for the relocation of the existing operations and occupants into temporary space, complete architectural and engineering design, preparation of specifications, CADD drawings, scheduling, value engineering, partnering, cost estimating, construction phasing and space planning, interior design, optional post construction contract services (PCCS), optional as-built drawings, optional construction phase A-E inspection services and other related services.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A-E Firms / Lead Designers interested in contracting of this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have a contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the facilities' architecture.  The A-E Firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction documents. In developing the project team required for Stage II, A-E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the State of New York, excluding specialty consultants.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expenses, or computer hookups for the prime firm or any consultants.  If the A-E Firm is comprised of a partnership, corporation or other legal entity permitted by law to practice architecture or engineering, a complete description of the proposed internal responsibilities of the components must be included in both the Stage I and Stage II submittals.  This entity must be in place at time of contract award.
The A-E selection will be completed in THREE stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested A-E Firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A-E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2" x 11" format.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the A-E Firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and Standard Form 254 (Architect Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project), which must be dated not more than twelve (12) months before the date of this synopsis.  Identification of major consultant firms is required at this stage.  An A-E Evaluation Panel will evaluate the submission based on the following criteria: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN [35%].  The A-E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.

A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan, building section, and site plan.  Each project shall demonstrate architectural design accomplishments with an emphasis on transportation engineering.  A minimum of two projects shall demonstrate civil engineering and/or multi-building design accomplishments.  The narrative shall also address how site constraints were satisfied by the design.  (2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT [25%].  In the Lead Designer's words (maximum of two typewritten pages), state overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply for this type of project.  (3) LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE [15%].  Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts on similar projects.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. (4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO [25%].  Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the past ten years.  Narratives shall include a discussion of design challenges and resolutions. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition etc. demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address her/his participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private-sector peer, and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. The Board will establish a short list of three to six A-E Firms.  For STAGE II, the short listed A-E Firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants.  In this stage the entire project team, including the A-E Firms selected in the first stage, their designated lead designers and ALL the consultants who will work on the project, will be evaluated.  The A-E Firms will submit Standard Forms 254 and 255's which reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  A brief period, no longer than 14 calendar days, will be provided for the A-E firms to establish full project teams. The A-E Evaluation Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A-E Evaluation Board.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings to determine the A-E Firms that will be invited to participate in Stage III.  A minimum of three A-E Firms will be invited to participate in Stage III and will be further evaluated by an anonymous design competition, judged by a jury of independent design professionals.  The purpose of the design competition is to further evaluate the A-E's qualifications for this project by evaluating the design merits of each designer's "vision" for this specific project.  The design competition proposals will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A-E Firms.  The designer's "vision" will weigh substantially in the final A-E Team selection by GSA.  The submitted design concepts become the property of the Government and may or may not be the basis, whole or in part, for the development of the final facility / building design.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52.219-19).  This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  Before award of the contract, the A-E (if not a small business of $4,000,000.00 gross average sales receipts for the past three years), shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.

<SUBJECT>A -- Targets and Countermeasures Acquisition Strategy - Industry Day
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency, Targets and Countermeasures (MDA TC) Program Office intends to select a prime contractor responsible to the Government for providing target systems for testing the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and its  elements.  "Target systems" refers to all necessary components of a target such as boosters, reentry vehicles and payloads such as countermeasures, instrumentation and sensor packages.  The prime contractor will be responsible for planning and executing all aspects of the BMDS targets program to include, but not limited to, systems engineering and integration, advanced concepts and new development, product acquisition, range integration and launch services, logistics support, and system-wide business operations and program management.

To move towards that selection TC will conduct an Industry Day on Wednesday July 24, 2002 at the Holiday Inn located at 1900 North Fort Myer Drive, Arlington, VA 22209.  The Industry Day briefings will be conducted at the unclassified level.

The purposes of this Industry Day are to provide an overview of MDA TC requirements, to discuss its milestone schedule for contract award and to provide a detailed discussion of its major acquisition strategy objectives.  Those objectives are 1) To provide system level management of target systems through an integrating prime contractor, 2) To understand and manage target acquisition cycle time drivers and constraints - further to set cycle time goals according to need/demand and to balance corresponding investment initiatives by affordable business case analysis.  Accordingly, cycle time goals may vary uniquely by targets system, major components and subsystems and 3) To emphasize and contain program costs, set portfolio wide investment priorities and time phased investment strategies in order to manage total acquisition costs and to stimulate creative cost reducing initiatives.

To clarify the desired point of departure for prime management of the targets system, the following additional objectives are set: 1) Implement a single organization and management structure (to include involvement of Government and National Labs) for executing all aspects of the BMDS Targets and Countermeasures Program, 2) Create a comprehensive systems engineering activity to span all technical needs of the BMDS target system.  Organize to perform analyses and assess trade-space alternatives for areas to include: enhanced target systems capability, increased asset flexibility/adaptability, improved availability cycle time, and balanced affordability, 3) Develop transition plans that describe the actions required to assume management and execution responsibility of ongoing and future target systems activity to include full development of associated technical, cost, risk and schedule implications, and 4) Define and establish the necessary business/contract structure and product execution work flow that best assures workforce and critical skill-mix retention throughout the period of performance to include necessary/special incentive arrangements for success.

All companies with a capability and interest in meeting all or part of MDA TC requirements are invited to participate.  Foreign firms may attend the Industry Day, but are advised they may be precluded from proposing.

Companies must register to attend this Industry day and may be represented by up to four people.  To provide an opportunity for companies to more fully communicate about issues thy feel may be unique to them, one-on-one meetings will be scheduled to follow the general meeting.

To register and, if interested, to schedule a one-on-one meeting, please e-mail Mr. Patrick Linehan at Patrick.Linehan-contractor@mda.osd.mil and provide your company name, the names of planned attendees (up to four), and the name, e-mail address and phone number of your company point of contact for this event.

The Holiday Inn on North Fort Myer Drive is accessible from the Rosslyn Metro station.  Parking at the hotel is also available.  Directions and additional information about the hotel are available from the Holiday Inn at (703) 807-2000.
