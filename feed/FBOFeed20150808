<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Structural Biology Unit (SBU) at the NIDA IRP was established for the purpose of developing new technology and methods to analyze and measure biomolecules (drugs, lipids, peptides, and proteins). A key component of this research to identify biomarkers for long-time drug abuse and other disease models in order to understand the underlying biochemistry mechanism which will enable better medical treatment. Additionally, the tracking and measurement of drugs of abuse in biological matrices such as tissue and blood will allow for better understanding on the mode of operation for drugs of abuse in the body. To accomplish these goals, the SBU uses mass spectrometry specifically, ion mobility, MALDI, and Electrospray mass spectrometry.</span></p>

This acquisition is required to ensure high quality performance to support research of neurobiological mechanisms of drug addiction.The vendor shall improve mass resolution to over 5,000 at m/z 760 by providing new ion optics and new reflection grids for the mass spectrometer. This represents an almost a three-fold increase from the current mass resolution of 2,000.</span></p>

Therefore, this system will be integrated within the NIDA IRP&rsquo;s behavioral and imaging laboratory capabilities in order to obtain neurobiological behavioral correlates measures at the cellular level. This system will be necessary for extending these correlates to causal associations.<strong></strong></span></p>

Specifically, the Omniplex Data Acquisition Systems is unique in that is comprises a highly integrated system for simultaneous neural recordings, sophisticated video monitoring, and precise optogenetic control. Using this system one can measure local field potentials, observe and record behaviors (in 3 dimensions concurrently) and control optogenetic stimulation as a function of the recorded behavior all at the same time. This type of integrated system is the only piece of equipment commercially available that will allow concurrent assessment of both behavior and neural function and also control behavior and neural activity via optogenetic stimulation all at the same time, which is imperative to addressing the research aims of NIDA IRP&rsquo;s projects.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
506-15-3-1375-0123	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$130,000 Base Year, Plus One Option Year
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Payment to the Children's Research Institute for the Collaborator, Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang. This work is funded as a VA RR&D award as a collaborative project between Dr. Parent's Laboratory located here at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor and Dr. Zhu's and Dr. Wang laboratory currently located at the Children's Research Institute in Washington DC.  The VA peer review recognized the unique capabilities of both of these laboratories and the resources they have generated, which led to the origin of the funding of the grant.  Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang remain the key personnel on the grant and his contribution is required for successful completion of the studies.  Specifically, Dr. Yuan Zhu and his laboratory will use multiple genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to study the role of a cell death gene in adult neurogenesis (birth of brain cells) and brain repair after injury.  These studies will complement and inform similar mouse studies using stroke model that will be performed in the Dr. Parent's laboratory at the VA in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang are needed in a Collaborator role to continue work on the grant.  The work represents an ongoing collaboration funded by the VA RR&D mechanism to support experiments conducted collaboratively by these two researchers and their laboratories.  Dr. Parent works at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System.  Dr. Zhu recently moved from the University of Michigan to the Children's National Healthcare System located in Washington DC where he is Scientific Director and Chair of the Gilbert Family Neurofibromatosis Institute.  These experiments rely upon unique resources (specific genetic mouse models) generated by Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang with his laboratory that we are using in Dr. Parent's laboratory here at the VA.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Dr. Parent (VA Staff) started this collaboration with Dr. Zhu while Dr. Zhu was working at the University of Michigan and they have shared GEM lines and other resources. Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang are the only ones who can provide these collaborative efforts for the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System Research Department, his expertise and resources are required for this grant study.  Moreover, the VA RR&D grant award was funded specifically for Dr. Parent (VA Staff) and Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang with their individual laboratories to work together to complete the proposed studies/grant.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
This work does not involve "commercial" product but instead is intellectual property and resources involving a collaboration of Dr. Zhu and Dr. Wang (Children's Research Institute) with our VA Researcher, Dr. Parent and their laboratories.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
