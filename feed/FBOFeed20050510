To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. 
Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.   Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Likewise, proposals that are the integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of 12 to 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. 
This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  
TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO
This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.  Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason, white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See below)

New approaches for training individuals and teams, including embedded training and simulation;
Understanding and improving team performance; and
Understanding and improving individual performance and individual and group behavior.
Special Focus Areas
From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Addenda will have deadlines for submission of white papers and proposals that are different from the deadline in this BAA.  Under Addenda, the technical content for a submission as well as the overall structure of the proposed effort may also differ.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  
Other Technical Areas
Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of DSO and are likely to be rejected.  
WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their proposal to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  Proposers may recommend a program manager to review their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO web site.
A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a white paper document in either Word or PDF format.  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA05-19@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note: if the website is not used then the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will be informed of receipt of the white paper, provided a log number and given both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a formal proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Please note, this recommendation and any additional feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

<DESC>The US Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) located in Cambridge Massachusetts plans to procure sole source with Information Handling Services.  Market research shows that Information Handling Service is the only supplier of the specific regulatory specification and standard documents currently required to be consolidated.  The Volpe Center is tasked to acquire, implement, and manage the electronic library and subscription of required specifications and standards for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Office (PHMSA).  The PHMSA State Program electronic distribution of regulatory specifications and standards data was a project started in 2001 by the Office  of Pipeline Safety.  The electronic distribution of regulatory data and industry standards is one of the steps OPS has taken and continues to provide to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of inspection and enforcement activities.  The goals of this project are: (1) to provide consolidated network access to the regulatory data electronically; (2) to ensure the regulatory data is up to date; and (3) minimize field inspectors’ time in locating the appropriate regulatory information.  These regulatory specifications and standards are published from many different sources including public, private and non-profit organizations.  Due to the multiple sources, it is difficult for OPS and the SPP to keep a complete set of pertinent standards up-to-date and in a format that can be electronical ly cross-referenced.  Without pipeline electronic industry standards, OPS and the SPP will not be able to efficiently perform mission essential regulatory functions and inspection services.  The Custom Collection Intraspex network service, a proprietary server, will be provided as a multi-site subscription. This service will be provided on an annual subscription basis and the system will be updated daily.  This procurement will be conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  The NAICS Code is 518112.

<RESPDATE>052505
<ARCHDATE>08252005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Kathleen Regan, Contracting Officer, 617-494-3485
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, with Transportation Systems Center (TRC) Inc., located in East Liberty, OH.  The Volpe Center, in support of the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to procure services to collect data describing vehicle responses during dynamic rollover tests.  Approximately forty (40) rollover tests will be conducted each year.  The period of performance for this contract will be four (4) years from date of award.  Phase I of the Rollover Test Program  (eighteen (18) rollover tests of model year 2004 vehicles) was carried out by the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), a Federal Research Center operated by NHTSA and located adjacent to and managed by TRC.  These tests and several years of development work were performed by VRTC/NHTSA to develop the test procedures and statistical model to predict the rollover risk of vehicles as a function of their geometric properties and whether they tip up when tested on this particular test surface.  This specialized facility, Vehicle Dynamics Area (VDA), was constructed to provide uniform pavement friction and a flat surface profile to a far greater degree than provided by ordinary highway techniques.  The quality of the test surface enables NHTSA’s dynamic rollover test to achieve the high lev el of test-to-test repeatability necessary for valid comparisons of vehicle performance.  Due to NHTSA staff located at VRTC being limited, it was necessary to utilize the private sector to conduct the test for the next phase of the rollover test program.  TRC was determined to be uniquely qualified, because they manage and lease this specialized property, and their personnel are based at the location of the test surface required to conduct the rollover tests.  TRC conducted Phase II (twenty-one (21)) rollover test of Model year 2004 vehicles) and Phase III (thirty-four (34)) rollover tests of model year 2005 vehicles) of the rollover test program.  It is necessary to test the vehicles from model year 2006 though 2009 on the same surface to assure that the rollover risk predictions are val id, that the comparisons between 2004 and 2005 model year vehicles that have already been rated and the ratings of future vehicles are valid, and that the 2004 and 2005 ratings can be carried over for subsequent production years of substantially identical vehicles.  Surface friction, microtexture, macrotexture and profile have a strong effect on whether vehicles tip up or not during the rollover test. The results of these rollover tests will be used to supply consumers with comparative ratings of the dynamic rollover resistance of vehicles from model years 2006 through 2009.  Government market research indicated that TRC is the only facility that has conducted tests such as those conducted on the VDA surface located at TRC.  The need for the Government to provide fair and consistent test r esult requires that an alternate facility be able to verify that it 1) could conduct the same tests and collect the same data; and 2) could reproduce the test results achieved at TRC VDA for a reasonable and representative range of vehicles, particularly those that barely tipped-up at the highest test speeds.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park NC, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center pursuant to U.S.C.253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This procurement is for five (5) additional subjects to participate in an existing Pilot Study to investigate micronucleated erythrocyte frequencies in infants exposed to nucleoside antiretroviral drugs in utero and for six weeks postnatally.  Two facilities, Duke University Medical Center and UNC-CH were hired to collect infant cord blood samples for NIEHS to analyze for chromosome damage.  The protocol called for blood samples from 10 mothers and their infants.  Five samples were to come from UNC and five from Duke.  Duke has completed their samples and has potential to easily obtain five additional samples.  UNC-CH and Duke University Medical Center were contracted initially because they were the only local facilities that could provide the samples needed in a timely manner because they were the only ones with approved protocols and available patient populations identified.  They were also the only ones in close proximity to NIEHS and to each other.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of the date of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, an order will be placed with Duke University Medical Center.  The NAICS Code/Size is 561990/$6.0M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

Invoicing Instructions:   In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are t! o be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Marine Corps, has determined that Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) will be used to accomplish electronic invoicing.  Introduction:  Wide Area Work Flow is a web-based invoicing and acceptance system that enables Vendors (Contractors) to submit their invoices electronically to the receiver of the supplies or services.  The receiver receives an email notification and then can log in and perform the necessary acceptance requirements.  Once the acceptance portion is completed, the invoice and acceptance are forwarded to DFAS for processing.   Benefits:  This paperless system prompts the receiver to perform the acceptance functions, an area that has traditionally been the weak link in the invoice processing chain.  Invoices and acceptance functions can be tracked on line without further correspondence. Registration:  Vendors must register at:  https://wawf.eb.mil A “How To” Guide exists at: http://www.disa.mil/acq/wawf/guide.doc Tutorial:  A tutorial for using WAWF is available at: http://www.wawftraining.com For first-time users:  The “E-Business Point of Contact” listed in your company’s profile in CCR must contact the DISA Helpdesk to register your CAGE (BINCs) Code.  The phone number for the help desk is 866 618-5988. Information required for submitting invoices electronically: 1)	CAGE Code:  Commercial And Government Entity Code (note: the name is being changed to a “BINCs” Code) – Assigned when a vendor registers in Central Contractor Registration. 2)	Contract Number:  This number appears in block #2 of the SF1449.   3)	Order Number:   This number appears in block #4 of the SF1449.  It may be blank.  Normally much of the information from the contract will populate many of the fields.  If this does not occur, the required information can be obtained from the contract. 4)	Payment DoDAAC:  This can be obtained from block 18a, in the box marked “code” (i.e. M67443) 5)	Ship to code:  This number may appear in block 15, or appear in the shipping information.  Traditionally, but not always, it is the first six characters of the Requisition Number that generally appears in block #1 of the SF1449  (Note:  Generally the ship to code is NOT M00681). Vendors must use the “Combo” Invoice/Receiving Report when submitting invoices for supplies, and the 2 in 1 invoice when submitting invoices for services. Vendors are also encouraged to select the “send email notification” option prior to submitting invoices.  This alerts the receiver that they have an invoice to certify.

<DESC>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is competing a new contract for support services for interdisciplinary studies in clinical cancer genetics targeting families with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a model for familial cancer. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. Although the scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the Clinical Genetics Branch professional staff, the major activities of the contract provide:  1) nursing support including contacting family members, explaining the studies, enrolling family members, obtaining clinical information and records, requesting pathology slides for diagnosis confirmation, arranging for family members to be evaluated by CGB investigators in the Cancer Genetics Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center, performing phlebotomy, obtaining other biologic specimens as necessary, arranging and conducting field trips to evaluate family members, verifying information for the family registry database, maintaining tracking systems for data and biologic specimens, developing and providing educational materials for participants, and participating in genetic counseling and risk notification; 2) maintenance of a locked medical record room to which CGB investigators have immediate access; 3) development of coordination and liaison at a local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study; 4) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 5) hiring, training and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 6) identification of study subjects, including locating persons at risk of cancer and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 7) supervision and management of field operations; 8) collecting data (interviewing/record abstraction, biologic specimen collection and processing); 9) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 10) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.  The maintenance of a secure record room which allows CGB investigators access to the medical records within 15 minutes is a mandatory requirement. There is also a mandatory requirement of the capability of nearly daily face to face meetings with the CGB staff. It is anticipated that one incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a period of five years, with a required total level of effort of 53,000 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about May 31, 2005 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. The RFP may be accessed via the NCI Research Contract Branch (RCB) website: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ under “Current Requests for Proposals”. Award of this project is anticipated by January 17, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NCI.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) to analyze the AN/AQS-20A hydrodynamic data in two configurations ((1) VSS and (2) EOID) from the MH-60S AN/AQS-20A WSIT CT and use it as an input data to correlate existing models and improve model validity.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  To accurately correlate and validate the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to modify the algorithm may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate model could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  NAIC! S Code 541330 applies.  SBA Size Standard:$4.0M.  FSC Code is AD24.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for engineering development and associated analysis activities within the areas of guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) systems, integrated avionics systems and autonomous flight operations systems. This work can be classified as (1) Space Shuttle Avionics Systems Development and Assessment, (2) International Space Station (ISS) Engineering Development and Assessment or (3) Avionics and GN&C Research and Technology Development for Advanced Space Systems.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Charles Stark Draper Laboratories, Inc. Draper is the only company to have provided this capability to JSC, beginning with the Apollo program and continuing through the Shuttle and ISS programs.  Draper has the in-house knowledge, unique skills, and critical capabilities required to provide GN&C analysis to enable the Government’s Certification of Flight Readiness for both Shuttle and ISS.  Draper provides crucial insight in its support of both the NASA System Expert (NSE) for Shuttle On-orbit Flight Control and the ISS GN&C System Manager in providing flight rationale for each Shuttle/ISS assembly flight.  Company unique skills enable Draper to provide flight control system design and analysis, flight control software development, reaction jet phase plane design and analysis, flexible structure dynamics analysis, and controller–structure interaction analysis.  Successful execution of this work is dependent upon Draper’s extensive experience and expertise in the Shuttle flight control system, the ISS flight control system, the ISS Russian flight control system, Shuttle flight software development process, Shuttle real-time mission support, and all the associated tools required to perform those analyses.  Flight control analyses, by its very nature, is vehicle dependent.  Therefore, it requires Draper’s extensive knowledge of detailed vehicle parameters and characteristics and experienced engineering judgment which is often called upon in order to successfully develop and analyze vehicle control systems.  Draper personnel have the specific historical knowledge as well as the broad control system experience necessary to perform this analysis.	 Over the life of the program, Draper has been responsible for developing flight-to-flight software parameters, processing and evaluating software changes, providing real-time mission support, and in-flight anomaly resolution.  Due to the importance of these capabilities, the Shuttle Program has, on numerous occasions, elected not to transition this responsibility to the prime contractor, Boeing, because of the recognized unique capabilities that Draper retains. For the ISS Program, Draper assesses the dynamics and control of the ISS for all assembly configurations and aides in the development of flight rationale for the Certificate of Flight Readiness.  Draper is skilled in providing flight control system assessment of both the prime contractor (Boeing) and the Russian GN&C systems.  The ISS represents the largest and most complex space structure ever built.  The complexity of its flexible dynamic characteristics represents an unprecedented challenge.	The predominant portion of the tools required to perform this and similar types of analysis were developed by Draper.  Draper has the historical knowledge required to do this work efficiently, effectively, and safely due to its experience in fully understanding all the complex mathematical models required to perform the analysis.  Draper is a cutting edge organization working at the leading edge of GN&C technology.  This technology, specifically work in Micro Electro Mechanical (MEMS) devices, autonomous flight systems, advanced flight control, and advanced integrated GN&C systems, is critical for the Government to support the Exploration activities. Draper has a history of supplying NASA with a MEMS rate gyro to the AERCam project.	This is currently the only MEMS gyro in existence that can meet NASA’s stringent level of performance requirements to accommodate the harsh conditions found in the environment of outer space.  In the area of autonomous flight systems, Draper is responsible for providing the predominant portion of groundbreaking work that went into the Shuttle Abort Flight Management (SAFM) software, as part of the Shuttle’s Cockpit Upgrades Program.	SAFM represents the first steps toward more autonomous systems that will be required for the Exploration Initiative.  Lastly, Draper is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Timeliner software that is currently being used on ISS and is crucial in the automation of crew and ground procedures.   Draper is the only source available in the case of this follow-on contract that has the unique experience and capabilities required for the continued provision of highly specialized services which are critical to the effective, efficient, and safe operation of space flight and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Significant prohibitive barriers, inclusive of an extensive and costly transition period, exist to a full and open competition resulting in an award to a non-incumbent.	The non-incumbent would be required to become certified for all of the incumbent’s unique processes, procedures, tools, and capabilities, which are critical and essential elements in the successful performance of this scope of work.  The incumbent workforce is certified to develop flight software parameters and conduct analysis that leads directly to flight readiness statements.  Requirements for transition to a non-incumbent would require that a non-incumbent acquire a level of knowledge similar to that of Draper.  A non-incumbent would be required to demonstrate a level of knowledge and skill necessary to provide GN&C analysis to enable the Government’s safe Certification of Flight Readiness for both Shuttle and ISS.  This would be a lengthy process that could impede NASA’s ability to meet a launch schedule.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>BINARY ENERGY MANAGEMENT Program (BEM), SOL BAA05-19 Addendum 5, Due:  June 23, 2005

POC: Dr. Rosemarie Szostak, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4588, Email: BAA05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519.

PROGRAM GOALS:

This BAA request proposals for enabling technologies for high explosive systems such that the system can be switched from a state that is completely unreactive (will not detonate) to a fully sensitive energetic system.  The scheme used to facilitate the mechanism of transition cannot be compromised, i.e. the scheme by which the system is switched requires an external action without which the system will remain inert.  It is also important that the amount of energy that the energetic system can release is not diluted to achieve the inert state.  The ability to achieve a continuum of performance between an inert and a sensitive state is desirable but not required.

It is not the intent of the DARPA Program to develop high explosive warheads through this BAA.  Rather, this program will demonstrate enabling technologies required for ultimate development of such systems.  Therefore, solutions proposed in response to this BAA must be consistent with size/weight/volume requirements of existing warheads.

BACKGROUND:

Sensitivity of energetic materials to unexpected impact, friction, shock waves, and thermal loading is a critical military issue.  This concern has led to the formulation of new safety requirements for munitions and the desire for the development of insensitive munitions (IM).  The requirements for safety are described in Title 10 US Code, Chapter 14, Section 2389 and in DoD Directive 5000.1.  Present IM development has focused on a combination of less sensitive energetic fill formulations, mitigation techniques and packaging.  Though more insensitive then their predecessors, the present energetic fill formulations fall far short of the goal of being totally insensitive.  These less sensitive formulations also lack the properties of the prior sensitive energetic material [total energy content, pressure pulse, and detonation velocity].  The present approach to achieve insensitivity of fill formulations relies on dilution of the energetic component relative to the binding resulting in less desirable total energy content, pressure and detonation velocity upon initiation.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

The objective of this two phase program will be to develop a system containing an energetic fill and a control scheme that can demonstrate a mechanism by which the energetic fill can be switched between completely insensitive mode and full energy release.  This control scheme cannot be compromised and the output of energy when the system is detonated cannot be diluted to obtain insensitivity.  An ideal system for this program is defined as having a detonation effectiveness equivalent to or exceeding CL-20 (Edet = 317 kcal/cc, Pcj = 420 kbar) In Phase I (not to exceed 12 months) performers will demonstrate at the laboratory bread-board level the end states of their system that is 1) the insensitive mode (state) and 2) full energy release mode and the mechanism by which these modes can be switched.  Energy release in Phase I need not be optimized but should constitute at least 70 percent release of the total energy (Edet and Pcj).  In Phase II the performers will integrate the scheme used to achieve the switching mechanism with the fill and optimize energy release for maximum energy output (Edet and Pcj).  Performers will also demonstrate that the system (fill and switching scheme) cannot be compromised under the requirements for insensitive munitions, i.e., the system will not detonate under the specific assaults of cook-off, penetration, and sympathetic detonation.

Phase I Program Requirements—Laboratory bread-board demonstration of principle.

The insensitivity and energy content of the fill and the mechanism for switching or dialing between insensitive to sensitive will be demonsthing in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation. We encourage the submission of white papers and proposals that provide solutions to one or both of the challenge problem variations.  It is anticipated that to provide these solutions, research efforts will have to address one or more of the following areas: 
1.	New mathematical methods that will enable the development of nonlinear multiscale spatiotemporal models of physical systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics.  We are specifically encouraging efforts that provide a methodology for the design of experiments in coupled nonlinear systems to support the development of models and which can characterize the effects of unmodeled dynamics upon the outputs of the model.  We strongly discourage methods that do not exhibit linear scaling with the number of parameters in the model.
2.	New methods that reduce the computational complexity of nonlinear models  resulting in a nonlinear model with less complex dynamics and for which the impact of reducing the model can be quantified by guaranteeing the performance of the system as well as providing bounds on the performance of the system as a result of simplifying the model.
3.	We are also interested in computational strategies that will minimize the computational costs associated with the evaluation of a nonlinear model while maintaining an appropriate precision in control or optimization applications. 
4.	Analysis methods and computational techniques that enable the propagation of uncertainty through coupled nonlinear systems.  In particular these new methods must be capable of accounting for branching in the dynamics, accounting for non-Gaussian probability distributions associated with parameters of the models, sensor noise, and initial conditions.
5.	New numerical methods for the estimate of the probability distribution function for the outputs of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems on multiple spatiotemporal scales that are faster and more computationally efficient than Monte-Carlo simulation or particle filter methods for a given non-Gaussian distribution of input parameters, model uncertainty, and reduction of the dynamics.
6.	Methods to control and, if required, optimize the performance of large federated nonlinear systems with dynamics on multiple spatiotemporal scales.

We strongly discourage white papers and proposals that rely on methods that attempt to linearize the dynamics and then apply established methods such as a Kalman Filter.  We are also discouraging white papers and proposals that attempt to solve the challenge problems by application of known nonlinear control methods and that do not involve the development of new mathematical methods. 

RUM is envisioned as a three-phase program that leads to the solution of the challenge problem by developing new methods for the solution of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems in the face of uncertainty.  Each phase of RUM will consist of a twelve-month period of performance.  In the first twelve-month phase of RUM, the focus will be the development of new methods focused upon the challenge problem variants.  At the conclusion of the first phase we expect to test the new methods by simplifying the challenge problem to a large coupled system that has linear dynamics and Gaussian distributions associated with the probability distribution functions of all uncertainties.  At the conclusion of Phase 1 the efficacy of the new methods will be verified by comparing their predicted results against standard techniques for these problems.  The second twelve-month phase may include a down-select of Phase 1 efforts.  The down-selection criteria may include success in the verification process described above.  The focus of Phase 2 will be in refining and demonstrating that the new methods developed for the challenge problem can be applied to the special case of a large linear system with non-Gaussian distributions of input parameters and produce results that are consistent with Monte Carlo or particle filtering methods but at reduced computational costs.  The final phase will consist of 12 months and may include another down-select based partially upon success in verifying performance at the conclusion of Phase 2.  During the third phase, the methods developed will be applied to the challenge problems leading to a design with performance guarantees in the presence of uncertainty, demonstration of design of experiments to produce complex nonlinear models, and the application of the design of experiments methodology to produce reduced complexity models whose effect upon the design can be assessed in the face of sensor errors and uncertainty in initial conditions.  Authors of white papers and proposals may include an optional task in which the system design can be tested experimentally.

WHITE PAPER REQUIREMENTS.  White papers must lead to a solution of either variant of the challenge problem and the solution must be based upon the development and application of new mathematics.  We strongly discourage white papers that focus on the design of new sensors, data collection efforts, linearization of the system, or application of known nonlinear control methodologies to address the challenge problem.  We are also strongly discouraging white papers and proposals that focus on experimentally determining conditions that lead to a solution of the challenge problem.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenge problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas:
1.	A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  The vision for the program should be long term and may exceed the period of performance while the goals and deliverables should reflect the actual period of performance; 
2.	A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured. Intermediate milestones of approximately 12-month periods with demonstrable metrics of performance must be included for the proposed work; 
3.	A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline; and
4.	The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met. 
White papers must be received by 1600 ET March 22, 2005.  Please put the phrase “Robust Uncertainty Management” in the title of the white paper.  If the authors of white papers choose not to submit electronically, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Authors of white papers will be notified by April 22, 2005, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 ET May 23, 2005.

<DESC>WAVEFORMS FOR ACTIVE SENSING, SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 3, DUE: 4/25/05, 400pm ET, POC: Douglas Cochran, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 696-2287. Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/
DESCRIPTION
The Defense Sciences Office is soliciting innovative proposals to develop waveform design and scheduling methodologies for active sensing systems. Recent technological advances have enabled marked increases in radio-frequency (RF), optical, and acoustic transmitter agility.  The goal of this initiative is development of new waveform and waveform family designs, scheduling techniques, and design tools, based upon rigorous mathematical foundations, to exploit this agility in applications of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD).  Of particular interest are approaches that simultaneously utilize agility at the transmitter and adaptivity of receiver processing to fully exercise the: temporal, spatial, and spectral degrees of freedom entailed in modern and emerging DoD sensing applications.
This program is anticipated to be executed in two phases.  Phase I is expected to run for 15 months and will emphasize mathematical development of new approaches with validation through simulation and possibly laboratory demonstrations. Phase II is planned to run for 21 months and will entail refinement of the techniques developed in Phase I in conjunction with validation and demonstration in DoD-relevant testbed applications.  Proposals should address both program phases and should budget Phase II as an option.
Full proposals only are being accepted with the technical proposals being no more than twenty (20) pages, including cover sheet information and references. No addenda (e.g., reprints of published papers or technical reports) beyond the 20-page limit will be considered in the evaluation process.  Proposals must contain the following elements: (1) Explicit description of one or more DoD-relevant application scenarios around which the project will be focused; (2) Precise quantification of the performance improvements sought via exploitation of waveform agility in the context of the focus application or applications; (3) Concise enumeration of the research challenges entailed in attaining the desired performance improvements sought, the approaches to be used to address these challenges; and (4) Plans for measuring the performance of the new techniques in simulation, laboratory, and testbed environments.  One or more specific, quantitative milestones against which performance of the techniques developed will be benchmarked before the end of Phase I must be explicitly stated in the proposal. Similar milestones for the end of Phase II are also of interest, but these may be modified prior to the selection point for exercise of Phase II options based on insights gained in Phase I research.
Successful proposals will aim at achieving significant, quantifiable improvement over current sensing capabilities and will set forth integrated projects, including personnel and facilities, that comprehensively span basic mathematical development through testbed demonstration. Teaming of academic and industrial performers as well as partnership with DoD laboratories and other capable testbed demonstration facilities are encouraged to facilitate the proposal of integrated projects. Letters from DoD or other Government laboratories indicating interest in partnership in the proposed project, particularly in validation and demonstration aspects, may be appended to the proposal and will not count against the 20-page limit.
Full proposals are due no later than 4:00 pm ET, April 25, 2005.  Proposals submitted after this time may not be considered.  Please put the phrase “Waveforms for Active Sensing” in the title of the proposal to ensure proper routing. For details on proposal format and other aspects of full proposal submission, please see original FEDBIZOPS solicitation, BAA05-19, the text of which is availables also desirable.  

A critical component of a successful effort is a series of technology demonstrations that will occur regularly throughout the two year work period.  These demonstrations will show clear progress toward the goal of delivering a mature arm prosthesis system that meets the requirements for an FDA IND at the end of the two year research and development period.  The series will culminate in a demonstration of the complete functional arm system at the conclusion of the project.  

The formation of multidisciplinary teams with an overall system integrator as the lead institution is essential for effective program planning and execution.  Proposals must describe plans to address the technical, commercial, and regulatory issues pertinent to integration of state of the art technologies into a new medical device.  The emphasis of this two year effort is on the technical aspects of the upper arm prosthesis system.  Commercial development and regulatory approval plans will be used to evaluate the ability of the proposers to ultimately deliver a prosthetic limb that will be widely available to the amputee community.  An optional third year of effort should be proposed for the purpose of performing an early clinical trial.  Only exceptionally successful programs will be considered for support in the third year.  

Each proposal should explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above; include at least five specific, quantitative 12 month technical objectives that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals; and include clear intellectual property arrangements, commercialization plans and transition paths.  Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Proposed efforts should not exceed 24 months plus an optional third year for early clinical trials.  If multiple awards are made a down-selection may occur after 12 months based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.

Only full proposals are being accepted under this addendum.  Proposals shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA05-19 (Parts 1 & 2) of 8 Feb, 2005 (http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm).  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE TO THE ADDRESS SHOWN BELOW NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM ET 1 JUNE 2005.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.  Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BA05-19.  Please refer to the original FedBizOpps announcement for BAA 05-19 (Parts 1 and 2) for general administrative questions.

Proposals involving human use that are selected for funding will be required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a Federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a Federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

Description

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving proposals for research, development and proof-of-concept demonstrations of efficient, integrated plasma generating structures (IPGS) capable of producing ionized air on or near surfaces.  The IPGS program seeks to integrate structural/mechanical attributes, such as load bearing structures, together with plasma generation in the same system.  It also aims to provide these features at low weight, low volume with a high level or unique performance, flexibility in design, reduced complexity and high reliability.  The program intends to develop materials, devices and integrated systems that provide efficient plasma generation that can be spatially and temporally modulated near surfaces in quiescent or moving air, over a wide range of temperatures, ranging from very cold to very hot.  The specific objectives of this program are 1) the development and demonstration of novel, efficient plasma generating materials systems where volume, weight and power are severe constraints; 2) the establishment of metrics, rules and tools for selection, design and operation; and 3) the fabrication of demonstration devices for testing to clearly demonstrate their value to the Department of Defense (DoD). 

Project Requirements

All proposed projects must result in efficient devices and structures in engineering-compatible time-frames and develop broadly applicable approaches, rules and tools for design and use of the devices in a broad range of environments.  Proposals must explicitly identify the unique features of the plasma generation device or structure, compared to conventional devices and clearly identify a specific set of metrics that addresses the intent of the proposed program.    Proposers must clearly describe and define a two phase program lasting no more than three years; Phase I should not exceed fifteen (15) months and must have specific, quantitative go/no-go milestones to be achieved before beginning Phase II.  Integrated, multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts or teaming arrangements among industry, universities, federal laboratories and military users are encouraged.  Since the emphasis of the program is on the development of a system that includes efficient, light-weight, low volume plasma generation devices and material systems, structures composed of discrete components that require extensive, heavy, externally supplied electrical power or communication, or command and control support (i.e., complex arrangements of sensors, actuators and control systems) are not of interest and will not be considered. 

Format and Content of Full Proposals

Proposals must follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa05-19pt2.html.  Technical proposals must cover the following eight topics:  1) the ultimate goal (operation, environment, etc.) and attributes of the proposed devices and material system, including the novelty and advantages; 2) the essence of the device, material or structure, clearly identifying its functions and the underlying (postulated) operative physical mechanisms; 3) the uniqueness of the idea and its advantages over the state-of-the-art; 4) the overall technical approach, including key challenges and how and when they will be addressed; 5) specific and quantitative Phase I and II milestones needed to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program; 6) the potential for producing the materials devices or structures (one-of-a-kind demonstrations that cannot be made into a practical structure will not be acceptable); 7rated.

1.  Insensitivity Testing and Requirements:

Small scale (laboratory scale) Insensitive Munitions (IM) tests for cook-off, bullet/fragment penetration and shape charge impact will be used to determine insensitivity using the procedures described in NAVSEA INSTRUCTION 8020.5C, of 05 May 2000.  Enclosure (3) of NAVSEA INSTRUCTION 8020.5C provides detailed procedures to be followed in laboratory testing for insensitivity.  Requirements are (1) Fast and slow cook-off:  No reaction more severe than controlled burning (i.e., the rate of combustion is constant).  (2) Bullet/fragment penetration:  Unreactive or no response more severe than controlled burning.  (3) Shape charge impact:  No reaction more severe than controlled burning.  (4) Sympathetic detonation:  No detonation from 25 grams of explosive system energetic material (as configured in the explosive system) at the same distance at which 25 grams of TATB is detonated by 25 grams of C-4 (initiator explosive).

2.  Switching Mechanism:

Successfully demonstrate in laboratory scale experiments a mechanism to transition or dial from insensitive state to state where energy release (detonation) is achieved.

3.  Full Energy Release and Requirement:

Demonstrate the end state of the system will result in detonation with at least the following characteristics:  The explosive energetic system must demonstrate at least 70 percent of the detonation effectiveness of the calculated output. 

Phase II Program Requirements—Larger scale, integrated components system demonstration.

The system for Phase II is defined as the optimization of the system components demonstrated in Phase I such that upon integration of the components the size, weight and volume of the system  are commensurate  with existing warheads while still meeting the specific metrics of Phase I.

NEUROTECHNOLOGY FOR INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS (NIA), SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 1, DUE: 4/15/04. POC: Dr. Amy Kruse, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4338, Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519. 

PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: 
The Defense Research Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving innovative proposals to conduct research and development on neuroscience-based tools to aid intelligence analysts.  The vision for the Neurotechnology for Intelligence Analysts (NIA) program is to revolutionize the way that analysts handle intelligence imagery, increasing both the throughput of imagery to the analyst and accuracy of their assessments. 
Analysts are currently faced with an enormous volume of imagery, only a fraction of which can be processed or reviewed in a timely operational manner.  Unfortunately, computer-based target detection efforts have failed to yield the speed, flexibility and accuracy of the human visual system.  We hypothesize that the human visual system is still the best target detection apparatus currently in use and with the addition of neuroscience-based measurement capabilities it can surpass the throughput of the unaided human several-fold. 
Using electroencephalograpy (EEG), Thorpe et al (Nature, 1996) have described a fast signal in the brain associated with the early detection of targets within static imagery using a Rapid Sequential Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm.  This phenomenon suggests that it may be possible to extract target detection signals for complex imagery in real-time using non-invasive neurophysiological assessment tools to indicate the presence of targets significantly faster than waiting for overt indications.  

In order to transform this phenomenon into a capability for defense applications, DARPA is pursuing a 12 month Phase 1 effort to achieve the following technical goals:

1) Discover and characterize the neural signatures for target detection events in the human brain.  Imagery of interest:
	a) Static imagery
	b) Large/Broad Area imagery
	c) Video imagery
Phase 1 will concentrate on static imagery; however, proposals should consider the technical challenges necessary to uncover related signatures in broad area and video imagery.  Proposers may utilize any type of neurophysiological sensors (COTS or novel); however only fast signals, on the order of milliseconds, are of interest for this effort. 

2) Measure neural signatures in real-time for the on-line classification of target detection signals in the brain.  Proposers may utilize signal processing techniques already described, or suggest the development of novel processing algorithms; however, only single-trial (ie non-trial-averaged) methods are of interest.  

3) Demonstrate the measurement and classification of neural signals for target detection in real-time.  The Phase 1 goal demonstration is an image “triage” system in which subjects are rapidly shown static imagery, signals are classified in real time and the corresponding imagery shown is then sorted – based on the classification of the neural signatures – into sets of images that contain targets/regions of interest versus those that contain none.  

At the end of the 12 month Phase 1 effort a demonstration, as described, is expected. Phase 1 efforts will be evaluated on the technical goals as stated in 1)-3), and on performance goals including 1) the ability to increase the number of images shown to analysts over a constrained period of time (throughput)  2) the accuracy with which the triage systems are able to correctly categorize imagery based on the neural signatures (false positives and false negatives) as compared to a non-neurally-based triage baseline condition.

Based on the success of Phase 1, there is the potential for an 18 month Phase 2 effort to mature successful demonstrations into prototype systems for transition to operational use.  Proposers are invited, although not require) a list of participants and their contributions; and, 8) a chart showing Phase I and II tasks with quantitative milestones.  The cost proposal for resources required must be broken out by government fiscal year and task according to the general guidelines provided above.

In addition to the eight (8) categories described above, each proposal must:  1) include at least two specific and quantitative yearly objectives for each scientific/technical task that clearly demonstrate that the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal; 2) include clearly delineated intellectual property rights and material producability arrangements; and 3) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other activities planned to facilitate qualification of the device or system and increase its readiness for transition into DoD platforms.

Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements may be required periodically.  A final demonstration of a deliverable device or material system is required.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, teaming arrangements are highly encouraged.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Proposers may be required to brief their proposal to the DARPA Source Selection Committee.

To receive consideration under this addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 HOURS ET May 26, 2005.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA only.

<DESC>UUV POWER SYSTEMS, SOL BAA05-19, ADDENDUM 7, DUE 071505, 
POC: DR. VALERIE BROWNING, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 696-2314 or DR. LEO CHRISTODOULOU, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 696-2374, Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil, 
URL:  www.darpa.mil/dso.  Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in reviewing innovative research and development proposals on integrated, multifunctional power and energy storage technologies that will enable long duration missions for future Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) platforms.  The vision for the anticipated DARPA UUV Power initiative is to significantly increase the total transit distance and/or time on station for military UUV applications.  Achieving this vision will require a tightly integrated research and development program that pursues major performance breakthroughs in power generation, energy storage, and multifunctional materials technologies.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:  Current UUV platforms are deployed for a variety of commercial and military missions.  The time on station and/or transit distance for many of these missions is often compromised by the energy storage capacity of the overall UUV power delivery system.  For example, for many UUV applications, typical mission duration is measured in hours to perhaps a few days.  Based on these limitations and reasonable extrapolations for future advances in UUV power technologies, the Navy has drafted a UUV Master Plan that describes the anticipated capabilities for future UUV missions through FY 2016 and beyond.  A copy of the current UUV Master Plan can be found online at the following URL:  http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/technology/uuvmp.pdf.  The objective of the DARPA UUV Power Systems program is to explore high-risk, high-payoff technologies that are likely to be beyond the scope of projects that the Navy will consider under the current UUV Master Plan.  It is anticipated that, if successful, technologies developed under a DARPA UUV Power Systems program would enable missions that the Navy has yet to consider.  To meet this objective, DARPA is soliciting input from the research and development community on novel UUV power systems that have the potential for demonstrating energy densities in the range of 1000-1500 Watt-hours per liter (W-hr/l) to include power plant, fuel and oxidant storage, power conditioning, controls, monitoring devices, etc.  While DARPA does not desire a solution for a specific existing or anticipated future mission profile, some general guidelines regarding average power, peak power, mission duration, and available volume will be provided.  These values are given in the context of a “notional” UUV mission.  General performance targets for this notional mission are as follows:  a) average power for propulsion and payload should be in the 5-10 kW range; b) power plant should be capable of handling short duration (< 1 % of the overall duty cycle) to peak power levels in the 30-40 kW range; and c) overall mission duration > 30 days.  The maximum volume available to house the power plant and energy storage is estimated to be between 4000-5500 liters (width or diameter not to exceed ~1.8 m or 6 feet).  DARPA recognizes that achieving these energy densities presents a significant technical challenge in terms of both power generation and energy storage.  With this in mind, DARPA is particularly interested in reviewing proposals that incorporate “multifunctional” strategies in power generation and/or energy storage. Energy that can be stored in or extracted from the UUV structural components (bulkheads, hull, stiffeners, etc.) without compromise to their primary function should reduce the overall energy density burden of the primary energy storage and power plant systems.  Any proposed multifunctional approach should not impose a volume penalty.  The multifunctional energy storage and/or power generation materials and structures can be incorporated into any location in the entire UUV that would otherwise be dedicated to structural support (or other function) alone provided they do not require any additional volume.  Note that, for the purposes of this demonstration program, a UUV “hull” does not necessarily have to provide a pressure boundary, i.e., a flooded system is an acceptable approach if it meets the desired performance metrics.  The desired attributes for a UUV Power system also include, but are not limited to, the following:  a) neutral buoyancy—while there are no specific gravimetric targets for the overall power plant and/or energy storage system, proposers must describe a strategy for assuring that the overall UUV platform can achieve or nearly achieve neutral buoyancy; b) scalability—DARPA anticipates that, if warranted, a “demonstrator” platform will be chosen at some point during the course of the overall program.  At this point, final targets for average power, peak power, and energy density will be decided. These targets should be consistent with the range of values specified earlier in this BAA.  The demonstrator platform may be an existing submersible vessel or a newly designed platform incorporating features that exploit multifunctionality concepts.  In any case, it will be necessary for any candidate technology to be scalable to the specific mission and volumetric target values indicated above; and c) air independent—DARPA is specifically targeting technologies that can operate in an air independent environment.  While it is recognized that certain mission scenarios can accommodate periodic “snorkeling” events, the technologies of interest under this BAA must allow for continuous underwater operation for the full mission duration.  DARPA strongly encourages proposers to consider the potential benefits of an interdisciplinary “teamed” approach in developing their technical proposals.  While DARPA does not participate or provide direction in the formation of teams, in order to facilitate teaming opportunities, a Teaming Website has been established at the following URL:  https://www.sainc.com/UUVPowerTeaming/index.asp.  In addition, presentations from an informational, pre-BAA workshop on UUV Power Systems can be found at this website.  These presentations may contain useful information for those interested in submitting a proposal in response to this BAA.  DARPA reserves the option of funding all, some, none or only sections of proposals rather than entire efforts proposed.  Further, for any partially approved proposals, DARPA may suggest link-ups with other selected efforts in the program, if mutually acceptable to the parties concerned.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:  Only full proposals are being considered under this Addendum.  To receive consideration under this Addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 ET JULY 15, 2005, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this Addendum.  Proposers should submit proposals that describe a time phased technology development and demonstration program broken into the following phases:  a) Phase 1 (12 months):  Based on notional system designs, performers are to establish the feasibility of their design for meeting DARPA goals, identify the significant technology development challenges that need to be addressed in order to demonstrate their system concept, and initiate sufficient research and development efforts to provide “proof of concept” that these technical challenges could be overcome with additional time and resources.  With respect to multifunctional materials and structures the potential for producing these in engineering-compatible timeframes and facilities must be shown at the end of Phase 1 (one-of-a-kind demonstrations that cannot be made into a practical structure will not be acceptable); b) Phase 2 (18-24 months):  Based on initial Phase 1 feasibility demonstrations, performers should aggressively push the development of the sub-system technologies to a performance level commensurate with the anticipated requirements for a fully integrated system demonstration; and c) Phase 3 (18-24 months):  System level demonstration of a UUV power and energy storage system that targets the BAA objectives.  It is anticipated that a platform for demonstrating the final integrated system will be selected near the end of Phase 2.  While DARPA recognizes the increasing difficulty in accurately projecting Phase 2 and Phase 3 costs and/or level of effort, proposers are required to include their best estimates of Phase 2 and Phase 3 activities in both the Technical and Cost portions of their full proposals.  It is imperative that proposers clearly identify the anticipated quantitative milestones and go/no-go criteria for each phase.  Submersible vessels “modified or equipped for military purposes” are included in the U.S. Munitions List and are, therefore, subject to United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Proposers must communicate in their proposals an understanding of ITAR and assure that all team members are capable of complying with the ITAR and that they are willing to do so.  Full proposals should be formatted and submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in the original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA05-19 http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.  To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS:  Evaluation of proposals will be in accordance with BAA05-19.  For general administrative questions, please refer to the original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA05-19, of February 8, 2005.

<DESC>PROSTHESIS 2007, SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 4, DUE: 4:00 PM ET 6/1/05. POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO, Ph: 571-218-4674, Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519. 

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for research, development, system integration and demonstration of an upper extremity prosthetic.  The vision of the Prosthesis 2007 program is to leverage recent research advances in neural sensing, control systems, actuation, power storage and distribution, freeform manufacturing, neural control, microfabrication, sensory feedback, flexure and transmission design, signal processing, and information science to dramatically improve the capability of upper extremity prosthetic limbs beyond those that are currently available commercially.  This vision will be realized by increasing the range of motion, strength, endurance, and dexterity of upper extremity prosthetic devices.  The final product must be ready for human clinical trials including completed submission of an Investigational New Device (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 24 months.

The ultimate goal of this two year effort is to deliver a single prosthetic arm system that is suitable for transhumeral and shoulder disarticulation amputations.  The program is comprehensive and will deliver a prosthetic arm system in two years that is sufficiently mature to enter the appropriate approval processes for general medical use.  Maturity of the prosthetic will be demonstrated by completed submission of an IND application to the FDA by the end of 24 months.  Proposals that do not address the full integration of component technologies into an upper limb prosthesis or do not plan for the appropriate approval process and product commercialization are generally not of interest.  However, the development of enabling technologies of extraordinary promise may be considered for support.  DARPA has separately published BAA 05-26 Revolutionizing Prosthetics.  Prosthesis 2007 (BAA 05-19 Addendum 4) is focused on nearer term improvements in prosthetics capabilities.  Proposers are free to propose to both solicitations independently.

The technical goal of the program is to develop arm prostheses that significantly improve the ability of the arm amputee to perform the activities of daily living.  Design trades and technology choices may dictate that some of the desirable characteristics listed below are not simultaneously achievable, are unnecessary, or are not achievable in two years.  The guiding principle to be used when performing design trades is that the device should deliver the maximum capability possible for the activities of daily living within the two year time frame. Desirable characteristics of the upper arm prosthesis system include (1) inertial properties that match the lost limb including arm free swing capability, (2) local control, state sensing, and task-based mode shifting within the device to enable improved functionality, (3) simultaneous control of 3-5 joints, (4) fingertip force detection, (5) local hand grasp slip control, (6) elbow lift capability of up to 20 ft-lbs, (7) grip strength of up to 25 lbs, (8) wrist flexion strength of up to 1.67 ft-lbs, (9)  a robust intuitive control approach, (10) 24 hour endurance between refuel or recharge while conducting activities for daily living, (11) minimum of three grasp patterns (fine pinch, lateral pinch, power grip), (12) 2 degrees of freedom at the wrist, (13) humeral rotation, (14) effective cosmetic matching to the amputee, (15) noise below 50 dB(A) at 1 meter, (16) water and grit resistance, and (17) an automated system for fitting the prosthetic to the residual limb that accounts for shape and structure changes due to amputee activities and other normal physiological changes.  A level of modularity that will enable adaptation to varying degrees of stump length i

<DESC>ROBUST UNCERTAINTY MANAGEMENT, SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 2, DUE 052305, POC: DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4536. Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ 

The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new proposals for Robust Uncertainty Management (RUM).  The RUM Program will emphasize the development of mathematics and algorithms that guarantees performance by design for complex large-scale nonlinear federated systems.  The Department of Defense will often integrate a number of large, nonlinear subsystems to form a single system whose purpose is to perform a specific function.  The total system is composed of subsystems that are highly interconnected, simultaneously feature weak and strong nonlinear couplings, and are subject to resource constraints.  Typically the subsystems exploit different physical properties and mechanisms, and the subsystems will be governed by their own nonlinear dynamics across multiple temporal and spatial scales.  By its nature, the system is federated, distributed, and subject to uncertainty arising from incomplete knowledge of initial conditions, reducible errors arising from sensors, irreducible errors derived from modeling the physical system, as well as exogenous disturbances with an unknown distribution.  The primary issue is then to guarantee performance of the overall system and provide bounds on the performance of the system in the presence of epistemic and aleatory errors by design.  Guaranteeing performance is to be understood to mean that in the presence of partial or incomplete knowledge of the parameters or model describing the system that the values of specific state variables of the federated system can be predicted and maintained within a specified bound.  In particular the state variables of interest will be directly associated with the observable metrics of performance for the system.

The goal of the RUM program is to develop new mathematical tools that enable the design of large federated nonlinear systems with guaranteed performance in the presence of epistemic, aleatory, a priori, and a posteriori errors.  Intellectual effort should be directed toward a solution of the challenge problem that is described below.  The solution must be achieved by developing and employing a suite of new mathematical tools that enable analysis of the system, as well as incorporation of the analysis into a design for the system that guarantees performance.  These new methods shall be applied to either variation of the following cooperative surveillance challenge problem:  Consider N airborne sensors restricted to level flight at fixed altitude H.  Each sensor maneuvers in the altitude plane H and has a footprint on the ground of area A.  The N sensors need to perform surveillance of an area L squared with L >> NA.  It is further assumed that the sensors have a known constant probability of detection, pd and probability of false alarm, pfa against a single target class which is specified.  The sensors can determine if they are over terrain for which their probability of detecting a target is zero (i.e., an IR or visible sensor operating over foliage).  The challenge problems are for a fixed set of nonlinear dynamics between the surveillance sensors, what is the minimal connectivity between the sensors and the minimal time to guarantee surveillance of the area L squared at a specified Pd > pd and Pfa < pfa assuming a noisy communications channel while guaranteeing no collisions between the sensors.  The second variation of the challenge problem assumes a fixed noisy communication network and the objective is to define the interactions among the sensors and the dynamics of the sensors themselves to achieve the minimal time for surveillance while guaranteeing detection performance, i.e., a specified Pd > pd and Pfa < pfa, with no collisions between assets.

We would like to invite white papers and proposals that are far reacd, to outline a Phase 2 effort in their submissions.  If a Phase 2 is discussed, proposers should consider all necessary research and technical efforts to develop a successful prototype brain-based triage system for eventual deployment in an office-based analysis setting.

OTHER NOTES:
Although the initial phenomenon has been described with EEG, this solicitation is open to the use of any number of sensors or sensor combinations to achieve the program vision.  If multiple sensor types are proposed, one MUST be neurophysiologically-based in order to be evaluated for award.  Designs for novel sensors will be considered as part of this effort, provided offerers address the three stated technical goals.

Efforts that combine computer processing and neuroscience-based capabilities will be considered.  However, this program is not focused on the design of computer vision or biomimetic target detection systems and proposers offering solutions involving solely that approach will not be considered for award.

Through the program, awardees will have the opportunity to use UNCLAS image sets in their testing provided by potential transition partners.

SUBMISSIONS:
White papers (10 pages or less) will be accepted in response to this announcement. The white paper should be organized as follows:
       
1.	An Executive Summary.  A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea. We are looking for ideas that will generate revolutionary capabilities if the proposed work is successfully completed over a 3 year period of performance;
2.	A concise statement of the scientific and technical challenges, unique approaches, and anticipated potential technical solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This statement should demonstrate that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art; 
3.	Explicit timelines and milestone achievements by which progress toward the goals can be evaluated.  These milestones must reflect a period of performance of 12 months for Phase 1.  Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics of performance; 
4.	A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding; 
5.	A brief summary of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members and a management plan for multi-organizational teams.
      6. Brief list of relevant references.

    White papers sent in response to this addendum are due at DARPA no later than 1600 hours ET, March 7, 2005. Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 15 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested. To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/. Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.

FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSALS.  Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa05-19.  To receive consideration under this addendum, PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 ET APRIL 15, 2004, at the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA only.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a full proposal created with the requirements listed in this addendum and in accordance with the original BAA05-19 published.  Note: if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system at the address listed below or the BAA e-mail account.

Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the areas of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal, 3) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.

Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program. Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged. Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 12 months; however, proposers are invited to submit proposals for a full Phase1/Phase 2 research program. If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements. Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. 

PROPOSAL EVALUATION:
Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA05-19. For complete details on writing a full proposal, please see original FEDBIZOPPS solicitation, BAA05-19, http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

<DESC>MODIFICATION No. 4.  The purpose of this modification is to answer additional questions regarding the subject RFP, as follows:

MIDAS RFP #514-05-011: Questions & Answers. Modification #4

Q23:   Section L9(c) refers to the “Managing/monitoring/accounting of the loan capitol fund”, however Section C does not mention that fund?  Does this refer to grants issued under the contract as outlined under Section C, or is the loan fund different?

A:    Please refer to the answer for previous Question 19: This a separate fund that is not envisioned under the MIDAS effort.
“Q19:   Paragraph L.9.c, Page No. 67 states that overhead expenses for loan capital funds are not allowable. Please clarify this statement; specifically, does it apply to initial startup expenses of microfinancing organizations? Additionally, are MHO expenses allowable?
A:      The language regarding loan capital funds should be deleted in its’ entirety;” 
Q24:  Section J, Attachment 4 for the RFP provides a Resume Format, but there is no guidance in the RFP about using this resume format.  Also, the format asks for information such as “Annual Salary and Proposed Labor Category”, neither of which are appropriate for a technical submission for a CPFF completion type contract.  Please clarify if and how this Resume Format should be used?
A.  The Resume Format found in the RFP is a “Suggested Resume Format, which is usually adequate for most purposes”.  Of course, we feel it is unnecessary to dictate to our audience any level of strict conformance with a specified format for such a requirement in view of the fact that there are a myriad of such formats available. 
Q25:  Please clarify the precise estimated completion dates for each of the programs that will eventually be assumed into the MIDAS contract.  Also if possible, it would be helpful to receive LOP, or most recent annual work plans for those programs?
A.  Of course, we realize, appreciate, and understand that offering any “precise estimated completion dates” for any of the proposed activities is currently beyond our abilities of our very competent technical staff.  The Mission will make a decision on the future of current programs at the earliest possible juncture after the MIDAS contract award, in collaboration with the successful offeror.  Just a note:  In many cases our on-going programs have no potential for synergy with, and therefore no possibility for merging into any of the proposed MIDAS activities.   We encourage offerors to simply focus on submitting innovative responses to the RFP. Otherwise, please see Q11 and the related answer at Modification No. 3 to the RFP:
Q11: Will offerors have access to documents that were generated by the implementers who are currently under contract to USAID?
A:   The RFP and Annexes were designed to minimize the extent to which any offeror would need additional background documentation.  We suggest that any offeror who may need additional information pursue it via a “Freedom of Information Act” Request.  

Q26:  Section C3 of the RFDP states, “Neither program ($10 Million Specialty Coffee Program, and the $10 Million Dairy Industry Program) will be included in the overall effort”.  Please provide additional clarifications to this statement?
A.  We feel that the statement is quite clear.  Neither of the stated programs will be a part of the proposed MIDAS effort.
Q27:  Section H.17 “Grants under Contracts”, and Section L.9(d) “Summary of Budget Elements” suggest that the contractor will be responsible for a sizeable grants program.  Can USAID offer guidance as to the amount of grant funding anticipated, or the magnitude of the grants funding relative to technical assistance?  Or, does the contractor have complete latitude to propose amounts and mix of TA/grants consistent with proposed approaches?
A.  Please refer to our answer to the previous Q4 noted in the answers at Modification No. 3.
Q4:    With regard to the allocation of funds on this procurement, what percentage of the $160 million will be allocated for grants and what percentage will be identified for technical assistance? 
A:     The Mission has not made a determination with regard to any amount(s) that may be allocated to Grants.  Each of the four major components under the RFP requires a different mix of technical and other assistance, and the Mission encourages all bidders to submit creative and realistic proposals.
Q28:  Given the exceptionally long (90) day proposal development period, we suggest that USAID consider a second round of questions and answers, at perhaps the midpoint of the process.  We believe that after conducting field research for the MIDAS proposal, contractors will have several additional informed questions and issues for USAID. Responses and/or guidance from USAID to these will result in more responsive, stronger proposals for MIDAS implementation?
A.  A special thank you for this question.  Please be advised that we surely do appreciate the degree of effort that will be involved in the preparation of responses to the MIDAS RFP.  Further, we are confident, and fully believe that our current approach will result in very strong and competitive responses to the RFP.
Q29:  Section L.10(4)(v)(A) states, “..Successful use of small business concerns will be considered as part of the evaluation of past performance in Section M”, however, Section M.5.1.4, Past Performance, does not assign a factor to the use of small businesses.  Please clarify if a specific evaluation factor will be applied to the use of small businesses, and if this information can be presented in an Annex?
A.  The evaluation of Past Performance will include an assessment of the degree to which such businesses have been utilized in the past by the offeror.  The specific evaluation factor to be addressed in Section M at Past Performance is at M.4.1.4.1, Quality of Performance, where the extent to which small businesses added to the achievement of this factor.  
Q30:  Section L.10 cannot be removed in entirety because there is relevant information to proposal development contained therein.  What sections are to be removed?
A.  The part of Section L.10 that should be disregarded is at Subsection (a), the fourth paragraph that Begins, “Describe how the team will coordinate and integrate the municipal government strengthening and alternative development investments.  In addition, …………..growth at the national level. 
Q31:  Section M.4.1.4.5 is identified as “Effectiveness of Key Personnel, however the version released to the Public notes that Section M.5.1.4.5 addresses “Effectiveness of Key Personnel”?
A.  Section M.5.1.4.5, Effectiveness of Key Personnel is the correct one.

TITLE:  JBI Client Development for C2 Systems and Intel Systems

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 04-05-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted within 30 days of this publication; FY 05 by 1 Nov 04; and FY 06 by 1 Nov 05.

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate, Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Program Office of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for the development and/or adaptation of C2 and Intel systems to be capable of exploiting the power of a JBI information management system (reference the following US Air Force [USAF] Scientific Advisory Board's "Report on Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere Volume 1: Summary" for JBI concepts and definitions: http://www.rl.af.mil/programs/jbi/documents/JBIVolume1.pdf).
The objective of this BAA will be to explore innovative technical solutions and to design, develop and demonstrate prototype software components for integrating existing C2 applications into a JBI information space that supports future Net Centric Operations (NCO) infrastructures such as the Air Force's ConstellationNet concept.  Critical to achieving this objective it to ascertain how a JBI information space and a collection of well-designed clients that utilize the information space can improve warfighter awareness, capabilities and interoperability without adversely impacting evolving C2 systems, data flow among these C2 systems, networks, common operating environments, and existing concepts of operation.

A JBI is an interoperable information space which aggregates, integrates, fuses, and intelligently disseminates relevant battlespace information to support decision-making at all echelons of a Joint Task Force (JTF), delivering "Decision Quality" information to the warfighter. It is intended to serve as an integrating substrate upon which legacy and emerging systems can be linked together to support transparent information exchange across the full spectrum of mission activities and functional domains.

One of the primary goals of the JBI is to take initial steps in developing an information interoperability infrastructure that connects disparate software applications or "clients," and facilitates information exchange between these clients creating a cohesive combat information management system.   Another goal of the JBI is to integrate existing C2 and Intel systems within an information space without replacing these systems.  To that end, this BAA will provide the design considerations, software components and technical know-how to integrate pertinent existing clients within an information space developed by AFRL known as the JBI Reference Implementation (RI). 

For all contracts under this BAA, AFRL/IF will provide the following after contract award: (1) the evolving JBI RI and documentation; (2) Java and web services programming language mapping to the JBI Common Client Application Program Interface (CAPI) that provides access to the RI; (see http://www.infospherics.org/ for details on the CAPI) (3) the evolving information object model that defines the base XML schema definition for some JBI information objects exchanged or manipulated during this effort; (4) a subset of relevant data link messages that should be represented as JBI information objects with embedded hierarchy, metadata schema, and payload information as information engineering deliverables; and (5) integration and integration support activities to connect the individual software components and approaches developed by all parties under this effort within the context of common scenarios and demonstration threads.

Contractors shall work with AFRL as concept and prototype component software designers and developers and shall provide integration support of their client adaptation concepts/components among specified C2 and Intel systems and between the JBI RI to achieve stated objectives.     Final demonstrations will be conducted at one or more Government facilities.  Several scenarios and targeted operational domains shall be considered during the period of performance and will be guided by input from potential end user representatives from across the operational Air Force community.  Strongest consideration will be given to those proposals in which coordination with an end user is clearly established especially concerning solutions with respect to tactical domain problems.  The goal should be to deliver a demonstration of the technology to the end user.

Potential offerors will need to perform a subset of the following tasks:

(1)  Identify and document concepts, techniques and technologies for integrating existing USAF or Joint/Coalition systems/applications into a JBI information space with positive impact to the operation of these systems and minimal impact to the operator/warfighter.  C2 and Intel systems and applications across the functional spectrum from the actual platform carrying out a mission/task to the Combatant Commander dictating strategies and tactics will be considered.

(2)  Identify and document transition opportunities and strategies for JBI core services and adapted clients to meet warriors' needs.  Describe approaches that balance the co-evolution of C2/Intel concepts and technologies in a manner that addresses critical accreditation, common operating environment, security, survivability, operation over unreliable communication links, system administration, long-term maintenance and other issues that plague designers of to-be-fielded systems.  Key to any successful transition of JBI technologies will be the realization that there will be no "cut-over date" when operational systems will be using the JBI substrate as the primary means of interoperability.  Rather, the transition will occur gradually and will only happen, if at each phase, the JBI core and clients maintain a low profile/footprint with minimal overhead, yet provides added value to the warfighter.  Added value is defined as either providing operators access to information or capabilities they never had before or providing better machine-to-machine interface flexibility and/or affordability than an existing interface governed by a rigid and costly ICD; or both.

(3)  Design, develop, test, integrate and demonstrate adapted legacy client components that form an information bridge between true legacy applications/systems and the JBI RI.  Depending upon the scenario; targeted warfighter domain; participating legacy C2/Intel systems, applications, nodes and platforms; demonstration location; and capabilities of the JBI RI, the following types of legacy client components may be adapted and assembled:

a.  Embedded Components.  Resides on a military platform such as an aircraft or vehicle, maintains a low software footprint and is strategically "wrapped" as another on-board feature that meets platform processing, look and feel (graphical or other presentation), weight restrictions and other stringent guidelines subject to accreditation.  The embedded component shall communicate with other C2 nodes and data link gateways via standard tactical communication links.

b.  C2 Node Components.  Resides on more capable military platforms that act as C2 nodes (AWACS, JSTARS, or their ground stations etc) or fixed, large C2 installations that have adequate bandwidth and access to a JBI configuration.  These components speak JBI and act as proxies for the more disadvantaged embedded components.  C2 node components can aggregate or selectively control data flow to embedded components based on information exchanged within a JBI.  They can also interact with either the data or information link side of the gateway components depending upon their task.

c.  Data Link-Information Link Gateway Components.  These components act as translators, filters or aggregators between publishers/subscribers in a data link network and publishers/subscribers in an information link network.  Consider a subscriber on an Information Link (JBI information space) who needs access to information whose ultimate source produced by a node on a Link-16 network.  In this example, a subscription on a JBI Information Link should theoretically be translated to a subscription on a data link and once received via data link subscription, properly translated and published to the information link for the JBI subscriber and other JBI consumers.

d.  JBI-Legacy Client Components.     If processing power is available, add-on development is feasible, and the client application software can still be compliant in a common operating environment (e.g., Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment [DII/COE] or others) despite JBI client requirements, then JBI-Legacy client components would be preferred.     These client components should integrate seamlessly into the host application and its underlying infrastructure.

e.  Native JBI Client Components.  Brand new components to showcase JBI infrastructure capabilities that either are not concerned with specific run-time environment restrictions, or other compliance issues, and are generally assumed to demonstrate a new capability not in a legacy system's arsenal.

(4)  For any specialized embedded software, hardware, networking or communications links that are proposed, it is up to the potential offerors to outline additional requirements to make demonstrations successful.  For example, if a JTIDS terminal is required in which a small software process would be embedded to act as a datalink-infolink gateway client, document it, state the costs, and be cognizant of the fact that some demonstration locations will not have direct line of sight (LOS) to the JTIDS in the sky.  If it is better to acquire or have access to datalink simulators, clearly describe your (and AFRL's) acquisition approach and any upfront costs.  If you propose an embedded component that would provide an F15-E pilot a window into the JBI onboard the aircraft, describe your approach for "wrapping" the component and what other Government agencies AFRL/IF would need to coordinate with to ensure success.  If you believe you have a complete end-to-end solution involving the aforementioned components in a variety of platforms and command hierarchies, you should clearly state any proprietary components and any limitations (cost or otherwise) associated with production or fielding of your proposed solution.  In all cases, potential offerors should identify how they would interact with other Contractors awarded tasks under this effort in the absence of formal Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA).

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit – Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience – The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution – The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value – Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity to achieve the objectives of this BAA. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

<SUBJECT>69 -- LCAC SLEP MAINTENANCE TRAINING COURSEWARE
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-LCACSS050503
<RESPDATE>051805
<ARCHDATE>06022005
<CONTACT>Greg Dougherty, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-8419, Fax 407-380-8399, Email gregory.dougherty@navy.mil
<DESC>The Department of the Navy is seeking potential sources with the ability to produce Service Life Extention Program (SLEP) Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Maintenance Training Courseware (curriculum, hardware, software, and training devices) that will be used for instructing students in the functionality, operation and maintenance of the SLEP LCAC systems in normal and casualty modes of operation.  Providing instructors is not a requirement.  This courseware will be a synthesis of existing LCAC legacy training and differences resulting from the implementation of an LCAC SLEP program.  It is estimated that 50% of the courses are changed as a result of the SLEP.

The SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware must provide a  predetermined (Government specified) blended solution approach (instructor led and alternative technology based instruction) to preventive and corrective action maintenance training to include instructions in troubleshooting and fault isolation procedures and techniques, parts removal and replacement, repairs (to the lowest repairable unit), and verification of corrective actions.  Predetermined numbers and types of training devices must be produced to reinforce student learning and enable students to perform preventive and corrective maintenance tasks directly correlated with maintenance course objectives. Through the use of the appropriate LCAC Operational and Maintenance Technical Manuals and Drawings, and simulated (virtual) and actual tools and test equipment, the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware shall provide training at the system, subsystem and component levels.  Simulated interactions with SLEP LCAC on line and off line diagnostics programs and accurate simulation of operational symptoms as a result of instructor induced simulated faults are essential requirements of the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware.  

Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following: 1) A submission of your firm’s detailed capabilities to meet the requirements listed above, 2) Your firm’s degree of familiarity with: a) the SLEP LCAC Program, b) the SLEP LCAC Technical Manuals and Drawings, c) the SLEP LCAC Operational and Diagnostic Software, and d) the VELCAC Trainer Software; 3) A discussion of any customary business practices that might affect the firm's fulfillment of the requirement or its relationship with the Navy customer; and 4) A statement as to whether the firm responding to this announcement is a small business for the NAICS code that pertains to the product being offered. A set aside decision will be made based on submission of this data.

This announcement is published for informational purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement.

It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document, limited to three pages, via Email, and in time to be received by 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time on 18 May 2005.

Emails should be addressed to:

There are no other prescribed format requirements for the response to this announcement.

All firms responding to this announcement will be notified if a requirement is solicited. Small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women owned small business concerns are encouraged to submit responses to this announcement. 

The Department of the Navy will use the responses to the announcement to make an informed decision concerning the strategy it will pursue to meet its objectives and, if the Department of the Navy elects to proceed with a procurement, to structure the solicitation to maximize commercial sector interest and encourage truly innovative and imaginative proposals.

Questions/Answers

1.	What is the difference between hardware and training devices?

Training devices can be anything from a deck of cards for recognition, to a Full Mission Trainer.  The significant difference is that training devices (as we in the Navy identify them) are inducted into the Cog 2”O” inventory.  Hardware is something you can hand me, that I can measure with a ruler, or a weight scale.

2.	What company is doing the Media Analysis?

The Media Analysis will be Government owned information and will be made available for this requirement.


3.	What is VELCAC?

Virtual Environment LCAC (Landing Craft Air Cushion).

4.	Will we accept teaming arrangements as capabilities?

Capabilities submitted for this requirement should state the capabilities of the Prime contractor for the work.

5.	The current courseware. When was it developed? By whom? What tool was it developed in?

Textron Marine developed the original courseware in the 1980’s.  In the early 1990’s, TSM Corporation made major revisions to the courseware. Courseware was developed under MIL-STD 1379B using WordPerfect software.

<DESC>The Cooperative Studies Program (CSP), a division of New Mexico VA Health Care System Office of Research and Developmentis seeking sources that are able to perform the following services:  Please e-mail inquiries to Cesar Fausto at Cesar.Fausto@csp.research.med.va.gov no later then 2:00 p.m. mst on Wednesday May 18, 2005.   CSP intends to contract with a GCP Quality Assurance Specialist to provide quality assurance services.  This contractor will expand the current GCP Quality Assurance Program, refining all policies, procedures and tools as necessary.  The contractor will have primary responsibility for the maintenance and direction of the program which shall then consist of 1) conducting GCP compliance audits at selected sites participating in the CSP trails, 2) a site monitor training program for CSP trial monitors, 3) a GCP training course for Investigators and other personnel conducting CSP trials, 4) developing study-specific procedures and tools for each new CSP study protocol to promote GCP and 5) a GCP Implementation Program for newly funded CSP trials.  The GCP Implementation Program utilizes site visits by monitors or others from SMART for the purpose of training site personnel in the study-specific GCP procedures to be used in the trial.  The QA Specialist will also be required to provide advice and assistance to SMART to aid in policy and program development as needed to continue or expand the GCP services of SMART.  The services of an individual are being solicited rather than those of a management team or provider of professional personnel.  Necessary services must be provided personally by that individual or, if volume of service exceeds the capacity of this contractor, by a subcontractor or subcontractors meeting all the qualifying criteria of the upcoming solicitation and specifically approved by The Director of SMART. It is estimated that the contractor will perform 10% to 40% of services in travel status to VA CSP study or meeting sites with the remainder of the time divided between the contractor’s place of the business and the SMART office in Albuquerque, NM as the need for frequent prolonged visits to the SMART office is anticipated.  The contractor may be requested to perform up to 16 audits annually (precise locations unknown at this time), each trip requiring about 3 days in travel status and an additional 3 days for prep and follow-up.  Additional travel will be required to present the GCP course at an anticipated rate of 12 courses per year. To be eligible for contract award, the candidate must have at least 5 years of experience in providing GCP Quality Assurance services to clinical research organizations.  Candidate’s work history must include evidence of substantive experience in preparing and delivery GCP training programs to research professionals, reviewing paper and electronic medical records, and directing the actions of teams of monitors, auditors, or other clinical QA personnel.  Additionally, at least one year of the candidate’s GCP QA experience must have involved personally providing services at a full-time or near full-time rate to federally funded research program.  This experience must also have involved monitoring or auditing at VA research sites and extensive use and familiarity with the VA electronic medical records system.  The candidate must also have professional certification as a Clinical Research Associate by the Association of Clinical Research Professionals or an equivalent certifying organization, and must be certified or eligible for certification in Human Subjects Protections by PRIMR/ARENA.

17.  The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division plans to negotiate with Rolls-Royce Corporation on a sole source basis under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".   The contractor will be responsible for presenting a 5-day EMS 6.1 Maintenance training course in Taiwan from 27 July – 02 August 2005.  Key issues associated with this need involve the utilization of a qualified EMS 6.1 instructor who can teach the operation and application of the EMS and maintenance procedure for the EMS PC Ground Station through a combined classroom and on-the-job training approach. The training is required to support the delivery and maintenance training for two E2T aircrafts. Rolls Royce Corporation is the provider of the T56-A-427 engines on the Taiwan Air Force (TAF) HE2KE aircraft. The estimated period of performance is 27 July through 02 August 2005.  A rough order of magnitude of the cost for this effort is $100,000.  The E-2T HE2KE EMS technical design data is not available and development of a data package suitable for a competition would delay the delivery of the training to the TAF by a minimum of six months to a year after delivery of the aircraft.  This delay would create a severe impact on the TAF operational effectiveness and undermine the successful integration of the Hawkeye 2000E aircraft into the TAF force structure.  Currently, only Rolls-Royce Corporation possesses the necessary working knowledge of the proprietary data for the EMS used in the TAF HE2KE aircraft to ensure that the TAF students are capable of properly maintaining the engines. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address (Attn: Romy Roman-Conway) by 2 PM Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday, 25 May 2005.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.*****

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations paragraph 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Purpo se.  To solicit Ideas for a Potential Directed Energy (DE) Weapon System Prototypes. Background.  Last year, OSD developed a Directed Energy Roadmap that required the Services to identify 1) potential new applications for directed energy (DE) technologies and operational concepts for their use; 2) options to ensure ongoing DE development efforts are integrated to the maximum extent possible, as well as their potential to become joint programs/capabilities; 3) program feasibility and timing, and the adequacy  of the FY 2006 POMs for implementing these programs; 4) options to accelerate the transition of DE capabilities, including airborne relay mirror systems, to the joint warfighter; and 5) information and intelligence improvements necessary to support DE wea pon uses.  OSD only considered DE weapons, not DE devices such as target designators and communications systems.  In response, the Army identified capability areas where DE might be a solution, DE technology and system development programs that may provide  potential solutions to these capability areas, and additional supporting developmental efforts that would be needed to enable continued DE research and development.  The Army feels that directed energy technology, including moderate to high energy lasers and high powered radio frequency (e.g., microwaves) might be used to fulfill some of its capability gaps listed below. Scope. To support the planning process for revising and improving the Armys Directed Energy Roadmap and Implementation Plan, the Air and  Missile Defense Battle Lab (AMDBL) is seeking voluntary information from government and industry addressing potential prototype directed energy systems (including solid state laser systems, high power radio frequency systems, and other unique directed ene rgy systems) that could fulfill Army capability gaps. Capabilities Gaps and Desired Characteristics. Several capability gaps have been identified by TRADOC proponents that have potential directed energy solutions.  The desired characteristics for future Ar my directed energy systems support commanders in the joint and interagency operational environment with reduced burden compared to todays systems.  Specific gaps and characteristics include: Gap 1  Defeat In-Flight Projectiles:  Defeating in-flight proje ctiles to include:  rockets, artillery, and mortars; anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and rocket propelled grenades (RPG); and man-portable surface-to-air missiles. Gap 2  Non-lethal Capability:  Deterring / disrupting personnel and vehicles/equipment; Ga p 3  Ultra-Precision Strike:  Destroying targets with little to no collateral damage; Gap 4  Anti-Sensor:  Disruption of electrical-optical (EO) and infra-red (IR) sensors; and Gap 5  Ordnance / IED Neutralization:  Neutralizing mines and other ordnance (especially improvised explosive devices (IED)) from a stand-off. Characteristic 1  Joint multi-role / multi-mission systems; Characteristic 2  Scalable effects (non-lethal t o lethal); Characteristic 3  Deep magazines; Characteristic 4  Reduced logistical burdens; and Characteristic 5  Mobility (size / weight / power).   Information Sought.  The following information on proposed potential prototypes is sought;  a. The poten tial prototype(s) should show technological feasibility within a 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 month timeframe, with emphasis on the 12-24 month timeframes.  Information provided for the prototype is restricted to the SECRET level.  Recommendations on a technolog y development plan are desired to support development of proposals of Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs). b. An assessment of the maturity of the technology involved is desir ed to support identification of the risk and programmatic efforts necessary to mature the technology and achieve a conceptual capability within the 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 month timeframes.  Participants should give current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments and rationale.  Also, a plan for growing the TRL should be provided.  TRL descriptions may be found in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook located on-line at http://akss.dau.mil/dag/. c.    Anticipated Program Overview.  An estimate of the schedu le and funding profile to develop the potential prototype is desired to enable an evaluation of the affordability of the proposed solution.  An estimate of the procurement cost per unit will enable an assessment of the affordability to achieve a conceptual  capability within the 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 month timeframe and an assessment of the affordability of the procurement tail. Responses.  All responses will be reviewed by an AMDBL team consisting of government personnel and their support contractors.  All  information provided will be adequately protected.  Any proprietary information must be identified Releasable to Government Agencies and their supporting Contractors for Review Only. Responses to this request for information are requested by 20 May 2005 .  Please send responses to:  Air and Missile Defense Battlelab, ATTN: Mr. Rod Chavez, 5800 Carter Road, Ft. Bliss, Texas 79916.   Questions should be emailed to chavezr3@bliss.army.mil.

(See: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa05-19pt2.html). Synopsis: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) released Solicitation Number BAA05-19, Addendum 6, in February 2005 for Integrated Plasma Generating Structures.  The Advanced Sensing and Optical Measurement Branch (ASOMB) of the NASA Langley Research Center plans to respond to this solicitation and the primary focus is on the development of a variety of systems that are used to dramatically improve aerodynamic performance of vehicles in flight.  There is a potential opportunity that will require the design and development of plasma devices for aerodynamic flow control in an effort to improve aerodynamic performance.  The goal of this potential program is to begin development of concepts that could be used to generate plasmas and study the effects of these devices on overall aerodynamic performance.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in ASOMB to begin development of plasma devices that could potentially be tested on future flight vehicles. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers’ ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers’ facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Potential partnering opportunities exist in the following technology development areas associated with the development of integrated plasma generating devices. (1)	Development of Plasma Devices for Breakdown of Air in High-Speed Aerodynamic Flow. (2)	Design, Development and Consulting on High Power, Pulsed, High Repetition Rate Microwave Power Supplies. (3)	Design and Construction of a Large Evacuable Chamber for Microwave Breakdown Studies. (4)	Microwave and Optical/Spectroscopic Laboratory Support at Langley Research Center Labs and/or Test Facilities. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria identified above.  All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Dr. Reginald J. Exton, Mail Stop 493, Building 1200, Room 223, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: r.j.exton@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is May 20, 2005. Procurement questions should be directed to C. Tom Weih, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-3878, Carl.T.Weih@nasa.gov

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A CERAMIC CANDLING INSPECTION SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to further develop and commercialize LLNL's Ceramic Candling Inspection System.

The Candling System was developed as a visual inspection system for the Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) group at LLNL to assist in the post-machining inspection phase of manufactured ceramic parts.  A prototype system was designed, built and incorporated into the operations of our NDE facility.  The prototype system has proven to be a very useful NDE inspection tool for ceramics. It enables a faster more accurate physical characterization of ceramics than previously accomplished.

We believe that the candling process developed for ceramic inspections can also be a high value, quick turn-around, low cost NDE inspection tool for many other translucent or semi-translucent materials.

LLNL is seeking industrial partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Ceramic Candling Inspection System should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing
this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 106-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Ceramic Candling Inspection System.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT No. (BAA) 05-02-AEDC/PKP:  The Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T+E/S+T) development.  DTRMC seeks innovative proposals in the hypersonics area that will allow improved test and evaluation of current systems and future systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to perform basic research, but to develop subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment. The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  DTRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas of (not in priority):  1) COMBUSTION AND NON-INTRUSIVE FLOW DIAGNOSTICS for ground test applications (applications to flight test is a plus), specifically, non-intrusive measurement capability for determination of species concentration, temperature, and/or velocities in flows associated with hypersonic test facilities and scramjet engines are required.  Robust systems capable of working reliably in a test environment, that are minimally intrusive to the test article and facil!  ity hardware, and have the capability of retrieving spatially resolved flow parameters are especially needed.  2) CONCEPTS FOR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT TERMINATION SYSTEMS FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TEST VEHICLES are required.  3) Technologies that aid in the STRUCTURAL TESTING or provide new capabilities in testing of materials and whole vehicle static structural testing at elevated temperatures and pressure conditions that simulate hypersonic flight conditions are required.  4) NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE VARIABLE MACH NUMBER HYPERSONIC GROUND TESTING facilities that will provide hypersonic flight trajectory simulation capabilities are required.  Specifically, enabling technologies for large scale ground testing of integrated turbine based combined cycle/ramjet/scramjet inlet and mode transition testing are required.   It is expected that a modified AEDC Aeropropulsion Engine Test Facility (ASTF) (with extension of Mach number to 4 or 5) will be the only viable candidate for such a large scale integrated propulsion test capability and therefore will be the only viable candidate for receiving the proposed technology.  5) CLEAN AIR HEATER TECHNOLOGIES for hypersonic test facilities capable of providing reliable non-vitiated air for hypersonic testing applications is required; 6) MODELING AND SIMULATION (M+S) efforts that have application to test and evaluation are required. Areas of interest include: integrated propulsion system and airframe performance models, high speed (+M5) store separation, aerothermal heat transfer with application to aerodynamic shaping and thermal management including aerothermal chemistry and boundary-layer transition effects, transient modeling incorporating the effects of inlet un-start and combustor dynamics, electron beam energy addition to high pressure flows, !  ultra high pressure aerothermal equation of state of air (approx. 300,000 psi).  M+S efforts with demonstrated verification of predictive/modeling capabilities using existing or acquisition of new data are preferred, and must possess strong test and evaluation applications.  M+S proposals must possess a strongly stated T+E application justification. M+S proposals with primarily system development application will receive little or no preference.  PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5-$3.0M are expected to be made in FY06.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  The prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  GENERAL INFORMATION:   Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies. DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is not a requirement.   Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T+E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T+E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well. Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY07 or later and will be contingent on fund availability, merit of performance in previous phases, and anticipated future T+E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 20 May 05.  Each proposal should specify the benefiting U.S.  military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T+E hypersonic need.   Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  EVALUATION: Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) relevance to current T+E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs(3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort, and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T+E application and/or to DoD  T+E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonics Test Working Group,  T+through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .pdf format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Kathy P. Swanson, 100 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB, TN 37389-1332.

REQUIREMENT:  The Bureau of Land Management, Bishop Field Office, Bishop, CA has a requirement for collection of native seed from the vicinity of the West Walker and Eastern Sierra Watersheds. Native Seed Specifications for Seeding Treatments on the Dana Fire and Material for Seed Banking Purposes A.	General Description: Availability of native seed, especially local ecotypes for emergency fire and erosion control projects is often difficult to obtain.  This project would enhance our capability to begin to obtain yearly collections of native seed from critical wildlife habitat areas, e.g. key mule deer and sage grouse habitat as well as unique plant assemblages.  By banking these collections we would be able to not only respond to emergency "seeding" situations in a timely manner, but also be assured that the integrity of native plant gene pools is maintained. Seed material would be stored in an existing, cooperatively managed seed bank that is maintained by our local Eastern Sierra Weed Management. B.  Seed Mixture Selection and Certification:  The seed mixture for this landscape collection contract was selected by the Bishop Field Office Botanist and is based on agency policies, regulations and mandates.  Seeds should be tested for purity and germination rates.  There should be no more than 1 percent native species in the collection of seeds.   Before accepting delivery of seed shipment the contractor must provide written evidence (seed label and letter) to the Field Office Botanist that the seed conforms to the purity and germination requirements in the specification.  Test methods specified in the Rules for Testing Seeds, Proceedings of the Association of Official Seed Analyst  would be acceptable for determining the germination rate.  Seed designated without a purity or germination rate shall be labeled to include the name, date (month and year) collected, and the name and address of the seed supplier.  Certified Pure Live Seed (PLS) from the following native species would be used for the project. If some of the species are not available, substitutions within the same price range would be allowed.  Seeds for the Dana Fire would be from the West Walker/Eastern Sierra watersheds and would be seeded in the fall of 2005 depending on seed availability. Seeds for the seed banking portion of the project would be from the eastern Sierra region.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.   If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.   If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.   Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.   This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).   Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285
Fax:     202-267-4011.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK Hybridization of zebrafish RNA samples on Agilent zebrafish microarrays BACKGROUND										 As part of an Office of Research Development (ORD) wide computational toxicology project, the combination of whole organism endpoints, genomic, proteomic, and metabonomic approaches, and computational modeling will be used in small fish models to identify new molecular biomarkers of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and link those biomarkers to effects that are relevant for both diagnostic and predictive risk assessments.   Using zebrafish (Danio rerio), flow-through exposures of differing durations will be conducted for 9 chemicals using sexually-mature animals (ab, wild-type strain) from existing on-site cultures.  Four replicate tanks containing both males and females will be used for each treatment at Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED, Duluth, MN).  Gonad, brain, and liver samples will be collected from fish at appropriate intervals and preserved in RNA later.  Samples will be shipped on wet ice to Ecological Exposure Research Division (EERD, Cincinnati, OH) for RNA isolation.   Zebrafish oligonucleotide microarrays and hybridization services will be used to identify genes and pathways that respond to the various chemicals and disrupt the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis in adult tissues.  This ?mining? approach for identifying key indicators out of over 22,000 potential genes will help to isolate and identify the likely indicators for extrapolation to the fathead minnow as an  environmental model.  For chemicals where the mode of action (MOA) has been characterized ( -trenbolone, flutamide, vinclozolin, fadrozole, and prochloraz), samples for microarray analyses will be limited initially to early time points of 24 and 48 hours in order to assess the early transcriptomic responses.  Although multiple tissues will be dissected from each chemical exposure, single tissues will be assessed via microarray analyses according to ongoing fathead minnow studies and known pathway interactions for each chemical, with the exception of prochloraz which is known to have mixed MOA affecting liver and gonad.  Four replicates of pooled RNA from 2 individuals (8 fish) will be used per treatment to increase the statistical power of analyses while helping to reduce variability between individuals.  No less than 2  randomly chosen pooled samples will be hybridized on duplicate arrays to assess experimental variability.  For a single tissue, 3 doses (control, 2 chemical doses), and 2 time points, a total of 24 arrays will be required with an additional 2 arrays for dye flip/duplicate controls.  Prochloraz exposures will be assessed in 2 tissues for a total of 48 arrays with additional arrays for controls.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS: Custom Zebrafish Array Services  The contractor shall provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) array services using a custom printed 60-mer 22K Zebrafish oligo array.  The contractor shall provide consultation on research goals and experimental design, RNA QC and labeling, array hybridization, image scanning and QC, data extraction, and data analysis.  The contractor shall  utilize Agilent equipment to determine the quality and concentration of incoming total RNA samples.  Reagents for arrays shall be obtained from the same array vendor to ensure QA/QC throughout the contract.  Deposition of these data into the National Center for Toxicogenomics (NCT) Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS) Knowledge Base, whose goal is to support research that promotes mechanistic understanding of environmentally induced toxicity and disease, is an important requirement of this project.   Quality assurance and control (QA/QC) are critical in obtaining highly reproducible microarray results.  Ensuring quality shall be performef by a highly trained and expert staff.  The contractor shall provide EPA with documentation of tested and validated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  SOPs shall employ rigorous QC measures at each individual step of the process, starting with the experimental design of the study, and proceeding through labeling of the RNAs, microarray hybridization and scanning, and acquisition of the data.  The contractor shall perform the following 2 categories of quality control as follows: Category 1 RNA and Labeling Quality Control  - Including the 260/280 ratio, 260/230 ratio, 28S/18S ratio; and cRNA yield.  RNA samples shall be delivered in pure nuclease free water, frozen in dry ice, by overnight shipping.  Upon receipt of RNA, the Contractor shall run samples through an Agilent Bioanalyzer for analysis of RNA quality.  Good quality RNAs with 28S/18S ratios >1.49 and a low baseline between the 18S and Nano Marker (first fluorescent peak before 24 seconds) are considered acceptable. - RNA samples with visible signs of impurities (260/280 or 260/280 less than 2.0) or low concentration are reported to EPA and shall not be further processed without consultation with EPA.  Category 2 Process and Procedural Control  - For arrays, 1 to 2 ?g of total RNA shall be used for each labeling reaction.  EPA will specify which samples should be combined for pooling.  Labeling of cRNA, hybridization, washes, and scanning shall be performed according to array vendor optimization, which include spike in controls to assess cRNA production efficiency.  After completion of the array hybridizations, scanning and data extraction, Contractor shall QC the images according to the following guidelines: - Image quantitation parameters shall be identical throughout the experiment. - The raw image shall be free from obvious artifacts (bright areas, dark areas, scratches, dust, intensity gradients, smudges, bright edges, streaking, uneven background) and the entire microarray surface shall be visible and in focus. - The raw feature intensities shall range from just above zero to near saturation. That is, the full linear range of the scanner shall be exploited. In general, the median shall be as high as possible while simultaneously avoiding significant numbers of saturated spots.  - Quality scores for feature quantitation shall be provided to EPA if produced by software. - The median (chip wide, probe level) raw expression level and the median absolute deviation in raw expression level shall not differ more than 3 fold between any two hybridizations in an experiment. Deliverable Contractor shall provide to EPA, in the form of CD or DVD, as soon as raw data is available for each batch set of samples sent by EPA: - RNA QC data and images - scanner settings and image quantitation parameters used throughout experiments - .TIFF files of array images  - spot file information with detailed annotation - .xls files of the raw image data   Data from any specified replicate hybridizations shall be merged and reported as a single data file in addition to data from each individual experiment.  Contractor shall provide cost estimates for 300 samples per array and per array services which would include: - total RNA QC - delivery of RNA QC report - cRNA preparation, labeling, and QC - cRNA hybridization to Agilent zebrafish array - scanning of hybridized microarray - data extraction and QC - delivery of raw data.

<DESC>Amendment No. A00001 is issued in order to change a requirement for proposal submission, to provide questions received from prospective offerors and the Government’s response to those questions, and to extend the date for receipt of offerors. 
A.  The requirement for submitting a copy of the offeror’s current Repair/Spare Parts List as a part of the proposal is changed to read:  The offeror must provide, as a part of the proposal response, a copy of the manufacturer’s suggested current Spare Parts Kit List for each UPS unit listed in the Statement of Work.  If an offeror is unsuccessful in obtaining the Spare Parts Kit List from a particular manufacturer, the offeror shall so indicate in their proposal response and shall indicate the manner in which they propose on charging the Government for spare parts not shown in a manufacturer’s Spare Parts Kit List.  
B.  Questions received from prospective offerors and the Government’s responses follow.  
(1)  QUESTION:  Is the Monthly Preventative Maintenance (Item No. 001) for both the UPS Systems and Batteries?  Is there a specific Scope of Work that is required for the monthly UPS System Maintenance and a specific Scope of Work that is required for the monthly Battery Maintenance?  ANSWER:  As specified in the Statement of Work contained in the RFQ, under paragraph 1.0 General, the maintenance shall be performed on the equipment and the associated batteries and they shall be maintained in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) maintenance specifications and schedules.  (2)  QUESTION:  Item No. 002 is for Remedial Maintenance, based on hourly rates, to include any repair/spare parts.  It also states that it will be awarded as an estimated NTE amount.  Are prospective offerors to estimate what the cost for repair parts are going to be and work this cost into their proposed hourly rates or provide this cost as a separate cost from the labor rates?  ANSWER:  Offerors are to provide loaded hourly rates for remedial maintenance which are performed during and outside the PPM, to include associated travel costs.  No costs for repair parts are to be included in the hourly rates.  As specified in the RFQ and as amended by this A00001, offerors are to provide a copy of the current manufacturer’s suggested Spare Parts Kit List for each UPS unit listed in the Statement of Work as a part of their response to the RFQ.  Should any repair/spare parts be needed during the life of the contract, the Government will use the successful Contractor’s Spare Parts Kit List to verify the proposed cost for any required repair/spare parts.  The cost for the remedial maintenance and any required repair/spare parts will be reimbursed under Item No. 002.  At the time of award and based on the availability of current fiscal year funds, the Government will provide funding in a 1 LOT, Estimated, Not-To-Exceed amount to cover costs associated with Item No. 002, to include succeeding option years.  Basically, remedial maintenance is performed and reimbursed on a time-and-material basis.  (3)  QUESTION:  Are batteries included as repair/spare parts?  Most of the UPS Systems have sealed batteries that usually last 4-6 years.  Who will cover the cost for a full battery replacement?  Do you have the date codes for the batteries in each of the UPS Systems, as that information will be needed to determine replacement costs?  ANSWER:  All required battery replacement is handled under the Remedial Maintenance requirements.  Therefore, the Government will cover the cost of battery replacement, on an as-needed basis and reimbursement will be effected under Item No. 002.  As such, date codes for the batteries should not be required.  The Government expects the successful Contractor to provide recommendations, based upon the preventive maintenance performed on the batteries, as to when it appears the batteries should be replaced.  (4)  QUESTION:  How does FEMA anticipate the Contractors to quote the various types of equipment under the RFQ?  The specifications state per OEM specifications.  Some of the OEM’s do not exist anymore and FEMA will receive quotes based on how the quoting Contractor “thinks” they should service the equipment?

ANSWER:  Technical Evaluation Factor A requires that Contractor’s “must show demonstrated experience and competence in maintaining UPS units of the make and type listed.”  Each Contractor should include sufficient information in their proposal to allow the Government to verify their experience and competence with the equipment listed in the RFQ.  (5)  QUESTION:  Can a Top Secret Facility Clearance be obtained after award?  The requirement “prior” to award date may eliminate many “qualified service providers.”  ANSWER:  As stated in the solicitation, in order to provide a response to the RFQ, offerors must possess a current Top Secret Facility Clearance as well as have Top Secret cleared service technicians available to perform the work at the time of proposal submission.  This is a valid requirement since many of the UPS units to be maintained are located in an area that requires Top Secret clearance for entry into the area.  (6)  QUESTION:  What kind of spare parts, if any, does FEMA have on site for this equipment?  ANSWER:  The Government maintains a limited stock of spare parts for most, but not all of the listed equipment.  These mostly consist of spare fuses, cooling fans and air filters, but some control circuit boards and silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR’s) are stocked for some units.  If the parts are available, they may be provided to the Contractor for remedial repair work in lieu of purchasing new parts from the Contractor.    (7)  QUESTION:  Has this equipment been under a maintenance contract previously?  If so, for how long and with who?  ANSWER:  The incumbent Contractor is Static Power Conversion Services, Inc., Columbia, MD.  The contract has been in place since 7/27/2000 and expires on 07/31/2005.  All the units listed in the RFQ except Units A, P, Q, R, & S are covered by the current contract.  Of these, Units A, Q, R, & S have recently come out of warranty.  Unit P is still under warranty.  (8)  QUESTION:  Is there an existing software suite that is utilized in the preparation/maintenance of preventive maintenance schedules?  If so, is that software kept on a classified or unclassified system?  If so, what is the name of the software suite?  ANSWER:  The Government is not currently using any software for maintenance purposes.  (9)  QUESTION:  Is there an internal, 24-hour hotline for emergency maintenance requests?  ANSWER:  The Government has a maintenance request hotline for normal duty hours and an alternate number for non-duty hours.  (10)  QUESTION:  Are current operations and maintenance manuals maintained for the UPS systems included in the RFQ?  If not, should the development of operations and maintenance manuals be included as an alternate in the response?  ANSWER:  It is the responsibility of the successful Contractor to provide/obtain all necessary O&M information in order to perform the necessary maintenance services.  However, as stated in paragraph 1.2 of the Statement of Work – Maintenance Limitations, the Government understands that full maintenance services may not be available from one Contractor for each type of UPS equipment listed due to the variety of UPS equipment manufacturers included in the Statement of Work.  If there are any such limitations, they should be listed in detail in the offeror’s proposal, as stated in paragraph 1.2 of the Statement of Work.  C.  The date and time for receipt of proposals is changed from 3:00 PM/EST, 05/18/2005 to read 3:00 PM/EST, 06/01/2005.  END OF AMENDMENT NO. A00001 TO RFQ NO. HSFEMW-05-Q-0014

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being requested for quotation RFQ-10611-0026-5.  The North American Industrial Classification Code System (NAICS) is 332311.  The size standard is 500 employees.  This is 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The Government intends to make a single award for a firm fixed price order to a responsive/responsible quoter who submits the most advantageous offer to the Government based on price and price related factors.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations have the right to submit quotes equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.  

STATEMENT OF WORK

The Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, North Carolina, is soliciting quotes for the purchase of  the material to construct a 60' x 80' clear span metal building type structure with a standalone shed, 16' x 60', attached to one side of the building for the use of landscape equipment storage.  The shed will be an extension of the roof line 16 feet on one side of the building; there will be no walls on the shed; the rear wall will be the sidewall that it abuts to.
