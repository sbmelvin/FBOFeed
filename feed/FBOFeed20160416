qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures  must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

The design of this part is
unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate   that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are   contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated
marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited
acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration
changes. The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.   Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items is being solicited. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability
statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all
proposals received within 03 days after date of publication of this synopsis
will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to  compete this contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely
within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a
competitive procurement. The time required for approval of a new source is
normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based  on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This
brochure can be obtained at "
https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps" or by e-mailing the NAVSUP Buyer. If your request for source approval is currently being
evaluated at NAVSUP, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that
forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous  submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a   source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or  approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to   meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue
based on Fleet support needs. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the Buyer, Rachel Sprinkle at Rachel.sprinkle@navy.mil.
