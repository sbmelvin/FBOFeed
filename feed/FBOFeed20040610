SPECIFICATIONS:


USDA, AMS, Cotton Program requests budgetary pricing for a cotton loose removal system as described in this document for the Quality Assurance Branch located at 3275 Appling Road Memphis, Tennessee. Quotes submitted must be in accordance with this announcement, federal, state, and local regulations.  

The selection of source for the cotton loose removal system will be based on cost first, ability to show reliability and ease of maintenance second, and reputation of distributor/manufacturer third.

DEFINITIONS

Contractor -	as referred to in this document shall designate the company awarded the contract for providing and installing the specified system.

Cotton Loose Removal System   -	as referred to in this document denotes a system that utilizes a high pressure closed vacuum consisting of high pressure piping, valves, controls, separator, exhauster, etc. for a complete working system.

Cotton Samples  - as referred to in this document denotes a cotton sample consisting of two portions, each portion is approximately six (6) inches wide, twelve (12) inches long and four (4) inches deep.  Each portion weighs approximately four (4) ounces for a total sample weight of eight (8) ounces.

Process Described

The Quality Assurance Branch contains instruments and classers that test, grade and dispose of approximately 1000 cotton samples per hour.  The Quality Assurance Branch contains 14 instrument stations that test and dispose of a small portion of the sample.  There are 8 manual classer stations of which predominantly only 4 dispose of the entire sample.  However, on occasion all 8 stations would be required to dispose of samples based on the daily cotton grading demands.  The workstations combined will dispose of approximately 500-700 pounds of cotton per hour.  Although the majority of the entire sample is disposed of at the classer station, there are times that the instrument station will be required to dispose of the entire sample.  Therefore, the loose system shall provide the flexibility of disposing of an entire sample at either workstation.  Both of the workstations are able to accommodate the holding of approximately two or three samples prior to disposal.  Therefore, the system shall empty each of the workstations in the required amount of time so as to limit the amount of samples that are accumulated between evacuations to only three.  The loose removal system at each of the workstations shall be controlled by a timed sequence activation of the valves through some type of automated control system via a PLC.  A manual push button device at the HVI and classer workstations is not acceptable.

Three additional loose removal stations (floor sweeps) shall be provided in three separate rooms for the manual removal of waste cotton that is accumulated on the floor.  The classing lab, receiving room and the bale press room shall contain the floor sweeps.  The three additional stations shall be manually controlled by a push button or similar device that shall be designed to work in conjunction with the automated loose removal described above for the HVI and classer workstations.  The additional loose removal stations shall be able to accommodate the same size of sample that was outlined in the previous paragraph.

The Quality Assurance Branch is required to operate under various scenarios based on the samples that are to be tested.  This requires a great deal of flexibility within their lab.  The following scenarios must be provided for in the design of flexibility of the installed loose removal system.  A design layout and procedure shall be submitted prior to the award to verify that these requirements are satisfied.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has tested the cotton samples, the samples are transported into the receiving room and discarded at a central dumpstation.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for HVI testing.  Once the samples are tested, they are transported to the manual classing station.  After the samples have received a manual classification, they are discarded at the manual classer station.  There are four to eight manual classer stations that shall be used at various times for the disposal of the cotton samples.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has completed the testing, the samples are discarded at the HVI workstation.  There are 14 HVI workstations that shall be capable of discarding the entire sample.



Installation Requirement

The piping and valve installation in the classing lab shall adhere to the following requirements.  The piping and valves shall be installed within the constraints of the above ground conveyor system and the finished floor level.  It shall also be contained within the support frames of the conveyor.  The piping shall be attached to the floor or frame of the conveyor to provide a stationary installation.  These dimensions are approximately 34 inches wide by 20 inches tall.  Each valve shall accommodate the loose removal for two workstations.  The piping in the receiving room shall turn into the trench within 4 feet of the separating wall of the lab and receiving room.  The underground trench is approximately 4 feet deep by 4 feet wide and contains a belt conveyance system that is approximately 2 feet tall and 3 feet wide.  The piping shall not interfere with the sample flow on the trench as it will be maintained for a backup system to the newly installed air loose removal system.

The installation shall provide for the utilization of the trench conveyance system as a backup system.  Therefore the conveyance system and the air system shall be designed and installed to allow both systems to simultaneously feed into the Quality Assurance bale press in the event of a malfunction of the Classing Office bale press.  This shall require some additional sheet metal work in the Quality Assurance bale press in the form of a slide or chute that will feed the cotton into the bale press and allow the conveyor to cross feed onto the slide or into a chute.

The receiver tanks will be suspended above the baler on an 8’x 20’ platform with access ladder and guard rails.  The system will be PLC controlled with panel mounted operator interface for adjustment of CYCLE TIME, TANK DUMP TIME, and FLOOR FILTER CLEAN TIME.  The 36”x 36” x 8” NEMA 12 panel will also include vacuum exhauster controls fire protection interlock with dry contacts, and vacuum exhauster surge controls.

The exhauster and the secondary filter shall be mounted on the floor of the bale press room.  The exhaust air from the exhauster shall be piped outside the building from the bale press room within close proximity of the exhauster.   These locations shall be approved by a USDA representative prior to installation.

<CONTACT>RECLAMATION SERVICE CENTER   ;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sephton Water Technology, 23782 Connecticut, Unit #3, Hayward, CA 94545.  The requirement consists of a pilot test to demonstrate the feasibility of using waste steam from a geothermal powerplant to drive a Vertical Tube Evaporator (VTE) desalination system.  In addition to verifying the use of geothermal waste steam for this purpose, the test will resolve questions about how salts, nutrients, selenium, and other contaminants separate when Sea water is evaporated in a VTE.  The Government also anticipates that the test will provide the baseline data needed for geo-chemical modeling studies of the concentrate reject from the VTE for disposal into the geothermal aquifer. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  Sephton Water Technology is the only firm with the test equipment as well as the knowledge and expertise needed to successfully perform this job, which will require the use of Sephton's patented seeded slurry mode of brine concentration to control scale formation in the VTE (US Patent No's 5,156,706; 5,968,312; and 6,309,513). Any firm that believes it can furnish the items described above and possesses the required technical expertise are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements and possess the requisite technical expertise.   All responses received within 45 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: golivas@do.usbr.gov or by E-mail at golivas@do.usbr.gov.   Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard of less than 500 employees for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710.  If the business size is small, please indicate socioeconomic status.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) A04-027 for Terrorism Risk Insurance Claims Review/Audit Services on or about June 24, 2004 to solicit proposals for claims audit services (this is not a financial audit) that will enable Treasury to assure adherence to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the Act), compliance with the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, and the operating efficiency and financial integrity of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP). This work will be coordinated with and complement the work of the TRIP Claims Management Contractor responsible for receiving and processing insurer requests for compensation for insured losses following a certified act of terrorism. This effort will also require review of the processes and procedures used by the Claims Management Contractor in the processing of insurer submissions.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR COMMERCIAL PHYSICIAN SERVICES AT THE ARMED FORCES RETIREMENT HOME IN GULFPORT, MS.  BACKGROUND: The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate Federal Agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510.  The AFRH is comprised of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, D.C. (AFRH-W), and the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi (AFRH-G).  Each site offers independent, Long-Term Care/Skilled Care, Assisted Living and Special Care (dementia) options for its residents.  Each site is maintained as a separate establishment of the AFRH for administrative purposes.  This contract applies only to AFRH-G.  
The mission of the AFRH is to provide residents with a model retirement center, where residents can maintain an independent lifestyle in an environment designed for safety, comfort, and personal enrichment.  
The total number of residents on the rolls of the AFRH-G will vary from month to month, but not widely, as influenced by admissions, deaths, and separations.  The actual number to be medical care recipients will also be influenced by the number who are on leave or who may be patients at an outside medical facility. AFRH-G currently has 590 residents but can support up to 620.  Medicare Part A does not cover all of these residents nor does AFRH-G receive reimbursement from Medicare Part A.  Residents’ physical and mental conditions and capabilities vary widely.  SCOPE:   The Contractor shall provide the full range of medical care, comprehensive professional, clinical and medical services, in a geriatric environment.  This includes both an Ambulatory Care Outpatient Clinic (hereafter referred to as “clinic”) and inpatient (“bed side”) services to non-ambulatory residents.  The majority of the clinic’s patients (approximately 485) reside in the AFRH “Tower” and are enriched/independent residents.  Residents from the Long-Term/Skilled Care (inpatients) Assisted Living, and Special Care (dementia) units may also use the clinic.  Inpatient physician coverage applies to Long-Term Care/Skilled Care (LTCU), Assisted Living (ALU) and Special Care (dementia) units.  (At AFRH-G, Assisted Living has two categories; Assisted Living on the Assisted Living floor of the Tower facility and “Popcorn Assisted Living” which is Assisted Living residents in the section of the Tower for independents).  Total population in these three categories at the AFRH-G is approximately 105.  
Breakout of the population of each unit is:  Long-Term Care/Skilled Care Range 15 – 24; Assisted Living Floor approximately 56 and Popcorn Assisted Living approximately 15  
Special Care (dementia)Range 15-24.  These numbers will change due to near term construction of additions to the Long-Term Care/Skilled Care and Special Care (dementia) areas.  At final capacity in 2006, Long-Term Care/Skilled Care and Special Care (dementia) areas will be 48.  Additionally, planned growth in the Assisted Living Program will impact the site population.  The actual increase in Assisted Living numbers is currently unknown as the population of Popcorn Assisted Living residents is still to be determined.  The Contractor shall also provide a Medical Director (Government's option of full-time or part-time) and ancillary duties, such as but not limited to, clinics, records and documentation, and billing of insurance.  The Contractor shall bill the residents’ insurance company directly for reimbursement of physician services.  This shall include the cost of expendable/consumable supplies consumed during resident treatment.  Residents and/or their insurance companies will be responsible for payment of all services including co-payments.  The Government is not responsible for payment, including co-payments, and the Contractor shall not bill the Government for these services.  SITE VISIT:  A site visit of the clinic is scheduled for Friday, June 18, 2004 at 1:00 p.m.CST at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, MS.  You must contact the Contracting Officer via email not-later-than noon on June 17,2004 with the company's name and attendees to ensure entrance through the security gate.  A HARD-COPY SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  ANTICIPATED DATE FOR RELEASE OF SOLICITATION ONTO THE FBO WEBSITE IS NLT JUNE 14, 2004.

<DESC>The Government anticipates the acquisition of one (1) each Sentinel Enhanced Target, Range and Classification (ETRAC) Virtual Maintenance Trainer (SEVMT) Development and one (1) each Sentinel Training System (STS) ETRAC Upgrade to support the Sentine l Radar System on a sole source basis from Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS) Company. TRS the designer/developer of the Sentinel ETRAC Radar System, has proprietary rights in the Sentinel ETRAC radar technical data and is the only qualified provider of the SEV MT development and the upgrade of the STS for that system. The SEVMT, a computer based training (CBT), interactive multimedia instruction (IMI) device, will be developed in such a manner as to make it representative of the ETRAC Sentinel configuration and will be used by the Ordnance Munitions and Electronics Maintenance School (OMEMS) 	at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to train Sentinel maintainers in troubleshooting and diagnostics of the Sentinel ETRAC radar.  The STS ETRAC Upgrade, located at Fort Bliss, Texas, wi ll be modified to a dual configuration.  It will allow the device to train both the Basic Sentinel system and the ETRAC Sentinel system without adversely impacting the existing courseware.  Additionally, the STS will be modified so that those switch functi ons that are associated with the ETRAC radar and are required to support training are fully integrated into the software and courseware.   The Government does not own the TDP or the software documentation needed for competition of this requirement.    All interested sources may submit their responses/concerns to Mrs. Jackie Westmoreland (256) 876-7471, Contract Specialist; or Ms. Debra K. Long (256) 876-4153, Contracting Officer.  (See Note 2)

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
Engineering Support for the ITS Program

Scope

THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.   A non-profit organization is one which is not organized primarily for profit but which is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest, and which uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, and/or expand it operations.  The contract resulting from this procurement will provide the engineering support to the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  The ITS program is a research and development activity budgeted at approximately $100 million annually, and it encompasses the entire range of technologies currently known as ITS.

The incumbent contractor currently providing this support is the Mitretek Corporation, under Contract No. DTFH61-00-C-00001.  Mitretek is eligible to compete under the new procurement here synopsized.  

Special Requirements

The contractor will have access to a variety of sensitive material as a result of the support activities.  Typically the contactor will be involved in the following types of program activities:

1	Technical support in the development of Statements of Work and specifications for projects.
2	Evaluation of proposals submitted to execute the projects.
3	Development of program plans for areas of ITS research.
4	Monitoring of contractors’ performance in the execution of projects.
5	Technical evaluation of contractors’ work products resulting from these projects.
6	Technical analyses that are required to develop a project plan prior to the issuance of a solicitation for the project.
7	Provision of technical advice on the state of the art in certain technologies.

Because of the crucial need for impartiality as well as the APPEARANCE of impartiality in the performance of such work, each PRIME offeror (and the resulting PRIME contractor) must be a non-profit organization.  Profit-oriented INDIVIDUALS operating as INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS, may, however, be proposed by any offeror and may be used by the contractor.  The contractor must agree to NOT compete for ANY commercial ITS work, whether it be for a private or public entity seeking that work, during the Period of Performance of this contract and for one year thereafter.


Personnel Requirements

It is anticipated that this procurement will require approximately 80,000 AGGREGATE staffing hours of effort annually.  The personnel should be fundamentally systems engineers with a working knowledge of ITS systems.  The technical experience and background of the personnel will encompass at least the following disciplines:

	Traffic Engineering
	Modeling and system analysis
	Traffic Signal control Systems
	ITS Architecture
Public Transit Systems
Public Safety Systems
Collision Avoidance technologies
Evaluation of Project Effectiveness
Commercial Vehicle systems (CVISN)
ITS Standards and Standards Development Procedures
Communications Technologies
Traveler Information Systems
Transportation Safety Technologies

It is anticipated that AT LEAST one principal engineer with at least 10 years of experience will be required in each of the above disciplines.  It is estimated that the contract will include a total of about 15 or 16 different individuals occupying the position of principal engineer.  Since this work is aimed at assisting the ITS JPO in formulating the ITS program, the task requires that at least half of the technical staff (i.e., persons employed below the level of principal engineer) be senior people with more than five years of experience in at least one (and preferably in several) of the above disciplines.

The personnel categories required are as follows:

Principal Engineers -----------------------  30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
A principal engineer will have an advanced degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or physics and at least ten years of experience.  The principal engineer will be expected to be capable of leading a group of engineers in the development of program plans and recommending technical options to the JPO staff.


Senior Engineers  ----------------------30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
          A senior engineer will have a degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or civil engineering.  However, a civil engineer must have prior experience in the implementation of ITS technologies.  Senior personnel are expected to be able to coordinate projects and provide seasoned judgment for the JPO staff.

Junior Staff  -------------------------------15,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
	Junior staff members are expected to be degreed engineers who can perform analyses, research, and the evaluation of technical products. 

It is expected that administrative support will comprise about 6% of the total labor on these tasks, since administrative support of the JPO staff is not the objective of this procurement.  Accordingly:

Administrative Support-------------5,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.

All estimated numbers of aggregate hours as shown above are expressed as actual ON-THE-JOB hours.  The DUE DATE for the FHWA’s receipt of proposals, as shown above, is only an ESTIMATED due date.  The ACTUAL due date for receipt of proposals will be shown hereafter in the SOLICITATION (RFP) No. DTFH61-04-R-00029, that will be published in this same FedBizOpps web site.  Prospective offerors are strongly advised to MONITOR this FedBizzOpps web site on a regular basis in order to look for any AMENDMENTS to this Synopsis, that might be published hereafter.

<DESC>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the only continuing source of nationally representative information about the status and progress of student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12 in the United States.  The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) oversees and sets policy for NAEP.  In March 2004, the Governing Board received a report from a blue-ribbon Commission recommending the implementation of "bold and dramatically new incentives to increase the participation of high schools and 12th grade students in NAEP and the motivation of 12th grade students to do their best on NAEP."  The Governing Board is evaluating this recommendation and is seeking a contractor to assist in identifying barriers to participation, solutions for overcoming the barriers, and ways to assure that 12th grade students participating in NAEP try their best.  Outcomes of this work will be recommendations for a communications plan with high school principals, teachers, and students selected for the NAEP sample to improve school and student participation in 12th grade NAEP and to foster in 12th grade students selected for the sample the inclination to "try hard" on NAEP.  NAICS codes 541613 and 541910 are also applicable to this procurement.  The period of performance shall be from date of contract award through March 30, 2005.

All requests for the RFP shall reference the RFP number ED-04-R-0029.  The anticipated release date of this RFP is on or about June 25, 2004 and the closing date is July 26, 2004.  The RFP can be retrieved using any of the following methods:

The Statement of Work will appear on the NAGB website, http://www.nagb.org on or after June 25, 2004.

Telephone requests should be placed by calling (202) 357-0392 or (202) 357-6938.

Fax requests may be sent to (202) 357-6945.

Written requests should be sent to the address shown above as Contracting Office Address, attention Stephen Swearingen.

<SUBJECT>A -- Modular Guidance Architecture (Modular IMU) Research and Development
<SOLNBR>FA8204-04-R-AAAG
<ARCHDATE>09102004
<CONTACT>Trina Andreasen, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-777-5928, Fax 801-586-0700, Email trina.andreasen@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice to announce the pending issuance of a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) for the Long Range Planning Branch of the Global Deterrence and Strike Program Office (OO-ALC/LMX) within the ICBM System Program Office (OO-ALC/LM).  LMX is seeking firms to conduct research and development of innovative concepts and technologies in the field of Modular Guidance Architecture (Modular IMU).  THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTICE AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE ANY EXPENSES INCURRED BY CONTRACTORS RESPONDING TO THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.

The objective of this project is to develop and mature technologies for future modular strategic missile guidance systems.  This effort should leverage ongoing government development activities in navigation and guidance instruments or contractor Independent Research and Development (IRAD) efforts, as appropriate.  Priorities include:  increased accuracy, decreased cost of ownership (low production cost, very high MTBF), modularity, and decreased weight.

The inertial instruments are a major driver in accuracy, cost, modularity, and weight in the guidance system.  It is anticipated that technology improvements will make future accelerometers/gyroscopes preferable to those chosen for initial fielding of a system.  Current guidance system architectures are highly integrated, and, therefore, insertion of individual inertial instruments that use new technologies has proven too complicated and costly.  It is desired that new guidance systems use a modular architecture that will enable affordable replacement of inertial instrument components.
GOVERNMENT EXPECTATIONS
It is expected that program participants will conduct analyses, perform trade studies, conduct simulations, and develop a concept(s) to meet objectives for strategic missile guidance systems.  In addition, the contractor may evaluate alternate concepts and identify technologies requiring further development.  The contractor is expected to develop, construct, and demonstrate proof of concept hardware and software. 

This effort will consist of two phases, as follows:

Phase I: Trade Study and Design
Conduct trade studies and design efforts to develop an objective system concept(s).  Recommend adjustments, where appropriate, to the goals and thresholds specified.  Identify and assess technology risks, and formulate a mitigation strategy.  Design a proof of concept modular guidance architecture test-bed that integrates multiple inertial instruments and demonstrates the accuracy, cost, modularity and weight improvements associated with the concept.  Forecast accuracy, cost, modularity, and weight improvements that would be expected from an objective system that implemented these concepts.

Phase II: Proof of Concept Test-bed Demonstration
Program participants will construct a proof of concept modular guidance architecture test-bed and conduct laboratory level tests to demonstrate project objectives by the end of 2007.  

TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
Accuracy:  Threshold: less than Peacekeeper CEP.  Goal: less than 0.8 Peacekeeper CEP. 
(Total operational CEP, including all error sources reduced, at 5000 Nmi range and 28 degree reentry angle.)  Global Positioning System (GPS) is not expected to be required.  Allowance for the later addition of a GPS receiver is desirable, as well as the ability to delay release of the Reentry Vehicles (RVs) in order to minimize the separation errors’ contribution to CEP if GPS is added.
Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):  Threshold: greater than 50,000 hrs, including any required ground cooling equipment. Goal: greater than 100,000 hrs, including any required ground cooling equipment.
Nuclear Survivability:  Threshold and Goal:  Retain current Nuclear Hardness requirements.
Modularity: Ensure overall system compatibility (e.g., connections etc…)
Weight: Threshold: 225 lbs maximum. Goal: 150 lbs maximum. The weight for the guidance system includes the IMU, mission computer, cables, battery, power distribution, and downstage control amplifiers required to drive the post boost and boost control systems, assuming the current MM III solid booster stack is retained. The weight of the structure is allocated to the propulsion subsystem, and is, therefore, not included in these weights.
Technology Maturity: This effort is intended to mature IMU technologies and concepts to achieve the above objectives.  It is envisioned this effort will enable the Technology Development phase for potential future programs.  A concept demonstration test-bed is expected to be produced and tested, demonstrating these concepts in a laboratory environment by the end of FY 2007.  The technology readiness level (TRL) achievable in this period is to be proposed and discussed by the contractor.   A minimum TRL level of 5 is expected by the end of FY 2007. The offerors shall provide in their proposal what they believe to be the current TRL level of their architecture and what TRL level they expect to achieve in this project by the end of FY07.

DELIVERABLES 
Monthly Reports:  Provide status.  Identify and analyze cost, schedule, and performance risks, to include assessment of potential impacts.  Propose risk mitigation, to include corrective actions and expected results, to ensure project achieves technical objectives within the projected cost and schedule constraints. Monthly status reports shall provide the Government adequate financial controls and insight to contract execution, addressing planned, actual, and forecasted expenditures, with cost to complete the basic/option.
Reviews:  Technical reviews will be conducted at key program milestones to be proposed by the contractor in order provide the government insight into technical, financial, and schedule performance and risk. Additional technical meetings may be required for coordination and planning.  A final review will be conducted to review results and recommendations.  Following the review and discussions, action items and issues will need to be addressed and entered into a final report that is due no later than 30 days after the final review.
Final Report:  A final report, including final, comprehensive technical results, analyses, and recommendations, will be submitted at the completion of phases I and II.  The phase I report will include a plan and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for phase II.

ELIGIBILITY
All firms with current applicable experience in strategic missile systems may submit white papers.  Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not authorized for this acquisition.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.1102 – Policy all prospective contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to award of a contract or agreement:  http:www.ccr.gov 

SUBMITTAL

<DESC>The work of this contract consists of the repair of five concrete low water crossings located along the unpaved road to Echo Park.  Work consists of the demolition and replacement of one of the five low water crossings and the repair of the other four low water crossings.  Replacement work includes removing or rubblizing the existing concrete pavement, construction of concrete side aprons/walls, and construction of a new concrete pavement for one of the low water crossings.  Repair work includues redpairing cracks and spalled areas, construction of concrete side aprons/walls for four of the existing concrete pavement low water crossings.  At one of the low water crossings to be repaired, work includes extending the concrete pavement, to include installing base material and new concrete pavement.  Four of the low water crossings are located along Pool Creek, which will require diversion during construction at each location.  All five low water crossings will require the clearing of vegetation and the excavation and backfill of earth materials.  Bid additives are inlcuded to replace rather than repair three of the low water crossings. Due to the remoteness of this project, pre-bid on-site inspection by the bidding party is highly recommended so that vendor will be able to grasp complexity of logistics of project.  For a site visit, please contact Gary Mott at 970-374-3031. Estimated Cost Range $50,000.00 to $150,000.00

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT, POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the Federal agency responsible for conducting and supporting research on the brain and nervous system.  It is a component of the National Institutes of Health and the US Public Health Service. Medical advances in the field of neurology have burgeoned in the past several years.  Neurological illnesses which were once considered untreatable are now being treated. Acting on a mandate by Congress to bring important health messages to the public, the NINDS requires a public education strategy, and public education programs, on the topics of stroke and Parkinsons disease, and other neurological diseases as the need arises. The NINDS was established by Public Law 81-692 in August 1950 with a mission of research to improve the quality of life. Along with the aging population there has been a marked increase in the diagnosis of a number of neurological disorders, including stroke and Parkinsons disease. The public needs information about research advances in the neurological disorders in order to take full advantage of treatments and health care practices that may improve their quality of life. Another imperative is communicating changes in standards of treatment to health care professionals. 

The NIH Director places a strong emphasis on the importance of collaboration between the public and private sectors. In his Roadmap, he calls for novel partnerships, such as those between the public and private sectors, to accelerate the movement of scientific discoveries from the bench to the bedside.  At the core of this vision is the concept that clinical research needs to develop new partnerships among organized patient communities, community-based physicians and academic researchers. Toward this end, the NINDS seeks a contractor to identify and seek out opportunities to partner with groups that will help extend the NIH scientific research agenda. 

Within the NINDS, the Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) holds the lead responsibility for educational activities and translating research findings for both health practitioners and the general public. The OCPL plans to award a single, incrementally funded, cost reimbursement completion contract for five years.   As an incentive to performance, the contract is further issued as an award term contract, allowing the contractor to earn two additional years to the contract as a result of superior performance. The contractor will provide services in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of health communication products and activities, development of intermediary networks and materials development for professional audiences.  Such services include but are not limited to the following: 1)  Planning, development, implementation and evaluation of public education/communication programs on the topics of stroke and Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders as research advances require; 2)  Development and maintenance of intermediary networks of neurological related health institutions, organizations, associations and businesses; 3)  Materials development for professional audiences.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately 15 days after publication of this notice, and proposals will be due approximately 35 days after the issue date.  RFP N02-NS-59000-09 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home page by using the following Internet address: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/  and clicking on Current Requests for Proposals.  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact is Mary E. Landi OLeary; electronic mail address: ml186r@nih.gov  (ML-one-86r); phone 301-435-3807; fax 301-480-0309.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Virginia announces a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the preparation of nutrient management plans.  The process will involve meeting with farm operators and developing plans for the applications of nutrients in the form of commercially obtained fertilizer and/or animal manures.  Proposals are sought for two areas in Virginia which are:

Service Unit Area #1 consisting of the counties of Frederick, Clarke, Warren, Shenandoah, Page, Rockingham, and Augusta.

Service Unit #5 consisting of the counties of Westmoreland, Northumberland, Richmond, Lancaster, Middlesex, Mathews, Gloucester, Essex, King and Queen, King William, Hanover, Henrico, New Kent, Charles City, James City and York.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

Nutrient management plans are required by NRCS as a component of conservation plans developed to the Resource Management System (RMS) level of treatment and as a component of a Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan (CNMP) to address conservation needs of livestock operations.  Nutrient management planning requires a field visit and discussions with the producer, current soil test information (less than three years old), yield results, field specific information on environmentally sensitive information, calculations of soil loss and P-Index if animal manures or bio solids are used on the tract, appropriate analyses of manure or organic nutrient source, development of a plan document and delivery and explanation of the plan to the producer.  All nutrient management plans must be consistent with other conservation practices planned for the tract.  Consultation with NRCS to review planned conservation practices will be necessary to insure consistent recommendations to the producer.

For all fields receiving animal manures or biosolids, a field risk assessment will be performed in accordance with NRCS Nutrient Management Standard #590.  The planner will evaluate the current soil test results to perform this risk assessment.  If the soil test results indicate a phosphorous level less than twenty (20) percent saturation (Mehlich 1 test), the planner will be allowed to base organic fertilizer recommendations on the nitrogen requirements of the desired crop.  If the soil saturation level is greater than sixty five (65) percent (Melich 1 test), no additional phosphorous applications will be allowed.  For all soil test results between twenty (20) and sixty five (65) percent, the planner will be required to calculate the desired target application level by the use of the Phosphorous Index.  The current version of the P-Index for Virginia (developed by Virginia Tech) will be the only acceptable methods.  If an updated version is released during the contract period, all new plans currently not started will be completed using the new version.

Plan format and content will be consistent with providing all information necessary to meet Commonwealth of Virginia Nutrient Management regulations 4 VAC 5-15-140 (Nutrient Management Plan Content).  The use of state developed nutrient management software is encouraged but not required.  The use of GIS produced field maps is permitted. All plans will be signed by a nutrient management planner certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia.  In addition, all plans will be signed by the producer indicating that the plan has been developed, delivered, and explained.

It is estimated that plans will be written for approximately 15,000 acres.  The government contemplates the award of one or more multiple firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  Tasks may be directed based on qualifications of the firms.  Firms will be permitted to submit proposals for single counties listed within the Service Unit Areas as well as all counties listed.  It is anticipated that the contract period will be from contract award through September 30, 2005.  This will be a performance based service contract.  The government shall place orders totaling a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $150,000. Task orders will be negotiated for individual plan development on individual tracts, but the task order may cover multiple tracts for the same individual.

The person signing the plan must be currently certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Conservation and Recreation Nutrient Management program and prove experience in developing nutrient management plans.  A sample plan indicating prior performance is required in the RFP submission.  In addition, consideration will be given to the amount of planning (acres) a prospective firm indicates can be achieved in the contract time period.  
    
Firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in descending order of importance.  (1) Price (2) Specialized experience and technical competency in the type of planning required.  Evaluation will be based on the extent of directly related experience in developing nutrient management plans.  (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance.  (4) Capacity to accomplish the work.  Evaluation will be based upon the number of personnel available to produce plans, the quantity of work planned and the schedule of completion.  (5) Past performance on contracts with other government agencies to develop nutrient management plans including the quality and timeliness of performance under previous contracts.  References with telephone numbers must be provided.  (6) Location in the general geographic area.  Firms or individuals must indicate the Service unit area, county or counties for which they would like to be considered.
 
The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690. All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract (www.ccr.gov).  In addition, prior to award all firms must be listed as a Technical Service Provider (TSP) for nutrient management planning.  For information go to http://techreg.usda.gov.  The Request for Proposal will be available on or about June 15, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for NASA/GSFC Software Improvement Initiative Support.  This procurement is for purchasing engineering expertise in the areas of software measurement practices, Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) and related software process improvement methodology and change management, as well as specific mission software domain expertise. This procurement will provide support to NASA Headquarters, Code D, for the implementation of their NASA Software Initiative Implementation Plan and will also provide GSFC engineering support to assist GSFC in achieving CMMI Maturity Level 3.    NASA/GSFC intends to purchase these services from Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is Citation 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. The prospective follow-on procurement will be a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with a 5-year period of performance (1-year base and four 1-year options).  Currently this work is being performed under GSA Contract GS-35F-4381G, Delivery Order S-39989-G with CSC, which expires on July 1, 2004. During the FY03 and early FY04, CSC supported the detailed planning phases and early training of improvement teams. These teams then developed an infrastructure for improvement that included a comprehensive process documentation structure, templates, and procedures for process documentation, a process asset library, plans for training and other critical elements for moving forward with our aggressive improvement program. This background knowledge gained during the past several years of GSFC process improvement activities could not be replaced without significant cost and schedule impacts. In early FY04, under the direction of GSFC's Center Director, the schedules for achieving CMMI maturity level 3 were set, with the requirement for flight software to achieve maturity level 3 by the end of FY06 and for other mission software to achieve maturity level 3 by the end of FY07. This aggressive schedule does not allow time for another contractor to acquire the necessary and  required background information. Roughly 80 percent of GSFC’s software is contracted software, so one of the critical components of GSFC’s process improvement program will be to improve our software acquisition practices.	GSFC will be using the Software Engineering Institute’s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model (SA-CMM) in order to achieve these improvements.  CSC is the only contractor who has achieved Level 3 in SA-CMM, and thus is the only contractor who has experience in implementing the practices required to improve this extremely important area for GSFC.  In order to effectively carry out the process improvement work in the GSFC environment, a large amount of training is required in the areas of process improvement and process documentation. CSC has provided personnel with the training in the Introduction to CMMI, the Intermediate CMMI, SCAMPI Appraiser Team Training, Mastering Process Improvement, Defining World Class Processes, Software CMM, Software Engineering Process Group Workshop, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 12207, and Risk Management. This background of training is considered essential to provide the foundation for the activities required in this procurement. The CMM/CMMI classes are necessary to provide the detailed knowledge necessary to implement these models in the GSFC environment. Mastering Process Improvement, the Software Engineering Process Group Workshop and the Defining World Class Processes classes enhance the background knowledge required for the improvement and documentation approaches taken by GSFC to date. The training in Software CMM and IEEE 12207 provide required knowledge for the application of CMMI in the acquisition areas, which is one of the most important areas for GSFC. In order for another contractor to assume this work, similarly trained personnel would have to be provided in order to assure continuity in the current process improvement work.  Previous task performance has indicated that CSC has the ability to deliver quality performance/scope of the required activities for this contract on the defined schedule and within the defined budget. The use of any other contractor would require a significant learning curve, negatively impact schedule, and significantly raise costs.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ4060 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a business size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure a Chromatography System and Accessories.  The following instrument and products may be acquired under this acquisition: Item/Description/ Quantity: (1) Chromatography System with flow rates of 0.001 to 10ml/min at pressures up to 25 Mpa.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: JUNE 10, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04M000135

INTENDED SOURCE: VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH ONE YEAR

PURPOSE:

   THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES (DHHS), SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA)  THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER-DIVISION OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT  PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY.  CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 24, 2004

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO:

PURPOSE: 	

TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IN EDUCATING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH TREATMENT ISSUES SURROUNDING BUPRENORPHINE BY IMPLEMENTING A PROCESS OF INTEGRATING OPIOID ADDICTION TREATMENT INTO MAINSTREAM MEDICAL PRACTICE AND SPECIFICALLY, BUPRENORPHINE TREATMENT FOR OPIOID DEPENDENCE BY THE FACILITATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MODELS AIMED AT INCREASING PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE AND ENDORSEMENT OF THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT OPTION.

BACKGROUND:

ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY (ONDCP), THERE WERE AN ESTIMATED 810,000 TO 1,000,000 INDIVIDUALS ADDICTED TO HEROIN IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE YEAR 2000-WHICH IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE THE MID-TO-LATE 1970S.  NATIONALLY, OPIOID ANALGESICS WERE INVOLVED IN 14 PERCENT OF ALL DRUG-ABUSE RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN 2001 BASED ON DATA FROM THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION.  AN INCREASE IN THE RATES OF INJECTION DRUG USE HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE INCIDENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION, HEPATITIS B AND C, AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  
HISTORICALLY, A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTION OCCURRED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF METHADONE IN THE 1960S. METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROVED SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND ENABLED PATIENTS TO LEAD FUNCTIONAL LIVES.  WITHIN A FEW YEARS OF ITS INTRODUCTION, NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS EFFECTIVELY LIMITED METHADONE MAINTENANCE TREATMENT TO THE CONTEXT OF OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM (OTP) SETTINGS.  THE NEW SYSTEM MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR PHYSICIANS TO USE METHADONE TO TREAT OPIOID ADDICTION IN AN OFFICE-BASED SETTING OR IN A GENERAL DRUG REHABILITATION PROGRAM.  EFFORTS TO RETURN OPIOID ADDICTION TREATMENT TO THE MAINSTREAM OF MEDICAL CARE BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE IN THE 1990S.  IN OCTOBER 2000, THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000 WAS ENACTED INTO LAW.  TITLE XXV OF THE ACT PROVIDES A WAIVER AUTHORITY FOR PHYSICIANS WHO DISPENSE OR PRESCRIBE CERTAIN NARCOTIC DRUGS FOR MAINTENANCE TREATMENT OR DETOXIFICATION TREATMENT OF OPIOID-DEPENDENT PATIENTS.  THIS PART OF THE LAW IS KNOWN AS THE DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT OF 2000. 

FEDERAL LEGISLATION, TITLED THE DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT OF 2000, HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW PARADIGM FOR THE MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES.  NOW UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF DATA 2000, QUALIFYING PHYSICIANS IN MEDICAL OFFICES AND OTHER APPROPRIATE SETTINGS OUTSIDE OF THE OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM SYSTEM  MAY PRESCRIBE OR DISPENSE SCHEDULE III, IV, AND V OPIOID MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE IF SUCH MEDICATIONS HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR THAT INDICATION.  

THE DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT ACT OF 2000 PROVIDES EXPANDED WAIVER AUTHORITY FOR PHYSICIANS WHO DISPENSE OR PRESCRIBE CERTAIN NARCOTIC DRUGS FOR MAINTENANCE OR DETOXIFICATION TREATMENT OF OPIATE ADDICTION WITH THE GOAL OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE AND TO BEGIN TO NORMALIZE IT WITHIN HEALTHCARE BY PROVIDING FOR OFFICE-BASED TREATMENT.  

PHYSICIANS MUST BE QUALIFIED FOR THE WAIVER; FOR MOST OF IT INVOLVES PARTICIPATION IN AN APPROVED 8-HOUR TRAINING COURSE.  


OBJECTIVES:

TO IMPLEMENTING A PROCESS OF INTEGRATING OPIOID ADDICTION TREATMENT INTO MAINSTREAM MEDICAL PRACTICE BY DEVELOPING NEW MODELS OF INCREASING PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF TREATING OPIOID ADDICTION VIA BURPENORPHINE.

TO PROVIDE TRAININGS THAT WILL EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND CLINICIANS IN THE PRACTICAL USE OF BUPRENORPHINE IN OFFICE-BASED SETTINGS.

TO DEVELOPE A FOUR-PRONG APPROACH AIMED AT DEVELOPING A STATE-BASED PROGRAM OF EDUCATION THAT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WAIVER-ELIGIBLE PHYSICIANS.

TO FURNISH CSAT WITH A REPORT DETAILING THE CONTRACTOR'S ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

THE CONTRACTORS SHALL FURNISH THE NECESSARY PERSONNEL, FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES AND PERFORM THE WORK SET FORTH BELOW;

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

TASK 1: TO DEVELOP A FOUR-PRONGED APPROACH AIMED AT DEVELOPING A STATE-BASED PROGRAM OF EDUCATION THAT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WAIVER-ELIGIBLE PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

TASK 2: TO COORDINATE AND DELIVER FREE BUPRENORPHINE TRAININGS UTILIZING A CSAT-APPROVED CURRICULUM THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AT FOUR VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOLS DURING EACH YEAR OF SUPPORT.

TASK 3: TO PROVIDE TRAINING SETTINGS THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED BY PRACTITIONERS IN VIRGINIA AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

TASK 4: TO MARKET THE TRAININGS TO LOCAL PHYSICIANS, RESIDENTS, AND MEDICAL STUDENTS WITHIN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

TASK 5: TO PROVIDE TRAININGS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND CLINICIANS IN THE PRACTICAL USE OF BUPRENORPHINE IN OFFICE-BASED PRACTICE BY DEMONSTRATING AND REVIEWING A HANDS-ON SETTING IN WHICH THE CLINICIAN WILL OBSERVE THE PROCESS OF INDUCTION ON BUPRENORPHINE INCLUDING THE PATIENT INTERVIEW, ELIGIBILITY, DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS, OPIATE WITHDRAWAL ASSESSMENT, BUPRENORPHINE DOSING, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BUPRENORPHINE TREATMENT IN AN OFFICE BASED SETTING.

TASK 6: TO PROVIDE BUPRENORPHINE EXPERT ADVICE AND SUPPORT TO PRACTITIONERS WHO COMPLETE THE BUPRENORPHINE TRAINING VIA TELEPHONE AND EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS.

TASK 7: TO PROVIDE A PROGRAM EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL INCLUDE SURVEYS OF CLINICIANS COMPLETING THE OFFERED TRAINING TO DETERMINE PERCEPTION OF TRAINING QUALITY, LIKELIHOOD OF UNDERTAKING PRACTICE WITH BUPRENORPHINE, BARRIERS TO BUPRENORPHINE PRACTICE, NUMBERS OF TRAINEES WHO OBTAIN WAIVERS, NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBING BUPRENORPHINE, AND TREATMENT RENDERED.

TASK 8: TO PROVIDE A MONOGRAPH DESCRIBING THE PROGRAM AND ITS RESULTS.


SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

ON OCTOBER 17, 2000, THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000 WAS SIGNED INTO FEDERAL LAW.  SECTION 3502 OF THAT ACT SETS FORTH THE DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT OF 2000 (DATA). THIS LEGISLATION IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO STATE MEDICAL BOARDS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTION. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST A CENTURY, PHYSICIANS MAY TREAT OPIOID ADDICTION WITH OPIOID MEDICATIONS IN OFFICE-BASED SETTINGS. THESE OPIOID MEDICATIONS, SCHEDULES III, IV, AND V OPIOID DRUGS WITH FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVED INDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE, MAY BE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS UNDER CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. THIS NEW TREATMENT MODALITY MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR PHYSICIANS TO TREAT PATIENTS FOR OPIOID ADDICTION IN THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WITH THESE SCHEDULE III-V NARCOTIC CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SPECIFICALLY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT. PREVIOUSLY, FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRED THAT PATIENTS RECEIVING THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT BE REFERRED TO SPECIALIZED OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS (OTPS).

TO QUALIFY FOR A WAIVER UNDER DATA 2000 A LICENSED PHYSICIAN (MD OR DO) MUST MEET ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (1) THE PHYSICIAN HOLDS A SUBSPECIALTY BOARD CERTIFICATION IN ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY FROM THE AMERICAN BOARD OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES, (2) THE PHYSICIAN HOLDS AN ADDICTION CERTIFICATION FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE, (3) THE PHYSICIAN HOLDS A SUBSPECIALTY BOARD CERTIFICATION IN ADDICTION MEDICINE FROM THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION, (4) THE PHYSICIAN HAS, WITH RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID-ADDICTED PATIENTS, COMPLETED NOT LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS OF TRAINING (THROUGH CLASSROOM SITUATIONS, SEMINARS AT PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY MEETINGS, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, OR OTHERWISE) THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION, THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION THAT THE SECRETARY DETERMINES IS APPROPRIATE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBCLAUSE, (5) THE PHYSICIAN HAS PARTICIPATED AS AN INVESTIGATOR IN ONE OR MORE CLINICAL TRIALS LEADING TO THE APPROVAL OF A NARCOTIC DRUG IN SCHEDULE III, IV, OR V FOR MAINTENANCE OR DETOXIFICATION TREATMENT, AS DEMONSTRATED BY A STATEMENT SUBMITTED TO THE SECRETARY BY THE SPONSOR OF SUCH APPROVED DRUG, (6) THE PHYSICIAN HAS SUCH OTHER TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE AS THE STATE MEDICAL LICENSING BOARD (OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PHYSICIAN WILL PROVIDE MAINTENANCE OR DETOXIFICATION TREATMENT) CONSIDERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF THE PHYSICIAN TO TREAT AND MANAGE OPIOID-ADDICTED PATIENTS, AND (7) THE PHYSICIAN HAS SUCH OTHER TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE AS THE SECRETARY CONSIDERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF THE PHYSICIAN TO TREAT AND MANAGE OPIOID-ADDICTED PATIENTS.

DATA REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) AND THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA). THE SECRETARY OF HHS HAS DELEGATED ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA). BRINGING THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTED PATIENTS INTO THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIAN PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE ROLE OF THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD IN OVERSEEING OPIOID ADDICTION TREATMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THE FEDERATION OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS (FSMB) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH CSAT TO DEVELOP MODEL GUIDELINES FOR USE BY STATE MEDICAL BOARDS IN REGULATING THE OFFICE-BASED TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTION. DATA ALSO PERMITS STATE MEDICAL LICENSING BOARDS TO DETERMINE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN QUALIFY A PHYSICIAN AS HAVING THE ABILITY TO TREAT AND MANAGE OPIATE DEPENDENT PATIENTS.
  
THE FSMB MODEL GUIDELINES ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE STATE MEDICAL BOARDS TO ADOPT CONSISTENT STANDARDS, PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH BY AVAILING OPIOID ADDICTED PATIENTS OF APPROPRIATE TREATMENT, AND EDUCATING THE REGULATORY AND PHYSICIAN COMMUNITIES ON NEW TREATMENT MODALITIES OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTION.  

IN THAT REGARD, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY AND ELIZABETH MCCANCE-KATZ ARE THE SOLE SOURCE TO EDUCATE MEDICAL AND OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATA REQUIREMENTS, RELATIONSHIP WITH DATA QUALIFYING GROUPS, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND IN BUPRENORPHINE TRAINING DEVELOPMENT, AND EXPERTISE IN STATE MEDICAL BOARD DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY IN PRESCRIBING BUPRENORPHINE. THEY ARE THE SOLE SOURCE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE TASKS NECESSARY FOR COMPLETION OF THIS CONTRACT, SPECIFICALLY, THE PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICIAN TRAININGS, AND CONTINUAL SUPPORT OF TRAINED PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBING BUPRENORPHINE.  DR. MCCANCE-KATZ IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO SEE THAT THE TRAINING IS INCORPORATED INTO THE MEDICAL FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE.  SHE HAS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW DHHS/SAMHSA TREATMENT IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL TITLED "CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF BUPRENORPHINE IN THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID ADDICTION," BY SERVING ON THE BUPRENORPHINE ADVISORY BOARD. DR. MCCANCE-KATZ CURRENTLY SERVES AS VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY, WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIVE PROFESSIONAL DATA ORGANIZATIONS DESIGNATED BY FEDERAL MANDATES TO TRAIN PHYSICIANS IN EIGHT HOURS OF COURSEWORK IN BUPRENORPHINE. 

THIS SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WILL BE ISSUED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS IN THE INTEREST OF ECONOMY, EFFICIENCY, AND EFFECTIVENESS.  THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS ACQUISITION IS LOGICALLY CONSISTENT WITH WORK THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR HAS UNDERTAKEN INDEPENDENTLY IN THE PAST.  

THIS UNIVERSITY HAS THE TRUST OF THE TREATMENT FIELD IN VIRGINIA AND HAS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED THE CONTACTS AND INFLUENCE, NOT ONLY WITH THE OPIOID AGONIST TREATMENT FIELD, BUT ALSO WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS.  THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALSO WORKED SUCCESSFULLY WITH DEVELOPING MEDICALLY FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS AND PROJECTS IN THE PAST.   

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

The concept and SMAX prototype developed by SAIC is the only existing technology that is mature enough to be demonstrated.  SAIC has applied for patents regarding the critical design features of this antenna.  As the developer, only SAIC has the expertise to provide the required SMAX and has a mature (TRL 6) antenna.  Award to any other source would not meet the technology readiness requirements or allow USSOCOM to meet the criteria to execute a technology demonstration program and/or demonstrate the tactical utility of the SMAX.  If the military utility and lower ownership costs (i.e., no modification to the aircraft) are successfully demonstrated, a possibility exists for a future competitive situation.  It is anticipated that USSOCOM will procure one (1) TRL 6 antenna in order to test its military utility along with an option to integrate and test it with a government furnished radar system.  The contract will be for a period of performance of approximately two to three years with an estimated contract value of up to $5M.  The North American Industry Classification is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  No competitive solicitation will be issued for this effort.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via email to Ms. Valerie Romanchek, (romancv@socom.mil) or faxed to (813) 828-7504.   See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Steven Foster, 732-427-1528
<DESC>ATTN: Reference Note 22.... Solicitation to be issed on or about 25 June 2004.... The focus of the IB-CSAS technology is to prevent fratricide in soldier-to-soldier, soldier-to-ground platforms & centers, platform-to-soldier, soldier-to-aerial platforms and aerial platforms-to-soldiers engagements by enabling friendly forces (dismounted  soldiers, ground vehicles, air vehicles, and stationary emplacements) to locate and identify each other, and determine whether these forces would be harmed or in the potential trajectory path/impact region of a given weapon system for visible and occluded  targeting, to include military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) environments.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s engineering efforts required to assess, develop and demonstrate technology areas that have the potential for furthe r development into an integrated combat identification and situational awareness technology suite, which would be suitable for employment in the Land Warrior (LW) system when the technology reaches (demonstrates) an appropriate level of maturity.   Initially, the Contractor shall analyze the current state (i.e., effectiveness, maturity, scalability, cost) of the IB-CSAS technology areas and suggest a path forward for insertion into the LW spiral development cycle, keeping in mind the LW key performan ce parameters such as size, weight and power.  The ultimate goal is to provide combat identification capabilities or other system performance improvement to LW with minimal developmental risk, and with reduced size, weight and power, all at an affordable p rice.  The ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis shall incorporate the efforts and lessons learned from the FY2003 effort, which was placed as a subcontract under the LW-SI Contract DAAB07-03-C-N001, and recommend to the Government a suitable technology development p ath.  The Contractor shall not duplicate work performed under the FY2003 effort, as this SOW is intended to be a continuation of the FY2003 effort. Following the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s review and approval of the ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis and recommendation, the Contractor will be authorized to develop the IB-CSAS technologies (as selected by the Government) into hardware, software and firmware, integrate these into a LW system and demonstrate this as an integrated LW solution.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command - Picatinny has a requirement for a signature suppression device for the M107 Long Range Sniper  Rifle system.  The key functional characteristics of this device will be to  suppress the visual flash, sound, and muzzle blast (blowback) signature, which  occurs during the firing of the weapon.  The M107 is a variant of the  commercial semi-automatic Barrett M82A1 rifle (variations are inconsequential  for the suppressor), chambered for a .50 cal BMG ammunition with rail mounted  optical sights and an integral backup iron sight.  The M107 has a 29-inch long  barrel with a detachable muzzle brake.  The nominal muzzle velocity is 2,800  feet per second and the maximum effective range of the weapon is 2,000 yards,  with a standard 660-grain bullet.  This device cannot increase recoil, have an  adverse effect on safety, nor degrade the accuracy of the weapon.  It must have  a service life of at least 2,000 rounds.  Other important factors are  reliability, maintenance, weight, length, and cost.  A minimum production  capability of 90 per month is desired, with a surge capacity up to 135 per  month.  Offeror will be required to submit approximately 5 bid samples with  their proposals.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. This provision is attached to this combined synopsis / solicitation.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.

<DESC>Scope of this project:

Provision of 602 tracking system vehicle kits, 5 non-mobile kits for command posts, 17 display screens for operational command centers, initial spare parts, transportation and software.  This system should be based on the use of the Global Positioning System to determine the position of a unit.  This position is then transmitted to a commercial satellite and relayed to a Ground Center. In order to reduce the bandwidth requirements, only that part of the complete picture which is relevant to the individual unit is sent out and displayed on the computer which is part of each unit's tracking system kit.  The complete picture is sent to a central location.  This tracking system should also provide a message exchange service that has the same functionality as a common e-mail system.  Messages are passed via the commercial satellite system to the ground center, which in turn acts like a message exchange service. 

Estimated cost is 3.1 Million Euro.  Due to the urgency a limited competition will be conducted among firms nominated by each NATO nation.  Firms wishing to compete in this procurement must be nominated to the U.S. Mission to NATO by the U.S. Department of Commerce and no later than Close of Business, Monday 14 June 2004.

Etta R. Munford (BIS/OSIES/DPD)is the point of contact for interested U.S. firms regarding certification/eligibility procedures and/or questions.

Bonaparte Lookout (Bldg #4220), constructed in 1961, is located on the Tonasket Ranger District at an elevation of 7258 feet.  The lookout is located approximately 20 road miles northeast of Tonasket, Washington. (2) The Goat Peak Lookout (Bldg #4206), constructed in 1950, is located on the Methow Valley Ranger District at an elevation of 7001 feet.  The lookout is located approximately 20 road miles northwest of Winthrop, Washington. Both lookouts are wood frame structures (14-15 ftƒp square) supported on an open braced wood tower (Mt. Bonaparte Lookout tower is 20 feet high and Goat Peak Lookout tower is 10 feet high).  The Mt. Bonaparte Lookout has a flat roof structure and the Goat Peak Lookout has a hipped roof structure with cedar shakes.  Wood frame stairs provide access and a 36 inch wide catwalk frames the perimeter of each lookout.  Photos of the lookouts can be viewed at:   www.firelookout.com/wa.html.  Select ¡§Browse by Alphabetical List¡¨ and find Bonaparte (Mount) and Goat Peak (Okanogan NF).  The intent of this project is to repair or replace existing materials "in-kind" or with compatible materials to the extent feasible and to maintain the historic character and appearance of the lookout.  The specific work involves: Mt. Bonaparte LO - Replace the existing flat roof with a wood frame pitched hip roof structure including new holddown hardware, reinforce the interior and exterior built-up beams with a new LVL (laminated veneer lumber) joists, reinforce tower girders with corrosion resistant tube steel installed between and bolted to the existing girder members.  Goat Peak LO - Replace cedar shake roof and hip flashing, install collar ties with double 2x4¡¦s, remove and replace tower bracing and struts on sides adjacent to mid-span support.  On both Lookouts - Replace and paint catwalk handrails and posts, remove and replace all exterior window sills, trim, and blocking with similar material, build and install new shutters, replace the existing door, screen door, tile flooring, and interior blinds. Price Range is between $100,000 and $250,000. Due to the extreme remoteness of the sites, pre-bid meeting is not planned. This project is 100% set aside for small business concerns. Estimated start work date is September 7, 2004. This solicitation will be uploaded to www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 08, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   SYNOPSIS THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED.  The solicitation number is PM4053 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of  this solicitation. This solicitation is being procured under full and open competition.   The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing and distributing Teflon filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution  control agencies.  The Teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM-2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national  particulate networks.   EPA obtains the filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  The Teflon filters will be shipped from the manufacturer, to the Agency, in one lot packed in sets of 50 filters per container in suitable clear hard dust-tight  non-contaminating plastic.  The contractor shall then either pick up or arrange for the delivery of the filters from the Agency storage facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The contractor shall test 350 filters from the batch of Teflon filters provided by the manufacturer, where a  batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, specified by the PO for acceptance testing by the physical and chemical test described in the statement of work.  Filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the states.   All 350  filters shall be subjected to visual inspection tests and then a certain quantity shall be subjected to other tests described in the statement of work.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the  filters to the state/local air pollution control agencies as specified by the EPA.  The contractor shall distribute approximately 267,000 filters to the state/local air pollution control agencies as soon as the testing has been completed and the filters are determined to be acceptable to EPA. The  Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered.  For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more  important than cost or price.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Andrés Guzmán Tascón, Jefe División, Acceso Universal a la Sociedad de la Información, Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones, Amunátegui 139, Santiago - CHILE.
Phone:  011-56-2-421-3588; Fax:  011-56-2-421-3020
The Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Rural Connectivity Project in Chile.

The Rural Connectivity Project is designed to address the digital divide in Chile.  The Grantee plans to auction concessions for rural internet access services to private sector operators.  The operators will be required to offer internet access services in rural areas at subscriber rates comparable to those available in urban areas.  The winning bidders would be compensated for the relatively higher cost of providing rural internet access with a one-time, up front subsidy.  Bidders will compete based on the basis of the least subsidy required.  Funds for the subsidy will come from the Chilean government’s Telecommunications Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo de Telecomunicaciones, FDT) and a partial allocation of a loan for rural infrastructure from the World Bank.  With the support of the Netherlands consultants trust fund at the World Bank, the Grantee contracted with consultants to carry out a pre-feasibility study, which developed preliminary estimates of demand, recommended the appropriate technologies, and developed a preliminary business model that estimated that the US$15 million subsidy would make internet connection available for approximately 1,000 rural localities. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to assist the Grantee with the preparation of more precise data needed to conduct an efficient auction for concessions to provide rural internet access.  The Grantee needs more accurate demand data, including the potential demand for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services in order to help bidders more accurately gauge the level of risk.  The other key information needed for the bidding process is more precise capital expenditure and operating cost data in order to more accurately define the conditions of the bidding process, such as the maximum allowable subsidy.

A summary of the specific tasks is as follows:

Task 1:  Conduct demand study (which will include in-field polling)
Task 2:  Develop precise picture of network designs and resulting capital expenditure and
  operating costs
Task 3:  Evaluate the potential of VOIP service as a source of additional revenues and 
  profit for the concession operators
Task 4:  Validate the logic and underlying assumptions of the business 
  model developed in the pre-feasibility study
Task 5:  Prepare a preliminary review of the project’s environmental impacts and
 potential mitigating measures
Task 6:  Organize a workshop to solicit feedback from potential operators, subscribers, 
  equipment suppliers, regulators, international organizations, and consultants
Task 7:  Compute new estimates of the expected subsidy amounts required
Task 8:  Provide advisory support to SUBTEL on the preparation of draft tender 
 documents
Task 9:  Present all findings and recommendations to SUBTEL
Task 10: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $253,402 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00PM, June 14, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Request for Information for a Standardized Database Solution for Converting Microsoft Access Databases 

 
1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a two phased solution to convert, store, manipulate and report data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database, and report data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders to be integrated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Operating Platform located at the data hosting center in St. Louis, Missouri.  The database will support users from multiple departments within TSA. Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on June 4, 2004.  See section 8.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Transportation Security Administration, at the request of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and in support the OIT goals  to design, deploy, maintain and enhance the information technology essential for TSA to protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people; is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a standardized, enterprise database solution. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Conceptual technical architecture alternatives for a solution that will:
 
•	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into a standardized database.
•	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized database.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (including MS Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders. 

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for the Standardized Database Solution. TSA requires the conversion of existing operational Access databases to a stable, readily managed, multi-user environment to best support their day-to-day operations. The end state environment required is the target Oracle platform shared by TSA and DHS.  TSA has immediate needs to access and manage critical data during conversion with no operational downtime, and reach the end state Oracle environment in the quickest and most cost-effective manner.  An intermediate database environment would be acceptable while transitioning to Oracle, provided TSA’s data accessibility is not interrupted and this approach meets the business needs of TSA in a cost-effective manner.






TSA’s Office of Information Technology requires the ability to store, manipulate, and report unclassified yet sensitive data.  These capabilities are required short term to quickly support users from multiple departments within TSA using a standard data dictionary.

•	The Standardized Database Solution will eliminate redundant efforts (i.e., less employee time spent developing across the enterprise).
•	The Standardized Database Solution will be hosted in a central location, such as TSA’s hosting center that allows for 24 x 7 support and fault tolerance, depending upon the build, with a dedicated Database Administrator (DBA) to ease management and trouble-shooting of all applications.

TSA’s long term requirements involve the ability to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.  This solution will:

&#61599;	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (Including Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders.

Other requirements not directly related to database architecture will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, service level agreements, and other important considerations.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.


4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

The Standardized Database Solution will meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

The following parameters should be considered when developing a solution to TSA’s database conversion and management requirements:
&#61599;	Grouping TSA conversions in order to fully utilize economy of scale.
&#61599;	Eliminating database redundancies in TSA offices to minimize the number of conversions and subsequent data maintenance activities.
&#61599;	A transitional approach, initially converting TSA databases quickly to a less complex but stable multiple user’s environment to satisfy immediate customer needs.
&#61599;	Single server for all TSA conversions to consolidate and organize these databases for more orderly follow-on conversions or add-ons.
&#61599;	A two-phase solution:  
&#61599;	Phase 1- converting unclassified yet sensitive data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database at a TSA specified data hosting facility.
&#61599;	Phase 2  - creating a long-term solution to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.


5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 – Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for the Standardized Database Solution, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the solution to be hosted by a third party. (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram of the hosting site  identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed).

Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  The costs will include required hardware and software purchases, design and development costs, as well as maintenance and operational support needs. Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)








Section 4 – Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (There is no suggested page count)

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  

Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.


Section 5 – Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

The contract will involve the preparation of various civil works planning and design documents, environmental documents, studies, and specifications for various civil works projects, and secondarily, may also be utilized to support  planning and design at military installations. Up to three indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with a total contract period not to exceed three years.  The contracts may consist of a base period not to exceed one year, with a maximum of two one-year option periods.  Alternatively, the contracts may consist of one three-year contract period.  The total amount of work will not exceed $3,000,000 per contract.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The c ontracts may include task orders with options for planning, engineering and design, checking of shop drawings and design during construction.  Award of the first contract is anticipated in fourth quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2004 or first quarter of FY 2005 .  The method used to allocate task orders among contracts will include consideration of experience and user needs, capacity to accomplish the order in the required timeframe, performance and quality of deliverables, and proximity of the firm to the projec t.  Funds are not presently available for the contracts.   This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for these contracts, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for the Kansas City District are:  (1) at least 57.2% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), including small disadvantaged businesses (SDB) and women-owned small businesses (WOSB); (2) a t least 10% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with SDB; (3) at least 10% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with WOSB; and (4) 3% placed with HUBZone small businesses, and 3% placed with service Disabled Veteran O wned Small Businesses. The plan is not required with this submittal.  The small business standard for this effort is based on the average annual receipts of the concern and its affiliates for the preceding three (3) fiscal years.  A business is small for t his effort if its average annual receipts do not exceed $4 million.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contra ct Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work).

<DESC>Point of Use Consignment Concept Study Request for Information This request for information is in accordance with FAR Chapter 15, Subpart 15.201.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, market information, and capabilities for planning purposes.  To satisfy all requirements pertaining to and governed by regulations and policies, it is in the best interest of the Government to prevent and eliminate future problems.  It is also requested that a market research be conducted, finalized, and all conclusions documented prior to further advancements of this study.  The Government believes information provided from industry sources is important and is receptive to all information provided.  The due date for the information is June 25, 2004.  Please submit your information to Sophia Hurt by email at Sophia.hurt@mail.va.gov. Purpose: To determine if direct delivery of medical products to a Point of Use (vending machine) by a medical supply distributor is feasible using the consignment arrangement.  The distributor provides the Point of Use equipment (POU) at no charge and stocks it on a consignment basis, charging VA only for the products that are used.   Objective:  1. Confirm that vendor replenishment consignment method reduces supply consumption. 2. Determine if equipment can accommodate necessary supplies in designated areas. 3. Test contractor performance for complete replenishment without medical center involvement. 4. During the study the distributor must meet and maintain storage and distribution standards in accordance with VA Directive/Handbook 7176.  All substitutes must be approved prior to being stocked in any designated area.  This test will be conducted for approximately 1 year to determine if fees paid for this service is cost effective.  Goal: The Point of Use Consignment Concept Study will determine whether Point of use provide operational improvements, savings, reduction, and consumption in supply usage and the overall efficiency for Medical Center Supply Management.  This study will also determine if POU systems currently located at a separate facility managed by in-house VA personnel using the traditional replenishment method has an impact on the performance of the medical center clinical staff, and medical supply technicians.  The test will conclude if in fact the medical facilities can apply the same distributor concept establish a method to reduce consumption, cost and be effective and prove the overall capability of the POU system is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health.  The Preclinical Research Contracts Branch (PRCB) of the Contract Management Program (CMP) of the Division of Extramural Activities (DEA), NIAID is seeking capability statements from small business organizations with the technical expertise and facilities to support DAIT’s ultimate goal of developing “user-friendly” mathematical modeling tools for high (whole organism or system), intermediate (tissue or organ), or fine (single cell) resolution modeling of host-immune responses to infection and vaccines/therapeutics against NIAID Category A, B and C priority pathogens.   (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  As part of its research program to improve defense against potential agents of bioterrorism, DAIT seeks to establish Immune Modeling Centers (Centers).  These multi-disciplinary Centers will develop novel, or improved, highly predictive mathematical models to define host immune responses to infection, as well as vaccination and other therapeutic interventions used to protect against NIAID Category A, B and C priority pathogens.  In some cases, immunological mechanisms relevant to biodefense are broadly applicable for many pathogens and may be most efficiently studied using model systems.  Inclusion of immunological research that is not directed specifically at NIAID Category A, B and C priority pathogens, or their products, may be found to be responsive if it directly addresses a practical approach to developing mathematical models to define host immune responses to infection, as well as vaccination and other therapeutic interventions against NIAID Category A, B, or C pathogens.  This correlation should be described very clearly in the capability statement.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance DAIT’s understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity and guide laboratory experiments of host immune responses against infectious agents.  Results obtained from these programs will sharpen DAIT’s assessments of vaccine efficacy and responses to other prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, and will advance development of novel or improved vaccines, prophylactics, and immunotherapeutics against NIAID Category A, B and C priority pathogens.   

Under this program, the Centers shall conduct basic and applied research to develop new mathematical models or improve existing models of immune responses to NIAID Category A, B and C priority pathogens or vaccines and immune-based therapies against these pathogens.  The models shall be validated through appropriate immunological experimentation.  The multi-disciplinary research team shall consist of immunologists, physicists or engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and infectious disease experts.  Centers may be “virtual;” however, frequent interactions and communication are key elements to the program’s success.  Each Center shall focus on a specific immunological area, such as various aspects of innate or adaptive immunity, or the interface between innate and adaptive immune responses that are critical for protection against pathogens.  Each Center will have strong bioinformatics and education components:  (i) the bioinformatics component will develop methods and standards for data sharing and communication among the Centers, using open-source protocols, and shall also facilitate the development and distribution of “user-friendly” immune modeling tools to the broader research community; and (ii) the Center-localized education component shall be directed at graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and visiting scientists within the Centers that provide trainees with an understanding of the power of applying mathematical principles to biological phenomena in immunology; drawing from other fields to develop the education programs, such as population genetics, ecology, and epidemiology is encouraged.

In the field of immunology, researchers have used mathematical models to advance the understanding of the dynamics of adaptive immunity, such as antibody generation and specificity, development of CD4+ T cell responses that include parameters for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, generation and maintenance of immunological memory, and predictions of host-pathogen interactions.  This effort will support research to improve the predictive qualities of immune-focused mathematical models, which may be used to:  extract knowledge from complex data sets and to suggest new experiments; predict vaccine efficacy and responses to other prophylactic and therapeutic treatments; and facilitate the development of novel or improved vaccines, prophylactics, and therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism by translating in vitro and in vivo animal study data into predictions of human immune responses.  This program will benefit from current expertise and recent advances in immunology, infectious disease, mathematics, and computational biology.

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  Interested Small Business organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas cited above.  No submission shall exceed a maximum of 25 1-sided pages in a 12-point font.  No collect calls will be accepted and no facsimile transmissions will be accepted. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR FEWER.  See contact information above.

<DESC>Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Teaming Opportunity for the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development NASA Research Announcement (NNH40Zss001N)  Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (NNH04Zss001N-PID) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, “Planetary Instrument Definition and Development” (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/nnh04zss001n/appendB_11.html). The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD) program supports the advancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that shows promise for use in scientific investigations on future planetary missions.  The goal of the program is not to develop flight-qualified hardware but rather to define and develop scientific instruments or components of such instruments to the point where the instruments may be proposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity without additional extensive technology development.   This NRA solicits proposals for instrument definition and breadboard development for the following future types of missions: 1. Discovery Program  (For additional information see http://discovery.nasa.gov/) 2. Mars Exploration Program (For additional information http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/) 3. New Frontiers (For additional information see http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/newfrontiers/) The emphasis in this NRA is also on the development of miniaturized, low power, low cost instruments for Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other similar missions.   Instrument definition and development studies can take place at several stages, including feasibility studies, conceptual design, and laboratory breadboarding (but not brassboarding) of critical components and complete instruments.  Proposed instruments must address significant scientific questions relevant to stated NASA goals.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the PIDD Program to develop proposals and execute development and performance demonstrations of components and subsystems.  Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in component and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide components and subsystems consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  Your responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469 Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: David O. Garner, Contracting Officer 757-864-2784 david.o.garner@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is 4:00 p.m. local time June 18, 2004.  The following LaRC technology proposal is seeking partnerships. The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions are provided below:   Robotic Integrated Management System (RIMS) Technical Point of Contact:	Gene S. Monroe Jr., Gene.S.Monroe@NASA.gov  Phone:	(757) 864-6156 NASA Langley is actively developing concepts for a flexible and reconfigurable computing system that is capable of performing self-health monitoring and repair while performing routine tasks on a land rover.	RIMS is capable of performing self-diagnostics, and then executing self-repair.	RIMS’s functionality includes motor controllers to perform various autonomous functions such as drilling into planetary surfaces, as well as multi-sensor feedback from distributed I/O.  The ability of the system to be reconfigured under software control makes it such that hardware modifications are not necessary to satisfy various applications.  NASA Langley is currently involved in: defining potential science missions; developing autonomous control operations; studying the dynamics of RIMS through the development of computer simulation models; and verifying simulation model assumptions through land rover mounted instruments. NASA Langley Research Center is currently seeking partners to collaborate in the NASA Research Announcement, Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD).	The capabilities desired by partners include, but is not limited to: (1)	Deep Drilling, with water sensing technologies. (2)	Collaborative robotics algorithms for coordinating science measurements. (3)	Geostationary navigation and mapping capabilities.

<SUBJECT>15 -- WAIVER OF NONMANUFACTURER RULE
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) INTENDS TO TERMINATE the waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft.  SBA’s intent to terminate the waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule is based on our recent discovery of a small business manufacturer for these classes of products.  Terminating these waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small businesses or 8(a) Business Development Program provide the products of small business manufacturers or processor on such contracts. 
DATE:  Comments and sources must be submitted on or before July 2, 2004.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act) , 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  
The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of product, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.  The SBA defines "class of products" based on the six digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the four digit Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.
     The SBA received a request on January 12, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft.  In response, on February 4, 2004, SBA published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to grant the waiver of the Nonmanufactuer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft.  On March 15, 2004, SBA issued a notice of waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft.   In responses to these notices, no comments were received from any interested party.  However, we recently discovered that the class of products was incorrectly classified as NAICS 441229.  The correct NAICS code for Aircraft Manufacturing is NAICS 336411.  This notice proposes to terminate the class waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for General Aviation Turboprop Aircraft, NAICS 441229.
  The public is invited to comment to SBA on the proposed termination of the waivers of the nonmanufacturer rule for the class of products specified. All comments by the public will be duly considered by SBA in determining whether to finalize its intent to terminate these classes of products. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

Past Performance Factor: The quoter shall submit, as part of its quotation, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

All quotations shall include price(s), FOB Destination, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, delivery and  installation schedule, and payment terms.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<SUBJECT>D -- Web-based integrated library system
<SOLNBR>FA7012-04-T-0073
<RESPDATE>063004
<ARCHDATE>07152004
<CONTACT>Ryan Goodwin, Contract Negotiator, Phone (202) 767-7956, Fax (202) 767-7887, Email ryan.goodwin@bolling.af.mil
<DESC>Attached hereto are the responses to the questions asked pertaining to the Web-based Integrated Library System Requirement at Bolling AFB, DC. 

(1) What percentage of the contract time does the government anticipate will be spent on base? Is it acceptable for the contractor to work in their facilities except for meetings with government and training? Things would likely lower the price required to build the system given the synergy of working in a currently setup facility. We have done this on other government projects without issue. Answer:Initial set-up training. Monthly meetings for the first 6 months then teleconference call meetings unless problems arise that need on site attendance.

(2)Does the government assume that offers will already have a web based library system available which will be tailored to governments specifications or does the solicitation intend to cover the hours necessary to build the system based on further defined requirements through working with the government and performing industry research? Answer: YES.  The offeror shall already have a web-based library system available tailoring to the Government’s needs.  If future changes occur, they will be added via modification.

(3) Does the government have any expectation of when funding will become available for this project? If in fact it does become available? Answer: We don’t know the exact funding allocation date yet.

(4) Is it expected that the system will reside in the contractor’s facility for the duration of the project? Is it acceptable to propose a third party datacenter if this allows the contractor to propose a more robust and secure solution for the government? Note that this would involve having employees of the third party datacenter with physical access to the machine. Answer: As long as the data center is a registered affiliate of the contractor with all the necessary security assurance, and the contractor will vouch for them.

(5) Is this to be a firm fixed price or time and materials contract? Answer: Please give a break down both ways; I.E. fixed price or time and materials.  

(6) Will a database maintenance plan in which a full backup is performed every night, a transaction log backup is performed every hour, and the most recent two weeks’ of backups are maintained offsite be sufficient for your need? Will a monthly backup of the application files be sufficient? Answer:  See RFQ, paragraph 5, BACK-UPS and 6, SYSTEMS. 

(7) Is training restricted to existing library staff or should we expect to provide training to additional staff of and when they are hired? Answer: A full training  schedule co-ordinated with the library director and IT specialist is required for all current staff. 

(8) Item # 14 (Modules) mentions OPAC (online public access) and web based access. Is there a difference between OPAC and web based access that we need to be aware of? Does the web based access refer to the administrative functions of the system (i.e. cataloging, circulation, patron, authority) while OPAC refers to the publicly accessible part of the system? Answer: As a library automation systems provider you should know the difference between these two terms.

(9) Are you expecting a timeline for the project (e.g. 3 months development followed by implementation and ongoing support) included in the RFQ? Answer: We would hope that the first step for set-up, initial patron records and bib records migration can be accomplished promptly. Then in house training should be the next step with online tutorials as back-up for practice areas. This will have to be an almost live turn over so we will need to co-ordinate with the legacy system , Dynix to plan the accessibility and availability of the data needed to start the programs. 

(10) Are you expecting to only allow certain library staff to administer each module of the ILS? Or will all library staff have access to all of the data (i.e. bibliographic, patron, circulation, authority)? Answer: Different staff have different library duties and so we will need to discuss to whom which duties fall. All staff need to have access to the CIRC records, and OPAC. The OPAC is also open to all library patrons ands users.

(11) What barcode scanning hardware /software are you currently using in the library? Is this a part of the Dynix Suite? Answer: 
CIRC has 2 stand scanners connected to the CIRC desk PCs. We also have on wand bar code scanner attached to the PC/ printer for the catalog module. We get our bar codes from DYNIX.

(12) From reading the solicitation , it looks like  you want the system vendor to host the database and let the library access the information remotely (#20). At the same time, you ask for hardware specs, wiring specs, etc in number 3 (Delivery, installation and checkout) and discuss equipment redundancy in #7. Am I correct in the assumption that you want a hosted solution? Would we provide specs for workstations in this section? Answer: Yes we want ahosted solution- an ASP system that will configure with our current hardware set-up of two PCs on the CIRC desk. And two PCs for public access to the OPAC- we may expand the public access to the other computers but only for viewing the OPAC.

(13) Could you provide your definition of ‘web-based-library-solution’? Answer: Intergrated Library System that is hosted via the internet; I.E. Through an Internet portal connection the vendor has the hardware to capture/save; manages/ stores and services the library management system.  

(14) If our understanding is correct that this is set aside for a small business, does that mean we have to submit a bid with SBE subcontractors, or the fact that we are an SBE already fulfills the requirement? Answer: This is a question for the contracting agent Ms Gaines

(15) Is there a more detailed RFP for the requirement? How do we get a copy of this? Answer: The current RFQ is being amended and will be released before the end of this week- therefore the closing date has been extended.

(16) Can we purpose an RFID based system for this requirement? Or is there a particular technology (barcode) preference? Answer: You will have to explain what you mean by an RFID I have never heard of this method used in the library management field. The barcode scanner/ system must be compatible with our current barcode program as they are on all the BIB records, 52,000 items.

(17) Are there special security considerations (infrastructure-system and construction) that must be architected or is the library for public access? Answer: We are a public access library but all patron records need to be secure. The vendor will need to provide a secure connection and server datacenter.

(18) What type of backup rotation scheme will be needed? How far back would the library need to restore in case of problems? Answer: We have to retrieve the patron data and all bib records form the old Dynix system  With the old Dynix Unix data the CIRC records are not a priority.

(19) How is performance measured? Answer: By meeting all agreed upon requirements in a timely and professional manner. To always be prompt in responding to any technical questions that arise during initial set-up and then the length on the contract. To provide an explanation of any issues and how the issues was resolved for future reference. All reports to be submitted in a timely fashion

(20) What kind of security is required? Data encryption?- point to point security (VPN, HTTP)? Answer: This depends on what kind of security system you offer and what kind of secure internet connection you will provide the library automation system. 

(21) What kind of uptime assurance is required? 99% ? Answer: The system needs to be available at a minimum during library hours of operation. Monday-Saturday 8am –8pm

(22) What type or capabilities are required from the library system? Answer: Do not understand this question.  Please Clarify.

(23) Does the library currently use any scanning system for checking in and out books? Answer: Yes two barcode scanners

(24) How many total desktops and printers will be required access to the system? Answer: CIRC=2, OPAC= 2, Library Administration=2, Catalog=2, and 2 printers. 

(25) What types of reports are required from the system? Answer: 
Biannual CIRC reports, biannual inventory, ILL history; and patron record history.

(26) Can we have a sample of the data that will need to be imported to the system? Answer: This is not yet possible would need to be a special request to be put in to DYNIX .

(27)  Can we have a sample of the data that is sent to you on CD about books and other media you bring to your library? Answer: 
As was explained on the Friday morning walk through the records are in MARC format and we can request they be in ACSE text to be imported in to the system. This should be feasible for a new ASP system provider.

(28) Since you lease books and media- do you require being able to import a list of items that need to be sent out so they are marked as no longer in stock? Answer: When the leased items records are imported into the OPAC they are tagged as such and then we would alter their status if they get kept or removed.
