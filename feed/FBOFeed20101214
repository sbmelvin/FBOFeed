<SUBJECT>19--Collaboration Center Support for Ship and Mission Systems Design Activities
<SOLNBR>N0002405C5346P001XX
<RESPDATE>122910
<ARCHDATE>12302010
<CONTACT>Mr. Brendan OMara 202-781-3512
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a contract modification to Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon IDS) of Tewksbury, MA for Collaboration Center support for up to one hundred and fifteen (115) Program Executive Office, Ships (PEO Ships) and contractor personnel at the 1100 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, D.C. Collaboration Center for the purpose of conducting engineering and program management functions to support ship and mission systems design activities without providing for full and open competition.  

Raytheon IDS will be responsible for providing collaboration facilities, equipment, and support services necessary to accommodate PEO Ships and contractor personnel beginning in January 2011 and continuing through 31 December 2011, as required.
  Raytheon IDS will be responsible for providing access to both classified and unclassified Integrated Data Environment (IDE) network(s), an approved Special Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), as well as connectivity to the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), as part of this Collaboration Center requirement.  

Raytheon IDS is the sole company capable of providing these facilities, equipment, and support services for PEO Ships and contractor personnel without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  Raytheon IDS has proven experience in providing collaboration support services in support of PEO Ships at this same 1100 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, D.C.
 Collaboration Center since January 2006.  This facility has been approved for Government collaboration purposes based on detailed reviews of security requirements, networking capabilities, and all other appropriate requirements for facilities and support staffing.  The facilities support the requirement for collaboration of PEO Ships shipbuilding programs to interact with their prime contractors, warfare centers, and other Government and industry agencies, and with one another, to monitor shipbuilding progress, resolve problems, and share lessons learned to improve shipbuilding practices and efficiency.  The Raytheon IDS Collaboration Center is the only existing facility within walking distance of the Washington Navy Yard already configured for collaboration, with the necessary information technology systems, and an approved SCIF.
  In order to accommodate the personnel required to collaborate to execute the Navys shipbuilding programs, PEO Ships requires space for up to 115 PEO Ships and contractor personnel for collaboration activities at the 1100 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, D.C. Collaboration Center.  An unacceptable schedule delay of approximately one (1) year is expected if this contract modification is not awarded to Raytheon IDS.  This estimated delay is based on the effort expended by Raytheon IDS to establish the 1100 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, D.C. Collaboration Center.  

For the reasons stated above, and pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract modification for PEO Ships Collaboration Center support to Raytheon IDS, 50 Apple Hill Drive, Tewksbury, MA 01876.
  Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly.  

Note - The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This situational awareness system requires an upgrade to the current suite of visual sensors to increase visibility of the surrounding environment.<BR><BR>The parameters of the desired visual sensor cameras are as follows:  <BR><BR>The visual sensors must contain both a daytime color and infrared visualization capability.  It is assumed that each sensor includes two cameras: one for color daytime capability and one for infrared capability.  If a single camera can accomplish both capabilities simultaneously, references to separate cameras can be assumed to apply to the single camera.  Both cameras must have a horizontal Field of View (FOV) no less than 40 degrees; and, a vertical FOV no less than 30 degrees. The daytime color camera must detect an upright, stationary adult in fair weather no less than 180 meters away; and, the infrared camera must do the same no less than 250 meters away.  The sensor must reside upon a mechanical pan-tilt system with a pan range of no less than 360 degrees (continuous) and tilt range of at least +90 / -30 degrees elevation.  The daytime color camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 768V x 494H; whereas, the infrared camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 640V x 480H.  The sensor unit must provide a serial control interface via RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 half duplex; and, the pan-tilt unit must provide a control bus interface via RS-485 half duplex.  The sensor and pan-tilt unit must have Built-In Test (BIT) capability for fault detection/isolation. The latency from either camera must not exceed 35 milliseconds from point of image capture to distribution on a video or data network.  The sensor unit must be ruggedized to military standards.<BR><BR>Respondents should be companies that have proven capabilities as a vehicle system integrator and can ruggedize sensor technologies to military standards.

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for all parameters.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Region's Environmental Office MP-157.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratory's QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The MP-157 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support MP-157 Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratory's QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratory's ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratory's expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices. Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Environmental Monitoring Branch (MP-157).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-157's policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratory's QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval LetterThe laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA section's audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratory's audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a

<DESC>The Forest Service is looking for qualified vendors to preform the following service.&nbsp; This is only a sources sought.&nbsp; If you are qualified please email similar projects and contact names.<br /><br />The intent and purpose of this contract is to obtain professional services to develop a historic context and an evaluation of the National Register eligibility of ranger boats presently operated by the US Forest Service in Alaska. These include the Sitka Ranger, located in Sitka, Alaska and the Tongass Ranger, located in Ketchikan, Alaska. The Chugach Ranger, located in Petersburg, Alaska was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 and is to be included only in the historic context section of the report resulting from this contract. <br /><br />The Contractor will follow guidelines in Archeology and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (48 FR 44716, 1983, as amended) for work performed under this contract, particularly those sections relating to "Developing Historic Contexts," and "Application of the Criteria within a Historic Context." The Contractor will also find the following guidelines very useful: National Register Bulletin 20, "Nominating Historic Vessels and Shipwrecks to the National Register of Historic Places," published by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, in 1992; and National Register Bulletin 16B, "How to Complete the National Register Multiple Property Documentation Form," published by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1991.<br /><br />The Contractor will develop the historic context and documentation. The historical analysis will identify the theme, time period, and geographic limits for the historic context. It will summarize and synthesize existing information on the history of ranger boat use by the Forest Service in Alaska. It will identify and provide a summary discussion of the variety and types of vessels used by the Forest Service in Alaska, with particular attention to the existing ranger boats in use (or presently in storage) today, and which may be of historic significance. The historic context will provide sufficient documentation to serve as the basis for the Statement of Significance for any National Register of Historic Places evaluations and/or nominations dealing with ranger boats.

<p><strong>Statement of Work</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background <br /></span>Since its inception, the Laboratory of Structural Biology Research (LSBR) has specialized in detailed structural analysis of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and subcellular structures by computer-enhanced electron microscopy. The goal of these studies is to elucidate structure-function relationships at the molecular level with particular emphasis on (but not restricted to) systems that bear directly on the mission of NIAMS. This program was initiated in 1978 with the appointment of a tenure-track investigator (the Project Officer), and progressed to become a Section in 1984, and further to Laboratory status in 1990. A typical research project involves recording electron micrographs of the highest possible quality, subjecting them to digital image analysis to elicit the maximum amount of structural information, and interpretation, taking into account all pertinent complementary data. Over the years, the LSBR has performed ground-breaking studies on cytoskeletal filaments, virus particles and antigens, and complex enzymes among other important biomedical specimens. Cryo-electron microscopy - the technique of visualizing organic specimens suspended in vitreous ice - was introduced in the 1980s and has revolutionized what is achievable. The LSBR has been to the fore in these advances and in 1997 accomplished the landmark result of extending the resolution on isolated complexes below the 10&Aring; limit for the first time. The results achieved depend both on the quality of the primary data (electron microscope images) and the scope of computer analysis. As for the former, keeping our electron microscopes operational and maintaining them in peak performing condition are essential to our work.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives<br /></span>Specifically, in order to keep the LSBR's electron microscopes operational and maintain them in peak performing condition, a maintenance contract that covers repair and routine maintenance is required.</p>
<p>A qualified supplier is needed to maintain these advanced and intricate instruments to the standards of operation essential for sustaining the performance of our electron microscopy experiments at the state-of-the-art.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is a Request For Information (RFI); a market research mechanism used by the Government to gauge the marketplace and learn the industry's capabilities. <br />The information requested hereunder is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or contract awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. Responses to the notice will not be returned. The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations. <br />Program Introduction:<br />Initiated in 2000, with the passage of the Coral Reef Conservation Act, NOAA's CRCP supports effective management and sound science to preserve, sustain and restore valuable coral reef ecosystems. The CRCP headquarters operations are located in Silver Spring, MD, with significant field staff in the Pacific and Caribbean regions.
<p>The CRCP is a partnership among NOAA, the seven US coral reef jurisdictions, and numerous other federal agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs. The CRCP brings together expertise from NOAA's Line Offices for a multidisciplinary approach to managing and understanding coral reef ecosystems. These offices carry out, directly and in partnership, a wide range of activities, including mapping and monitoring of coral reefs, research on various aspects of coral reef science and resource management. The CRCP facilitates and supports partnerships with scientific, private, government and nongovernmental groups at local, state, federal and international levels. <br />The CRCP also plays a key role in the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF), an inter-agency task force, authorized under Executive Order 13089. The Department of Commerce (represented by NOAA) and the Department of Interior co-chair the USCRTF. The CRCP provides staff support to the USCRTF. The USCRTF is composed of twelve Federal agencies, the seven states and territories that contain coral reefs, and the three Freely Associated States. A key partner in this effort will be the All Islands Committee of the US Coral Reef Task Force (AIC). The AIC is comprised of the Governor appointed points of contact (POC) to the USCRTF. <br />An external program review of the CRCP was completed in September of 2007. The review panel provided a series of recommendations for the CRCP. Among these recommendations was a call for the program to better meet the needs of coral reef managers in the jurisdictions and the completion of capacity assessments to better understand those needs. The CRCP subsequently developed, via extensive NOAA and external input, a "Roadmap for the Future" to lay out proposed changes to the Program. The Roadmap sets the primary objective of the CRCP as addressing strategic management needs. To address this objective, the CRCP recently funded a process to articulate a set of strategic coral reef management priorities per jurisdiction to effectively complement place-based coral reef management efforts by Federal, state, territorial, and local management communities. As a result, each of the seven coral reef jurisdictions now has a set of agreed upon strategic coral reef management priorities. The Roadmap further calls for the CRCP to work with managers to assess the capacity to implement the identified priorities. <br />Overview of Potential Requirement:<br />The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking information/capability statements from interested parties to support the Coral Reef Conservation Program's (CRCP) capability (services and products) to assess the capacity of state and territorial coral programs to achieve their stated priorities for coral reef management. <br />A prospective Contractor shall provide expertise in capacity assessment methodologies as well as have demonstrated understanding of, and experience in, the technical components of multi-disciplinary coral reef conservation programs (e.g. marine protected area management, fisheries management, coastal zone management, etc.). The prospective Contractor will (1) work closely with the CRCP and our local partners to review and provide recommendations on improvements to a draft methodology for conducting the capacity assessments (see attached draft methodology), (2) use the revised methods to develop a jurisdiction specific work plan for implementing the capacity assessment, (3) travel to the jurisdiction to conduct the capacity assessment, and (4) provide a report on capacity assessment in the jurisdiction and recommendations for building capacity. Steps two through four will be completed in sequence for each of the seven coral reef jurisdictions after which the contractor will (5) develop a synthesis report recommending programmatic actions for the CRCP to consider in working with partners to develop capacity for local coral reef conservation. <br />See attached draft methodology for additional information. <br />How to Respond:<br />Responses should include a capability statement outlining parties' qualifications and past experience conducting capacity assessments. The statement should also contain company name, address, point(s) of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. Responses are to be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word (not to exceed 25 pages; including appendices, diagrams, and examples using 12 point Time New Roman font). Submit responses electronically (using PDF or Microsoft Word) no later than 3:00 pm eastern, December 13, 2010 at the following address: robert.mcnamara@noaa.gov</p>

<RESPDATE>122910
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-01-343-3776<br />Name: Wet Mop Wringer and Bucket Set, Yellow<br />Description: Yellow, 26-to-35-quart plastic mopping bucket features wide-stance casters and a metal bail. A plastic sideward press wringer accommodates 12-to-32-ounce mop heads and has a metal handle. Wringer is removable from the bucket.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-01-343-3776<br />Similar Items: RUB 7580-88 YELLOW, 640-7580-88, INC605152, 6Y-2635-3Y-90-605152, 78992088, RUB758088YW, 36904-04</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December xx, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<CONTACT>Joe Milburn, Stewardship Contracting Officer, Phone 970-385-1316, Fax 970-385-1243, Email jmilburn@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Description: <br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
<p>This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a long term stewardship contract that will provide services needed by the Government at the lowest possible cost. The Government will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. The Government is not looking to provide grants or financial assistance as a result of this request. Responses to this request will be confidential if so requested by respondent.</p>
<p><br />Project Name: <br />Mountain Pine Beetle Area Long Term Stewardship Project</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: <br />The Rocky Mountain Region (R2) of the Forest Service is considering offering one or more large multi-year forest restoration project(s) in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle within Northern Colorado and Southern Wyoming. The project(s) would be offered under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act. The overall objective of the project(s) is to reduce hazardous fuels that increase wildland fire risk to communities and infrastructure and promote restoration of the landscape by removing dead and dying trees, and hazard trees that pose a threat to the public and fire fighter safety. Use of stewardship authorities will allow the Forest Service to exchange the value of products removed during the land restoration activities for the cost of the treatments. The area needing treatment is large and available Forest Service funding is relatively low, so a solution that minimizes or eliminates costs to the Government is preferred.</p>
<p>Priority areas needing treatment include:</p>
<p>1. Hazardous fuels that increase wildland fire risk in the wildland urban interface.<br />2. Developed recreation areas, and along road, trail, and power line corridors where hazard trees threaten<br />public safety<br />3. Watersheds that may be at highest risk from damage by severe wildfires or windthrow</p>
<p>Recent assessments indicate that between 5.1 and 6.7 million dry tons of dead or dying trees on approximately 197,000 acres are in need of removal from areas infected by the mountain pine beetle in Colorado and Wyoming. Removal from these areas can be accomplished with conventional ground based harvest systems. Available material may be in the form of dead or beetle infested sawlogs, small roundwood, and limbs, tops, and brush. Some temporary road construction and minor amounts of specified road construction or reconstruction may be required for removal. Areas proposed for treatment would be located primarily on the Medicine Bow, Routt, and White River National Forests, although other Forests may also be included .</p>
<p>The purpose of this request is to solicit information from industry, local communities and others to help determine if offering one or more, long term stewardship contract(s) up to 10 years in length in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle would facilitate the utilization of products removed from treatment areas and/or lower treatment costs. And, if so, how the project should be designed to accomplish those objectives and best meet the needs of the Forest Service, industry, and local communities.</p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service will not release any information received in response to this request marked as "confidential" to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USDA Forest Service without written permission.</p>
<p><br />INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>1. How will offering one or more large scale, long term stewardship contract(s) for the removal of<br />hazardous fuels and hazard trees in areas affected by the mountain pine beetle in Colorado and Wyoming<br />promote utilization or help to reduce treatment costs? <br />2. Does your company have a business model that could be implemented within the area that would accomplish<br />the treatment objectives for the Forest Service? If so, what would the business model look like and <br />what is your estimate of the cost to the Government for treatments under your business model? Does <br />this business model depend on government grants or other financing?<br />3. Would your company utilize biomass or other products removed from treatment areas? If so, how? Would<br />biomass or other products be utilized in existing facilities or would new facilities be constructed <br />for that purpose? Where would facilities be located?<br />4. What is the minimum and maximum amount of material (specify wet or dry tons) that could be treated each <br />year? Where could treatment areas be located? What is your total anticipated 10 year supply need?<br />5. Is there a maximum distance (working circle) treatment areas could be located from facilities or other<br />limitations on what areas could be treated? Does your model require specialized equipment (i.e. chip <br />vans) to be feasible?<br />6. What recommendations do you have for project design and implementation that could help reduce treatment<br />costs?<br />7. Would you prefer that your company contract directly with the Government, or would you prefer to<br />contract with another logging or fuels reduction contractor who maintains the contract with the <br />Government?<br />8. Is there other information you can provide that should be considered in developing a project that will<br />be successful in meeting the needs of industry, the Forest Service, and local communities? What<br />additional raw material requirements or specifications need to be considered.</p>
<p>Please feel free to provide us with any other information, comments, or ideas that may be useful in developing a successful project.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. No formal solicitation or contract has been developed. The exact location of treatment areas and the number of acres to be treated have not been identified. The exact amount of wood or biomass to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.</p>
<p>Submission Requirements:</p>
<p>So that we may better determine capabilities and requirements for this prospective project, we request that you submit your answers to the questions above and any additional comments or concerns you may have by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on Monday, January 17, 2011 with "Mountain Pine Beetle Area Long Term Stewardship Project" in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. The preferred method of communication is by email. Due to volume of contacts, phone calls may not be returned. Please send your responses to Bob Garcia, R2 Stewardship Contracting Coordinator, bgarcia@fs.fed.us and Joe Milburn, Contracting Officer at jmilburn@fs.fed.us.</p>

  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

1.3 Responses to this notice will be used for market research by NAWCWD to determine industry capabilities and thus help verify the Government's requirements for future solicitations.  Information from this research could be used to establish promising areas of technology development and investment under the NAWCWD Future Naval Capability (FNC) High Speed Components Program.

1.0	Background

2.1 The High Speed Components (HSC) Future Naval Capability (FNC) Program was conceived in 2007 to advance the state of the art for high speed missile flight, while providing near term benefits to existing programs of record.
  The HSC program has focused on the competitive development of a robust and inexpensive radome. 

2.2 An improvement over current radome electrical and structural performance characteristics is desired for new high-speed missile systems.   This High Speed Components Program addresses the need for a radome having low susceptibility to thermal gradients, improved performance at higher temperatures and aerodynamic loads, increased handling toughness for high tempo shipboard operations, and acceptable electrical properties for accommodating dual mode tracking systems.  

2.3   This RFI specifically addresses the ability to incorporate a FSS into the radome design with development efforts focusing on improving manufacturing and production techniques.
  The final product will have superior performance characteristics and be produced at a cost savings compared to current radomes requiring this capability.

2.0	 Requested Information

3.1 Responses to the RFI will describe a concept(s) that is currently being or would be pursued; the FSS design approach, and methodologies for applying FSS to a ceramic matrix radome with a base diameter slightly larger than 8 inches, a fineness ratio of 1.5 to 1.8, operating temperatures ranging from 900oF (several minutes) to 1770oF (several seconds), and a Von Karman ogive forward nose shape.  Any risks associated with the technology and its application, particularly in the area of fabrication process development and compatibility with inherent radome electrical and structural properties need to be addressed.
  Responder teams will include a description of management, cost, schedule, and technology development strategies envisioned for this effort.    The responder team will include their background and experience and how they relate to the successful integration of the FSS feature into a radome development.   

3.2 Frequency Selective Surface technologies of interest should meet the following criteria:
	A sub-component Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at start of  3 to 4 with the requirement to reach TRL 6 at completion
	Take less than 2.5 years for FSS technology to mature to TRL 6

<DESC>The Department of Treasury intends to issue a multiple-year, sole-source contract to Bulletin News LLC. Treasury officials must start each day fully informed about important news printed and broadcast nationwide. This is best accomplished via an expert-edited briefing memo that weaves together only the most the important elements of news stories printed and broadcast nationwide. The items must be culled from thousands of outlets daily and must be those that Treasury officials themselves would have identified as important.
<p><br />Treasury has determined that only Bulletin News offers all of the following in combination as required: (1) proven, extensive knowledge of Treasury and its mission; (2) use of human analysts to: (i) find and review articles and broadcasts from all major (and most smaller) daily newspapers, national television and cable news, most local television markets, newsweeklies, relevant magazines and journals, Internet sites, specialty press, etc.; (ii) apply its understanding of Treasury's mission and interests; (iii) determine which aspects of each story, if any, are important to the various constituencies within Treasury; (iv) edit out all information (not stories, but parts of stories) that is redundant or irrelevant; (v) for each topic in the briefing each day, weave the remaining (important) information together such that it reads like a single story rather than what it really is, subsets of myriad stories on the same topic; (vi) interweave news from all sources including print and television; and (vii) characterize the coverage such that Treasury officials can quickly get a sense for how widely various story elements were run and also for the general tonality of the coverage; (3) a "national news" section suitable to the needs of Treasury officials who must be kept aware of important developments affecting the federal government broadly so they may interact with peers in the Administration and Congress; (4) links within the briefing to the original full-text versions when available on the original publishers' websites and to streaming video of important television as originally broadcast,(5) weekday delivery, except federal holidays, by 7:30 a.m. EST via (i) a secure Treasury-specific, vendor-hosted website, including Bulletin News's archive of the Treasury News Summary; (ii) email, including PDA-friendly format; (iii) emerging technologies such as Kindle and iPad; and (iv) all the while ensuring all content is fresh, with very low incidence of day-old news; (6) include a Washington Schedule section for the important events scheduled that day; (7) be available to any and all employees of the Treasury, exclusively for Treasury's internal use; and (8) be supported by exceptional customer service. Bulletin News: (i) assigns a dedicated account manager who is expert on Treasury and its needs and is available to Treasury 24/7; (ii) permits Treasury to communicate with the editors preparing its service 24/7 so that its service can be customized quickly as necessary; and (iii) ensures quality by delivering copies of all written communication are delivered to the CEO of the company and to the Vice Presidents in charge of the account management and editorial functions. Bulletin News also offers the ability to have its editors score, using human judgment, the sentiment of various topics within stories and then process that data through formulas that include audience size, reputation and other factors to provide a sense for the overall tone of coverage over time. Bulletin News has demonstrated its ability to fulfill all of these requirements via its current, identical work for the White House and more than twenty federal Departments and Agencies, and also for numerous private-sector clients.</p>
<p>The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.1. The Government intends to acquire the service as a commercial item. The contract will be a small business set-aside under NAICS code 519130. Treasury anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price contract, with a base year plus four one year options.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may identify their interest by responding to the requirement. <strong>Interested organizations must submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the point of contact identified below not later than 5:00 p.m. EST/EDT on Dec. 17, 2010</strong>. A sample of a similar service delivered to a similar client must be included in order to facilitate Treasury's ability to judge the vendor's ability to fulfill the contract requirements. Interested organizations must demonstrate systematic capabilities, staffing, and management experience to deliver the complete service described above. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No solicitation is available. Responses must be received by the deadline described above.</p>

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA will temporarily postpone Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for the next 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 
GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.  
GSA will be closing the schedule to new offers as of October 1, 2010. All offers received prior to that date will be reviewed and considered for award if acceptable. Offers not received by the deadline will not be considered. Furthermore, those offers that have been rejected can only be resubmitted after the 24 month postponement period. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject any offer which is non-complaint.

Appropriate small and large animal studies may include efficacy, toxicity, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics. It is expected that data gathered under the resulting agreement will, in conjunction with other data generated by the offerors, enable filing of Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications with the US-FDA. The purpose of this RFP is NOT to fund basic research on nanoplatform development, RNAi compounds and animal models. It is also not intended to fund ALL necessary studies needed to file an IND or IDE.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>Commander (vpl) USCG Surface Forces Logistics Center</p>
<p>Dockside Repairs of CGC SEQUOIA (WLB 215)</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-R-P30J16 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal online form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>The purchase of 1 each, Agilent Network Analyzer, Model # N5230C-125<br />1 each, Agilent ECAL Module, Model # N4691B<br />2 each, Unique ID Labels (UID)</p>
<p>Mfr: Agilent Technologies, INC.<br />Justification for Brand Name Only: This piece of equipment is configured for Depot use only in the repair of two specific items of RADAR Avionic equipment for the F-15 Aircraft. Although other manufacturers have similar network analyzers, this brand name and model number should be purchased to preclude costly re-engineering test set configuration changes. Engineering has been funded to development of three additional test programs that require the use of a network analyzer. The requirement of the network analyzer was driven by the units under test (UUT) test specifications and the Agilent N5230C was chosen because it meets all test requirements. The Agilent N5230C provides commonality with other program(s) that we support. Engineering has invested approximately 2000+ hours in development of these test programs. If any other network analyzer is purchased; engineering will have to rewrite/reintegrate the test programs and the shop will have to revalidate the test programs. The estimated amount of engineering/testing costs to find other possible Network Analyzers that would work in this application would negate any cost savings of buying any other brand of Network Analyzer and the shop will experience unacceptable delays in production because of software changes and maturation testing.</p>
<p>Price(s) shall be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to SSgt James Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) no later than 03 January <br />2011, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-45 dated 1 Oct 2010 and DFARS Change Notice 20100802):<br /><br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7001<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (Appl if unit price exceeds $5K.)<br />DFARS 252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (WAWF is the method used by DoD for processing invoices/receiving reports.)</p>
<p>In accordance with Clause 52.212-2, the evaluation factors shall be technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, price, and past performance.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 52.212-3, Reps/Certs should be completed on-line at www.bpn.gov. <br />Oral procedures will not be used for this solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 1: Q&amp;A Follow-up<br /><br />Q: Is there an incumbent contractor at this time &amp;&nbsp;Who is the current contractor and their address?<br />A: No information about the current contractor will be provided.<br /><br />Q: Does USDA require a Utah Security Agency license, or is there a reciprocal agreement with out-of-state licensed companies?<br />A: The State of UT requires that a Security Guard Company be licensed in the State of UT, and the USDA does too.&nbsp; There are no reciprocal agreements.</p>
<p>Q: What is the anticipated time frame for performing the prospective employee background check once names are submitted to your office?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />A: There is no specific time frame - Homeland Security does the checks and the time varies.<br /><br />Q: Is sub-contracting authorized for this solicitation?<br />A: This is a total small business set aside, a small business sub-contracting plan is not required, and sub-contracting would be authorized.<br /><br />Q: If a guard has to be at the Front desk at all times then the patrol would have to be done by another person. If that's the case what is the required time for the patrol during the 9 1/2hrs shift?<br />A:&nbsp;There is no requirement in the solicitation that the front desk be covered at all times, the requirement is that the PREMISES be covered during the entire time frame.&nbsp; The term "station" may be being mis-interpreted as&nbsp;referring only to the front desk.&nbsp; It is properly interpreted as the PREMISES.<br /><br />Q:&nbsp;Could services could be provided by Utah Peace Officers or does&nbsp;it have to be a private security firm?<br />A: Yes, Utah Peace Officer may provide the service or a private security firm.&nbsp; There is no requirement for one or the other.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis for Project Number 101002: Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Number: FA8601-11-R-0002 (Formerly FA8601-10-R-0006)</strong><br /><br />The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to design, manage, and accomplish individual projects under the purview of Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. During the contract period, Base Civil Engineering will identify construction tasks and the Contracting Office will negotiate and issue individual task orders to the Contractor to complete them. Projects will be in support of real property maintenance, repair, alteration, and/or new construction. The work involved may include, but is not limited to minimal design (35%), carpentry, concrete, excavating, interior, electrical, steam fitting, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, masonry, and welding.</p>
<p>This requirement is restricted as a national 8(a) competitive set-aside pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1).</p>
<p>The estimated contract value is $82.5M. The guaranteed contract minimum will be $75,000. Traditionally, there have been upwards of 100 active SABER delivery orders at varying stages of completion at any given time. However, this historical data does not necessarily reflect future SABER requirements. The NAICS Code is 236220. The size standard is $33.5M.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued after 31 May 1998.

<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: The Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) Contract, at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, will be a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type for estimating and construction efforts. The period of performance is a 365 day base-year followed by four (4) 1-year option periods and a potential 6-month extension of services. This is a follow-on effort to the current SABER Bridge contract, FA8601-10-D-0009. Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager. The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract and partnering is encouraged. Liquidated damages, if applicable, shall be specified in each task order.</p>

<DESC>Paragraph 3.1 of the RFI is changed to state that comments and input are to be submitted no later than 1:00 CST, 26 Jan 2011."<BR><BR>In addtion to the above, the following clarifications are provided:<BR><BR>1.  Question:  Is it the Government's intent to obtain a larger sample of information of historical helicopter programs across the Industry in order to refine the Army's data base related to aircraft development?<BR><BR>	Response:  The Army's intent is not to refine the Army's data base related to aircraft development. <BR><BR>2.  Question:  Is it your intent, therefore, that OEMs not submit information with respect to the same airframe as for previous RFI, but rather general information of helicopters regardless of size, power, weight, performance or production status that each OEM has previously (historically) developed? <BR><BR>	Response:  Correct.  The Army's request is not specific to aircraft previously addressed via the previous RFI, but the OEM's historical experience from a macro perspective.  If platforms previously addressed by OEMs can contribute to the response, such prior experience can be included in the RFI response. <BR><BR>3.  Question:  Can you clarify the page limit for respondents who may wish to cite multiple examples of past performance?  Specifically, does the 15 page limit apply to each example of past performance, or is it an overall limit for all examples?  <BR><BR>	Response:  The intent is to limit the total response to 15 pages.  Specifically, the RFI is geared towards concise responses.  Use of tables and/or figures that encapsulate the respondent's experience is encouraged.<BR><BR>4.  Question:  There are potential past performance examples that pre-date the TD/EMD paradigm for RDT&E or were commercial developments.  In these instances, is the most reasonable course to provide an overall development figure as a proxy for TD/EMD?<BR><BR>	Response:  Yes.  Also, within the context of such an overall construct, if there are unique and/or exceptional circumstances where significant cost and/or schedule savings resulted, it would be beneficial to highlight these.<BR><BR>5.  Question:  Appendix A asks for range in "Empty" configuration.  Empty weight typically means no crew and fuel, which does not make sense in the context of a range calculation, so are we correct to assume that "Empty" means "no payload"?  To us this means providing for the weight of flight crew and a full tank of gas, but assuming no additional payload.  Is the correct interpretation?  Is there any specific guidance on the weight allowance for the crew?  <BR><BR>	Response:  Empty weight includes the basic air vehicle weight, and does not include avionics or electrical system weight, crew, gear or any payloads or armor protection.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>MRAP VISUAL SENSOR MARKET SURVEY<BR><BR>A.  DESCRIPTION OF INTENT<BR> <BR>The Program Executive Office Combat Systems and Combat Support Systems (PEO CS&CSS), Joint Program Office Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (JPO MRAP) is conducting a market survey to collect written information from Industry to ascertain the current market's capability to integrate visual sensors onto the MRAP family of vehicles.<BR><BR>The Army seeks to improve situational awareness for Warfighters within the MRAP vehicle.  This situational awareness system requires an upgrade to the current suite of visual sensors to increase visibility of the surrounding environment.<BR><BR>The parameters of the desired visual sensor cameras are as follows:  <BR><BR>The visual sensors must contain both a daytime color and infrared visualization capability.  It is assumed that each sensor includes two cameras: one for color daytime capability and one for infrared capability.  If a single camera can accomplish both capabilities simultaneously, references to separate cameras can be assumed to apply to the single camera.  Both cameras must have a horizontal Field of View (FOV) no less than 40 degrees; and, a vertical FOV no less than 30 degrees. The daytime color camera must detect an upright, stationary adult in fair weather no less than 180 meters away; and, the infrared camera must do the same no less than 250 meters away.  The sensor must reside upon a mechanical pan-tilt system with a pan range of no less than 360 degrees (continuous) and tilt range of at least +90 / -30 degrees elevation.  The daytime color camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 768V x 494H; whereas, the infrared camera must output analog video in accordance with SMPTE-170M-2004 with a minimum resolution of 640V x 480H.  The sensor unit must provide a serial control interface via RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 half duplex; and, the pan-tilt unit must provide a control bus interface via RS-485 half duplex.  The sensor and pan-tilt unit must have Built-In Test (BIT) capability for fault detection/isolation. The latency from either camera must not exceed 35 milliseconds from point of image capture to distribution on a video or data network.  The sensor unit must be ruggedized to military standards.<BR><BR>Respondents should be companies that have proven capabilities as a vehicle system integrator and can ruggedize sensor technologies to military standards.  This survey is not intended to address individual technologies, rather we are interested in the sensor package as a whole that meets all parameters above.    This survey does not aim to address immature technological capabilities.  Respondents should include information regarding production readiness and justification of stated capabilities.<BR><BR>B.  GENERAL INFORMATION<BR><BR>The submission of information in response to this market survey is for planning purposes only; and, it must not be construed as a commitment by the United States Government to procure any items or services described herein, or for the Government to pay for the information received.<BR><BR>Respondents that cannot address all of the market survey questions in this RFI need not respond.  Receipt of an incomplete market survey will not be reviewed.<BR><BR>As a condition of responding to this survey, it is a requirement that potential responders be a United States (US) company, and possesses the means to properly store and work on information and hardware classified at the SECRET/No Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) level.<BR><BR>Participation in this market survey is strictly voluntary and the U.S. Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.<BR><BR>This is not a pre-solicitation notice.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal; and, it must not be construed as a solicitation; and, no award shall be made on the basis of this notice.  No formal solicitation is available at this time.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to modify contract N00178-10-C-1019, which previously procured Production Engineering Services related to Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) T46D system equipment for units procured under contract number N00178-09-C-1021.
  The contract was awarded on a sole source basis to AP Labs Inc.  This modification is also anticipated to be awarded on a sole source basis to the same company.  As the original equipment manufacturer and owner of all proprietary drawings and hardware, award will be made to AP Labs, Inc., located at 10864 Thornmint Road, San Diego, CA, 92127.  The closing date is 4:00 PM ET on 10 December  2010.  The anticipated award date is 04 February 2011.   
This modification will add production engineering services procured under contract N00178-10-C-1012 to existing contract N00178-10-C-1019 that provides production engineering services inclusive of reviews, analysis and assessments of technical documentation for production related impacts and potential material obsolescence implications that affect BFTT components, and furnishing of technical drawings.
 This will be added as new FMS CLIN 0003 and 1003.  

Questions may be submitted to crystal.breen@navy.mil or faxed to (540) 653-7088; Telephone#:  (540) 653-8724.  Please reference RFP N00178-10-R-1019 on any correspondence.

<DESC>GLAES Notice - Request for SF-330 Submission<br />
<p><br />The Great Lakes Architect-Engineer Services (GLAES) contracts will be providing professional architect/engineer, technical and management services to support contaminated sediment design activities, habitat restoration design/evaluation support, and contaminated sediment remedial oversight. These contracts will support the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO).</p>
<p>The contracts are planned to be an ID/IQ contracts with firm fixed-price task orders, each with an estimated contract value of $25,000,000. Two (2) contracts will be awarded, a full and open (SOL-R5-10-00006-1), and a small business set-aside (SOL-R5-10-00007). The NAICS code is 562910, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The SF-330 Architect-Engineer Qualifications are due by January 14, 2011 at 4:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.</p>
<p>Information regarding this acquisition is posted on:</p>
<p>http://www.epa.gov/region5/business/aescontracting.htm</p>
<p>The contract specialist for the full and open (SOL-R5-10-00006-1) procurement is Mr. Michael Dunneback. He can be reached at dunneback.michael@epa.gov. The contract specialist for the Small Business Set-Aside (SOL-R5-10-00007) procurement is Spencer Hamilton. He can be reached at Hamilton.spencer@epa.gov. The Placement Contracting Officer for these procurements is David Alberts. He can be reached at alberts.david@epa.gov.</p>
<p>SF 330 PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Total Government Requirement</p>
<p>(a) The GLNPO's estimated Sediment Remediation Design (SDR) requirements, if split evenly between the two contracts, would result in two equal contracts reaching the requirement limits exactly. For proposal purposes, firms should assume that these contracts represent more than 2 of the GLNPO requirements.</p>
<p>(b) This will allow the Government to respond to unexpected but potential:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractors ineligibility to perform work (e.g., due to conflicts of interest)<br />&bull; Contractors inferior past performance</p>
<p>(c) Though EPA does not specifically anticipate such needs, it reserves the right to issue task orders under these contracts in excess of 2 of the requirement. In no event will the value of the total Task Orders issued under either of the contracts exceed the maximum contract value.</p>
<p>General Proposal Instructions</p>
<p>For this procurement, EPA requires firms to organize their information in the SF 330 and any additional documentation, as described below. EPA will evaluate firms SF 330s and additional documentation on the five evaluation criteria listed below.</p>
<p>Firms should submit 10 hard-copies and one electronic copy (on disc in a MS Word or PDF Format) of their SF 330s. If documents are submitted utilizing Portable Document Format (PDF) firms shall follow the conventions described under the accessibility guidelines which are described in the authoring tools section of Acrobat Reader. For more information on this guidance, please visit www.section508.gov.</p>
<p>Following the Architect/Engineer Evaluation Board's (AEEB) review of the SF 330 and supporting documentation, the AEEB will develop a "short list" of the most highly rated firms. The short-listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."</p>
<p>The source selection authority will make the final ranking from among those "selected firms." The top ranked firm will then be asked to submit:</p>
<p>&bull; Conflict of Interest Plan<br />&bull; Quality Management Plan<br />&bull; Representations and Certifications<br />&bull; Cost Proposal</p>
<p>Instructions for the preparation for each of these submissions will only be provided to the firm with whom EPA intends to conduct negotiations.</p>
<p>Specific Proposal Instructions</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: PEO STRI Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Foreign Military Sales (APM FMS) is upgrading existing ranges and targetry to include the installation of electronic communications equipment between the Tactical Maneuver Area and the Fixed Base Facility on the Multi-Purpose Range Complex. APM FMS is submitting a Sources Sought Notification for a Technical Capabilities Statement, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), and an estimated Performance Schedule that will fulfill the Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG) range(s) modernization program to include information on potential offerors' products and types of services.<BR><BR>The technical capabilities statement shall respond to the following areas of interest:<BR><BR>The FMS SANG Range Modernization Program upgrades existing ranges and targetry installation on newly constructed ranges. These live-fire ranges shall be used to train everything from small arms familiarization and qualification on Automated Record Fire (ARF) to collective Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) qualification conducted on a Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC).  All target lifting mechanisms on all the ranges are made by Meggitt Training Systems.  The Technical Capabilities solution must be compatible with these target mechanisms: <BR><BR>* DP62-Moving Armor Target <BR>* AA25-Stationary Armor Target<BR>* DP 26-Moving Infantry Target<BR>* AA10-Stationary Infantry Target<BR><BR>Part of this effort includes installation of electronic communications equipment between the Tactical Maneuver Area and the Fixed Base Facility on the MPRC to hardwired control of individual targets on ARF rifle qualification ranges. Ranges will be powered by generators. Range construction is NOT a part of this effort, assume new construction. (See Attachment A - KAA Range Complex and Attachment B - Shadgum Range Complex for the noted Hardware and Software requirements for each range.)<BR><BR>The terrain is generally flat and should not interfere with electronic transmissions.  For purposes of this request, assume new construction on Range 1, 3, 12 A/12B, and 15, including firing positions, target pits, and control towers. On Range 24 assume the maneuver element to be a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) Company, 16 vehicles and 150 fitted with One-MILES that will transmit data to the Fixed Base Facility via the Range Control System (RCS) deployed at the Control Tower. The RCS must be able to trigger events based on player location data provided by the Lockheed Martin's One-MILES Player Unit system being deployed by SANG in the maneuver area.<BR><BR>Ranges 8, 11, 20, 21, 24 AARs must also be compatible with Lockheed Martin's One-MILES, One-MILES player unit and range communication solution, currently being procured by SANG in order to allow Force on Target training and Event trigger capability. In addition, the AAR capability must be designed for LAV section, platoon, and company level training. <BR><BR>The Target System shall replicate the behavior of the threat presentations, dismounted stationary and moving individuals and combat and non-combat vehicles to a scale suitable for tasks being trained. The Target Systems must meet the following general requirements:<BR>* Communicate with the RCS, the Hand Held Controllers (HHC), and with the scoring system Lane Monitors (LM) in near real time<BR>* Score and time tag hits detected either through the Precision Scoring System or the standard lifter mounted hit sensor<BR>* Portray target thermal signature <BR>* Interface with One-MILES and MILES shoot back devices<BR>* Provide interface to Sound Effects Simulator (SES), and non-pyro Battle Effects Simulators (BES)<BR>* Provide GPS interface for automatic mapping by the RCS and for event trigger based on Moving target location<BR>Precision Scoring System<BR><BR>The Precision Scoring System shall consist of a sensing system deployed at the target emplacement, and Lane Monitors deployed at shooter locations. The Precision Scoring System provides the means to accurately depict the shot location data to the shooter and the training audience in near real time. This information can be used for zeroing, grouping, and for more effective precision gunnery training. <BR><BR>The Precision Scoring System shall meet the following requirements:<BR>* Easily attached to the associated target lifter system<BR>* Power and data must be associated with target lifter system<BR>* Not require any calibration or adjustments when deployed at the target emplacement <BR>* Report hits and misses to the RCS and to the associated Lane Monitor<BR>* Detect spatial positions for rounds <BR>* Target center shall be determined automatically when the type of target is set.<BR>* Accuracy shall be within 10mm of actual projectile location for infantry targets and within 60mm of actual projectile location for vehicle targets<BR>* Detection zone shall extend to a minimum of 1 meter in all directions beyond the actual target silhouette perimeter<BR>* System shall not require user input to achieve the required accuracy<BR>* System shall register not less than 97% of the rounds that pass through the detection zone<BR><BR>The Lane Monitor (LM) shall meet the following requirements:<BR><BR>* Capable of displaying shot information simply, accurately, and clearly in all possible light conditions including at night<BR>* Weight and construction shall be such that it can be deployed on a stand and be carried by one hand while operated by the other <BR>* Capable of displaying the shot results of any lane individually, multiple lanes or the entire range<BR>* Capable of controlling all the targets on the associated lane.

<DESC>This post-award notification for the Crescent house Repairs Project is made pursuant to FAR 15.503:
 All SDVOSB vendors were solicited by our contracting office on this RFP through www.FBO.gov. Four vendors submitted a proposal to our office for consideration. One proposal was eliminated from the competitive, leaving three proposals that were carefully  reviewed by the Source Selection Board and by the Contracting Department.
This is a Best Value determination, integrating the evaluation of Past Performance, Technical Proposal and Price. Past Performance and Technical are of equal weight, but when combined are significantly more important than is Price.  
 On 09/23/2010, It was determined that Lincoln Construction Group presented the best overall value and was awarded this contract in the amount of $689,000.00.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of a Medtronic Midas Rex Legend EHS Stylus High-Speed Drill package for the VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, WI.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Medtronic. 

3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Medical Center in Milwaukee has a requirement for the instrument package in order to perform cranial neurosurgery.  The only compatible drill with the current equipment owned by the VA is the Midas Rex Legend EHS Stylus High-Speed Drill.  The purchase of this drill would allow for ease of switching between the two devices if one should fail due to the parts being compatible.  The approximate cost is $26,546.10. 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Medical Center in Milwaukee will be performing well over 30 procedures a year using the StealthStation S7 System.  The Midas Rex package is an integral component of the StealthStation System.  The cost to the government of acquiring the Midas Rex package is significantly less than the cost to outsource.  In addition, the Zablocki VAMC will serve as a VISN resource for neurological procedures using the Midas Rex resulting in cost savings among a number of hospitals in the VISN.  If the VA were not to obtain this particular product we lose the ability to perform surgeries necessary for our veterans on-site.  These surgeries would then have to be performed off-site and the veterans would need to travel for their treatment.

Medtronic is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Midas Rex. 

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  Web-based research indicated surgical drills offered by other companies would not be compatible with the current surgical drill the VA owns.  The compatibility between the two drills would allow for back-up parts to be readily available if one should fail.  If the VA were to purchase a different type of drill, the ease of back-up parts would not be possible.  Additionally, the medical staff would not need to operate differing devices depending on which device was readily available.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The vendor has offered the VA GSA pricing on all items included in this procurement and a government discount.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The Contracting Officer conducted additional research.  The COTR and end users have researched the market and were unable to locate any additional competition for this requirement.

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
