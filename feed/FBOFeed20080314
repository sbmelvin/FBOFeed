<DESC>The incumbent will play a key role in identifying the regions needs and defining the scope of the work/role that needs to be carried out by the incumbent and RDMA to meet the needs, as well as taking a lead in establishing the parameters and expectations of the job in reference to working with other missions and organizations in the region.   

Over the next 20 years no other region is likely to match the influence of Asia on global prosperity and well being.  A broad consensus on the desirability of market driven economic growth to eradicate poverty has enabled unprecedented growth rates and stimulated a deepening of regional collaboration.  However, growth itself is creating new sources of instability that threaten progress and US interests.  These threats include global climate change, conflict over resources, inequitable growth, disease, and weak states. The RDMA strategy proposes to help manage these threats, while costs are still minimal, through the use of bilateral and regional programs in ways that strengthen regional cooperation and interdependence.

RDMA carries out six distinct functions as follows:  

1.	managing regional programs (in FY 07 approximately 33% of staff time);
2.	managing bilateral programs in six (Burma, China, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Vietnam) non or limited presence countries (NPC/LPC) in the region, including the provision of support services (in FY 07 approximately 57% of staff time);
3.	providing varying levels of procurement, financial, administrative, and legal support services to four presence countries (in FY 07 approximately 6% of staff time); 
4.	providing technical services to other USAID Missions and programs (in FY 07 approximately 1% of staff time for facilitating Global Development Alliances and HIV/AIDS activities in the region); 
5.	hosting personnel of two other operating units: USAID/Afghanistan?s Office of Acquisition and Assistance/East and OFDA?s Asia office (in FY 07 approximately 3% of staff time); and
6.	providing the agency the flexibility and surge capacity to respond to fast breaking events and to manage budgetary earmarks and directives. 

The Regional Education Advisor for Asia  will principally provide technical expertise and services in Basic and Higher Education required to facilitate a growing emphasis on human resource development, education for all, integrating education as a tool to address drivers of conflict and preparing Asian workforces and citizenry to succeed in a rapidly globalizing and changing 21st Century.
The Regional Education Advisor for Asia (including Central Asia) is responsible for providing technical leadership and expertise to USAID programs and key partners across Asia. On occasion depending on Agency priorities and Mission demand the advisor will be called upon to support USAID education indicatives in the Near East as well. The RDMA?s regional Education Advisor for Asia will liaise closely with ANE?s Office of Technical Services (ANE/TS) and with EGAT?s Education Offices.
The advisor?s principal responsibilities include: designing and conducting diagnostics of the constraints and challenges to improving the performance of the education sector in Asia with special emphasis in areas that constitute hotbeds of human conflict and destruction;  identifying  opportunities and proven approaches for a USAID response that is based on USAID?s comparative advantage in the sector; assisting USAID Missions to design, evaluate and monitor programs to address national priorities; fostering regional integration and approaches, and promoting policy harmonization for improving access to quality education.  To successfully carry out his/her responsibilities, the Regional Education Advisor is expected to travel throughout Asia (including Central Asia and occasionally the near East) and the U.S. as required. 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  The Regional Education Advisor for Asia will report to an RDMA Office Chief or equivalent (final place within the organization to be finalized) and receive overall direction from Mission Management.   The contractor will provide leadership for informing USAID policy, program and activity design and performance monitoring in the education sector in Asia.  To this end s/he will:

1.	Lead education sector diagnostics and analyses for informing program strategy and activity development and funding decisions for support to the education sector.  To this end, draft and finalize scopes of work, terms of reference and selection criteria for the Technical Assistance (TA) required to conduct the diagnostics.     

2.	Identify points of intersection for introducing education support as a cross-cutting theme to existing regional programs in order to maximize USAID RDMA program and activity complementarities and return to investment. 
  
3.	Develop a  sub-regional road map for South-East Asia to guide USAID efforts to: (a) achieve greater regional integration in issues and policies dealing principally with education, and secondarily with those of a cross-cutting nature essential to sustainable growth; (b) spur the improvement of workforce skills, enhance the regional pool of skilled workers, and improve labor competitiveness required for the region to successfully participate in an expanding and diversifying regional and global economy; (c) attract greater foreign and domestic investment flows in support of basic and higher education initiatives; and (d) secure a long-term commitment from public and private partners towards meeting the financial needs for improving regional performance of the education sector.  This roadmap will serve as a model for discussion and possible replication within and among ASEAN members and with other Asian sub-regions.  It is foreseen that, subject to demand, the Advisor would lead and similar planning initiatives in the other sub-regions as appropriate.

4.	Provide expert guidance to USAID field Missions principally in Asia for carrying out country level education sector assessments, and promote linkages where appropriate, with other sectors for encouraging sustainable development.

5.	Provide written technical input and analyses for the preparation of required USAID documents including relevant USAID sections of annual Operational Plans, Mission Strategic Plans, Country Assistance Strategies, country core team reviews of proposed budgets, indicator reporting.
6.	Prepare scopes of work for procuring and conducting evaluations, assessments and strategic information systems  aimed at assessing progress and lessons leaned and the effectiveness of  USAID-supported efforts by grantees and contractors.

7.	Represent USAID RDMA at: (a) USG interagency regional meetings and U.S. Country Team meetings as required to provide briefings and articulate strategic recommendations on future programming needs for education sector support; and (b)   regional organizations such as ASEAN, APEC, and multilateral institutions including UNESCO, the World Bank, the Asian development Bank and similar organizations.

8.	Provide input to the preparation of briefing materials and talking points on the education sector for use by senior USAID leadership and other USG entities; and draft responses and memoranda as appropriate, to questions posed by Congress or USAID Washington Offices on budgeting, strategic, and programming issues including performance overviews.  

9.	Collaborate with the RDMA development outreach communications specialist (DOCS) and LPA to ensure timely provision of media-friendly (newsprint, radio, web-based) information on USAID-supported education initiatives in Asia. 

10.	Identify and promote opportunities for forging Global development Alliances  in the education sector in support of the Administrator?s Initiative to leverage significant public and private resources  to complement and support USAID efforts in catalyzing the dissemination of proven techniques and approaches as appropriate within the region, and promoting joint programming with regional financial institutions and donor agencies.  

11.	Serve as an RDMA Activity or Program Manager and in this role manage contracts and/or assistance awards as required (i.e. serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer) for effective and optimal use of USAID resources.   

12.	Perform other duties and tasks as may be assigned.

To successfully carry out the above duties and responsibilities, it is estimated that 70% - 80% of the incumbent's time will be devoted to providing technical advice and surge support to other USAID Missions and programs, and 20% - 30% to management of regional programs, and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
1.	Background

Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere is now facing the challenge of implementing free and fair municipal elections in November 2008.  USAID is committed to strengthening electoral processes in the country with a strong program supporting transparent election processes, increased and informed voter participation, robust objective oversight, inclusive political party participation and increased civic advocacy.  Recent national activities, however, have revealed a number of flaws in the process of registering voters, a lack of inclusive political party participation and recent government intrusion on civil society activities.

In recognition of the strategic importance of the 2008 municipal elections, USAID/Nicaragua has formed a special Elections Unit consisting of one USPSC Director, a dedicated Foreign Service National (FSN) municipal elections specialist with part time support from other FSN democracy specialists, and other staff to be drawn from other sections as required during the critical run up to the Municipal elections, November, 2008.  USAID/Nicaragua wishes to contract with an individual under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) to serve as Director for the newly formed Elections and Political Processes Unit (EPP Unit) who will be responsible for planning, designing, managing and monitoring USAID-funded Elections and Political Processes (EPP) related activities.

STATEMENT OF WORK
USAID/Nicaragua Senior Advisor, Democracy and Economic Growth

Nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere; weak civil society organizations, an almost non-existent industrial base and agriculture-based economy allied with poor health care and a high illiteracy rate have made transition to an economically and politically stable state a challenge.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market survey. Background: The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a safety-critical system that provides accurate precise navigation and landing guidance to equipped aircraft in any weather. The WAAS augments the United States Government (USG) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The primary mission of the WAAS is to provide a means for air navigation during all phases of flight in the National Airspace System (NAS); departure, en route and approach.  The WAAS augments GPS with the following three services: a ranging function, which improves availability and reliability; differential GPS corrections, which improve accuracy; and integrity monitoring, which improves safety.   The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is a ground-based augmentation to GPS that focuses its service on the airport area (approximately a 20-30 mile radius) for precision approach, departure procedures and terminal area operations. It broadcasts its correction message via a very high frequency (VHF) radio data link from a ground-based transmitter. LAAS will yield the extremely high accuracy, availability, and integrity necessary for Category I, II, and III precision approaches, and will provide the ability for flexible, curved approach paths.  Scope of Work: In support of WAAS Phase III, significant technical refresh and reliability modifications will occur.  These modifications include development of an engineering model reference receiver that is L1C, L2C and L5 capable; improved WAAS processing for ionospheric estimation, scintillation robustness, and signal quality (evil waveform) monitoring; and incorporation of additional geostationary satellites and associated ground facilities.   Integration of these enhancements must be seamless to WAAS users.  The system must continue to satisfy the stringent integrity requirements demanded of this safety of life navigation service. Integration of the new Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites into WAAS requires knowledge of signal generation simulation and modeling.   To satisfy the above requirements, versatile systems engineering support as well as an in-depth understanding of the WAAS architecture and integrity design are required. The FAA requires senior systems engineering support for WAAS.  As well as, dedicated technical engineering support to GNSS modernization and LAAS.  The following tasks provide additional details on support activities sought by the FAA. It should be noted that inherent in these tasks are requirements for detailed knowledge of GPS receiver signal processing and design, an equivalent understanding of GNSS measurement processing and integrity algorithms,  and a mature GPS receiver and antenna test capability including access to an anechoic chamber.  Additionally, contractors shall have a demonstrated Radio Frequency (RF) interference survey, investigation capability and participation in forums on RF interference and GNSS modernization.  An in-depth, thorough, comprehensive knowledge of WAAS and LAAS corrections generation, processing threads, integrity design, and an analytical support for WAAS modifications is required. The ability to perform this work with a minimal to no learning curve is required.   All interested parties are advised the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. At this time, the nature of a future competition has not been determined.  Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms to respond to this survey may result in a sole source contract being awarded. In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors: 1.	Capability statement - This should identify past performance references for the last five years for work performed of a similar type.  (Limited to five (5) pages) 2.	Technical Qualifications and Capabilities - Provide a description of the organizations qualifications and capabilities in each of the areas described in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) (Limited to 25 pages) 3.	Sample Resumes - These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel.  Individual resumes are limited to two (2) pages. All submissions must be received to the following address by March 27,2008 at 2:00 PM EST: Federal Aviation Administration 800 Independence Avenue, SW Room 412 Washington, DC  20591 ATTN:  Ms. Vida Tarpley             Contract Specialist If there are questions regarding this market survey, please contact Ms. Vida Tarpley at (202) 267-3668.

<DESC>This project is located on Lower Cove Run in Eastern Hardy County, West Virginia near the Town of Lost River.  

Work will consist of the following:  

A.1-  Additional Phase I work is needed on approximately 43 acres adjacent to a previous archaeological study for Lost River.  The use of archival and field methods will be needed to determine the number and kinds of cultural resources that may be affected by planned activities.

B.1-  Phase II Archaeological Evaluation on three prehistoric sites; 
B.2-  Providing complete documentation as to the nature and character of each site; and 
B.3-  Making significance determinations of each site.  

One site is a large lithic scatter with diagnostic projectile points located on a terrace on the south side of Lower Cove Run.  The other two sites, one small and one large, are lithic scatters with no diagnostic artifacts and are located in the floodplain on the north side of Lower Cove Run.  All three sites have been extensively plowed and are currently hayfield or pasture.

The use of mechanical stripping in addition to test unit excavation is a possibility at these three sites.  At the three lithic scatter sites, the plow zone extends to a depth of between twenty and twenty-seven centimeters below surface. Nearly all artifacts were recovered in the plow zone from these three sites.  

The estimated price range for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000.  The required performance time is 95 calendar days.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about March 29, 2008.  

Interested offerors may register at www.fbo.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.  All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency.

PLEASE NOTE:  The General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons.  Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps website for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.

<DESC>Note 22 Applies.  The Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) collects pavement condition data that are used by the National Park Service to manage its road network.  The equipment used to collect the pavement condition data, the Automated Road Analyzer (ARAN), is reaching the end of its useful life.  Since the time the ARAN was purchased, there have been many changes in the technology used to collect pavement condition data.  Therefore, EFLHD intends to enter into a contract with Applied Pavement Technology, Inc. to procure services of a Pavement Management Specialist to review options available, recommend equipment specifications for the purchase of a new vehicle, and to develop procedures to maximize the compatibility of data collected with the new equipment with data collected in the previous cycles.  The project also includes an assessment of any changes needed to the current calculation of pavement condition indexes and recommendations for making the appropriate changes.  The project culminates in the development of a final report that summarizes the findings and presents the recommended actions.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $56,000.00.

<DESC>This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the masonry restoration of the Fa?ade of the William J. Nealon Federal Building at 235 N. Washington Avenue in Scranton, PA. The ornamental terra cotta cornice on the building is in disrepair and in need of some restoration.  Water has infiltrated the structure and caused the support steel to rust and expand causing cracks and irregularities in the cornice itself.  The cornice will be incrementally removed and if possible salvaged.  While removed, the support steel will be replaced and repaired where applicable.  Portions of the fa?ade will be repointed and some dutchman repairs are necessary.  Window lintels will be repaired or replaced as necessary.  Large cracks in the masonry will be repaired and associated masonry units will be replaced in kind.  Decorative metal flag poles attached to the fa?ade will be restored to their original appearance.  Sections of the fluting on the marble engaged columns have chipped away and also need some repairs.  The front entrance steps will need some repointing and the railings will be repaired.  Once everything is addressed, the exterior of the building will need a thorough cleaning.  A micro-abrasive cleaning system will be employed to achieve the level of cleanliness established in the mock-ups.  Where a biocide/antimicrobial agent indicated will also be utilized. The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on terra cotta cornice of the building.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: projects with masonry restoration and terra cotta replacement of an office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) that have been completed in the last 10 years of approximately $1 million dollars or more.  The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 300 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. Award will be full and open competition.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, current projects, Team Organization/Communication qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals  The acquisition process shall consist of two phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing selected drawings and a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors.  Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will provide notification to each firm with regards to their technical rating.  This phase also consists of receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer).  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award without discussions.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1- Past Performance on five (5) projects of similar scope and complexity, 2- Key Personnel & Experience.   The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238140.  This procurement is being solicited under Full and Open Competition with a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting firms that may be interested in performing a Cafeteria/Food Court Services Contract, including the recognized state licensing agency for the blind for Alabama (Alabama SLA). The Alabama SLA is solicited in order for GSA to comply with the Randolph-Sheppard Act and its implementing regulations at 34 Code of Federal Regulations 395.33 (a) and (b) and 35 (f). 

The contractor shall establish and operate in the contractors name the noncommercial food service facilities for the purpose of dispensing food, nonalcoholic beverages, catering services, and other items as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with all terms and conditions of the solicitation. The contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective performance of all services described in the forthcoming solicitation.  

Approximately 2,100 Federal employees occupy the subject Federal Building. The cafeteria facility, located on the Main Floor, occupies approximately 9,100 square feet with a seating capacity of 175 in the dining area and approximately 40 seats in Reserved Dining Area. Hours of cafeteria operation will be 5 days per week, Monday through Friday (except holidays observed by the Federal Government), as follows: Breakfast 6:15 am to 8:15 am, AM Break 9:00 am to 10:00 am, and Luncheon 11:00 am to 1:30 pm.

The contract will be competitively negotiated. It is GSA's policy to award cafeteria contracts to SLAs that have satisfactorily demonstrated capabilities to operate contract facilities. It should therefore be noted that an award to any SLA which would result in the facility being actively managed and operated by other than a licensed blind vendor (that is, by subcontract) is not acceptable and will be summarily rejected by the Contracting Officer. If the Alabama SLA determines to prepare and submit a proposal, the SLA should send a notice of its action to the Secretary of the US Department of Education in compliance with 34 CFR 395.31 (c).

Contract term will be structured as follows: Five (5) Year Base Period and two (2), five (5) year option periods that can be exercised by the Government.

The NAICS code for this solicitation is 722310. Food Service Contractors. The solicitation package will address details for structuring proposals.

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on-site, at the Birmingham Social Security Center, 1200 8th Avenue North, Birmingham, AL, on Tuesday April 22nd at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. 

The Solicitation package will be available electronically for download through the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). Please direct any general or solicitation access questions through email to Wes Zehms (Wesley.zehms@gsa.gov). Solicitation issue date will be on or about April 1, 2008.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) FOR: Research and Development Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) anticipates issuance of a sole source, cost plus fixed fee contract to Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), Southwest Research Institute, 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, Texas 78238-5166, for the Chemical and Biological Testing and Diagnostic Development and Verification Services in Support of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Defeat Program.  Under this effort, SwRI will test the innovative weapons technology being developed by and for DTRA; analyze the results of those tests against simulated biological and chemical agents in contractor provided facilities; and develop and verify new and innovative diagnostic techniques and procedures for testing these weapons.  This proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The effort will require facilities certified and acceptable for large volumes of test in support of DTRA?s WMD Defeat Program?s live simulant sub-scale testing (1/4 scale explosive force).  The facilities must be capable of testing in terms of: (1) the amount of explosive that can be used in single test, (2) live simulant instrumentation, plume containment and handling.  Additionally, the facility must be Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified and approved for Chemical and Biological sub-scale live simulant Agent Defeat (AD) weapon testing.  Support services for technology development, validation, test evaluations, and studies related to biological and chemical agent WMD Defeat missions for DTRA?s Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction Program must also be provided.  SwRI is the only responsible source capable of supporting the aforementioned requirements.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to make a contract award and does not authorize the contractor to incur pre-contract costs.  Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the support and services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors? representatives must be United States citizens.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.

<DESC>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award an eight month bridge contract to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions for support of Obscura, Mission Integration, and Network Support (OMINS) to the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) while a competitive source selection is conducted.  Lockheed Martin is currently providing this support to 22 SOPS under the Command and Control Sustainment Contract (CCSC) with the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC).
 
OMINS provides the 22nd Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)-wide support to new and existing satellite programs, external users, tracking stations, and operational complexes.  

Obscura support provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as obscura data) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data.  Additionally, obscura data is also collected when new antennas are installed or updated to identify the optimal location that maximizes the time for reception and transmission of satellite data.  Obscura support also analyzes data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended transmit inhibit zones for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from exposure.

Mission Integration (MI) provides an array of support activities that include evaluating new satellite requirements for AFSCN compatibility, network integration support (for new programs, satellites, and network resources), AFSCN integration test support, technical consultation for launch/on-orbit problem isolation and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.

Network Support (NS) is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central network repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to mission success.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 13, OTS hereby publishes this intent to negotiate and enter into a sole source purchase order with Marx Enterprises to support its conversion of its HR and payroll system to Treasury's HR Connect system and to the USDA's National Finance Center (NFC).  The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) currently administers in-house a full range of HR and payroll services for a workforce of approximately 1,100 employees located at its Washington headquarters and at five regional offices.  Planning for this conversion effort is currently underway, and conversion is expected to occur during NFC's 2008 pay period 17 (August 17 - 30, 2008) and HR Connect's pay period 18 (August 31 - September 13, 2008).  Objective and Scope:  The objective of this contract is to help OTS and its partners at Treasury and NFC successfully migrate OTS payroll and HR processing to HR Connect and NFC by independently verifying and validating OTS, Treasury and NFC project efforts. The Contractor shall apply his or her expertise in similar payroll conversion efforts to constructively engage with OTS and its partners in effectively planning and executing the migration to HR Connect/NFC.  Tasks:  Tasks and activities in support of the objective described above include: - Reviewing and analyzing project plans, test plans, risk management plans, and other documentation produced by OTS and its partners at Treasury and NFC; - Preparing work plans, schedules and other project documents necessary to manage this independent verification and validation effort; and - Designing, conducting and providing support for capability and performance tests of OTS's payroll and HR functions in the new HR Connect/NFC operating environment.  Frequent collaboration with OTS management and the Treasury/NFC implementation team will be required to successfully perform the tasks identified above.  Deliverables:  Analytical Reports.  As directed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the Contractor shall make oral and/or written presentations to OTS, Treasury or NFC staff on any of the topics described in sections (2) and (3) above.  Included in this category of deliverable are plans necessary to support analysis activities - for example, test plans - as well as participation in or support of the analysis activities themselves.  Weekly Status Reports and Meetings.  The Contractor shall provide the COTR with a Status Report for each work week during which the Contractor works hours billable under this contract.  The Contractor shall work with the COTR to determine the format and content of the Status Report.  The Contractor shall make him or herself available to meet with the COTR on at least a weekly basis to discuss the Status Report and other project issues.  Place of Performance: Work under this contract shall be performed at the Contractor's place of business, at OTS Headquarters in Washington, D.C. or, as necessary, at Treasury facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Occasional travel outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area may be required; all travel outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area shall be approved in advance by the COTR.  The Contractor shall not invoice OTS for travel within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  Hours: Meetings and teleconferences requiring the Contractor's participation shall generally be scheduled during normal OTS business hours (9:00am through 5:00pm, ET.)  The Contractor shall agree with the COTR on specific hours each week during which the Contractor shall be reachable by phone or e-mail during the normal OTS business hours specified above.  Qualifications:  The Contractor should:  - Possess a detailed understanding of the complexities of migrating Treasury bureaus' proprietary payroll and HR processing systems to the Treasury Human Resources Line of Business (HRLoB) platform, based on having assumed a significant leadership role in at least one such migration;  - Have extensive experience collaborating with Treasury HR Connect and National Finance Center management and technical staff on complex data and system interoperability issues;  - Have a broad range of experience with the unique payroll and HR processing needs of non-appropriated Treasury bureaus that support significant mobile/traveling workforces; and - Demonstrate in-depth experience in resolving problems related to automated human resources systems that are based on multiple, interoperating application components and complex inter-system data flows.  The OTS intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  A purchase order  will be awarded after determining that it is the most advantageous means of satisfying OTS's needs.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, all quotes received with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bonafide capacity to meet the requirement received by 2:00PM EST, 3/20/08 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The equipment listed above is required to replace existing STonegate appliances that have reached the end of their life cycle for both hardware and software support. The firewalls will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's mission critical operating environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>To All Potential Offerors on MDA's MIDAESS,

Lt General Trey Obering, MDA's Director has selected Terry Little as the interim MiDAESS Program Manager (PM).  He is leading the effort to establish the MiDAESS requirements and will continue until there is a permanent manager. Terry intends to communicate the progress of the MiDAESS acquisition to industry on approximately a bi-weekly basis.

Previous FBO announcements and communications have alluded to a draft RFP release in 2007. That is not going to happen. Our current schedule anticipates a release in January 2008. The draft RFP will describe our anticipated total requirements for all functional areas, but will not be fully detailed. There will be enough definition for potential offerors to have a picture of the total scope of the MiDAESS effort, however.  

The draft RFP will include the proposed NAICS codes  for the various areas as well as potential set asides for small and/or disadvantaged business.  Whatever rumors you may have already heard about these set-asides are not true; we have made no decisions about this - not even tentative ones.

We will provide, in the draft, proposed verbiage for Sections L and M as well as the Section H clauses. Past performance will be an important source selection factor.  We will also address Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI).  It is our intention to provide area RFPs with similar structures, CLINs and clauses.


This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     Interested offerors may registerat http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.     MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments.     It is the interested offerors responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.

<DESC>MiDAESS Update (4 December 2007)

We still intend to award the multiple MiDAESS contracts in phases. The awards will be by functional areas to align with our matrix organization. 
Examples of functional areas include the following: 
	Engineering 
	Quality, Safety and Mission Assurance 
	Acquisition management 
	Financial management 
	Administrative 
	Etc 

The winners in each of the functional areas will be supporting the MDA Headquarters in the National Capital Region as well as program office locations in Dahlgren VA, Huntsville AL, Los Angeles CA, Albuquerque NM, Colorado Springs CO and potentially others including overseas. We do not plan to award any location specific contracts unless we only need the support in one area. 

Each Functional Manager will decide how much of what kind of support needs to be where. We expect to realize efficiencies from MiDAESS that will allow us to reduce our overall A&AS headcount. We also expect to move specific support among offices within MDA as the work ebbs and flows. 

Work in each functional area will build up over time as existing contracts expire or reach option dates. We do not plan to terminate any existing contracts. 
We have yet to decide which functional areas will be in Phase I. However, we do intend to award the Phase I contracts before the beginning of FY 2009. Awarding the remaining contracts may require as much as two additional years. 

Where there will be a break in coverage, we will be either extending the current contracts or making sole source awards for a bridging period. 

We are planning to release a draft RFP in late January 2008. That draft will contain the objectives and work statements for all the functional areas as well as the NAICs codes and source selection criteria. 

Our intention is to prohibit exclusive teaming arrangements. 

The MiDAESS program office will be in the National Capital Region for the foreseeable future. That program office will administer all of the MiDAESS contracts, but the Contracting Officer Representative will work for the functional manager.  Our draft RFP anticipates four source selection areas: managerial, technical, past performance and cost/price. 

Our current plan is to have a substantial, formal performance monitoring effort on each of the MiDAESS contracts. Where we will be making multiple awards from the same Statement of Work, we will use past performance (with a consideration of cost/price) as the basis for awarding additional tasks within the work scope. 

I am not talking with any offerors now. Because of the number of offerors and my desire to keep everything balanced for everyone, our primary communications will be via the Fed Biz Ops and the PSC website. Everything will be on-the-table when we issue the draft RFP. We will consider every input. 

The PM intends to update PSC approximately bi-weekly. The next update will be after our in-process review with senior management (December 20). The one after will come in mid January.

Interested offerors may registerat http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.

<DESC>As part of the continuing market research for the MiDAESS acquisition, industry is requested to respond to the following questions:

1. For those companies who believe that we should use a NAICS of 541712 for our technical/engineering support instead of 541330: 
Please tell us why you think that (other than "because that is what we have done before").

2.  For those companies who told us to avoid the mistakes of some recent support service procurements: Please tell us what those mistakes were.

3.  For those companies who said that we should put "teeth" into our small business contracting goals: Tell us what sorts of things would constitute "teeth".

4.  For those companies who intend to be part of a multi-company competing team: Please tell us the impact if we prohibited guaranteed work share for any team member.

5.  For all companies who intend to participate:  All companies winning a MIDAESS contract will get some minimum amount of work starting with contract award.  After award, where there are multiple awards, we want to adjust future work (up or down) based in large part on past performance. The adjustment process could, over time, result in one of the "winners" having little or no work. Tell us your opinion of this and provide a rationale.

Please send responses in MS Word 2003 format to MiDAESS@mda.mil.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE REPLACES ALL POSTED SYNOPSES TO DATE. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Superfund Remedation Technology and Innovation (OSRTI) has a requirement for Multi-Level Multi-Matrix Organic Sample Analysis. This requirement will provide a contractual framework for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for determining the presence and concentration of specified Inorganic Sample Analyses. This acquisition will be partially set aside for small business concerns.  This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA CLP analytical methods for the isolation, detection, quantitative measurement, and reporting of 23 metals (including mercury) and cyanide target analytes in water/aqueous, soil/sediment/wipes, and air environmental samples. The labs must have the capability to analyze samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA), and colorimetric measurement of cyanide. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380.  The USEPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a three month base period and two 12-month option periods to meet the USEPA's sample analyses need of approximately 70,000 units per year. Detailed information on the analytical requirements is provided via the Inorganic (ILM05.4) Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated exhibits/appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/ilm5.htm). The ILM SOW is a protocol that will define the inorganic methods and procedures accepted by the CLP. Offerors will be evaluated on factors which include Past Performance, Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Sample, Contract Compliance Screening Audit, Quality Assurance Plan, and Pre-Award Onsite Laboratory Audit. Offerors will be required to request Pre-Award Performance Evaluation Samples from the Contracting Officer by the date specified in the solicitation.  Laboratories interested in responding to the upcoming solicitation will be permitted access to the EPA web based Contract Compliance Screening (CCS) system. This system is designed to allow laboratories to self review electronic data files they have generated, as defined in the ILM05.4 Statement of Work (SOW).  While technical support on the use of this system may be provided by the supporting EPA contractor to approved users, the EPA contractor will not assist the non-CLP laboratories in identifying/correcting problems with their specific electronic submissions. Potential offerors are encouraged to begin development/testing of the required electronic files prior to release of the final solicitation. Access to the web CCS system may be requested through Michael S. Johnson at johnson.michaels@epa.gov or John Nebelsick at nebelsick.john@epa.gov. Requestors should provide their Laboratory Name, Requestor's Name, Laboratory (requestor) Address, Phone Number, and e-mail address. In an effort to streamline the procurement process and to utilize electronic communications to the maximum extent possible, the solicitation, amendments, and other related items for this procurement will be posted at this website: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/0810532/index.htm with notice posted on fedbizopps.com. Solicitation PR-HQ-08-10532 will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about March 27, 2008 and will close on or about May 2, 2008. Interested offerors are required to download the RFP and all related documents from this website. No printed copies of the RFP will be available. A draft version of the RFP is currently available at the website. All questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to Wendy Rizzo, Contract Specialist, at rizzo.wendy@epa.gov. NOTE: NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Question #1: 
I am very interested in responding to USTDA solicitation RFQ-CO2008210008 Definitional Mission: for Morocco - Information and Communications Technology Sector. I have searched the USTDA website for proposal format information as well as the RFQ, but I cannot find any information on what must be included in the actual proposal other than my proposed budget. I also searched for a proposal technical format and could not find one. I am aware that the Final Report format is covered in detail in the RFQ, and a Scope of Work is presented, but I am looking for the section L type of information typically found in an RFP/RFQ that instructs offerors on page limits, content, etc.


Answer to Question #1:
USTDA provided quotation instructions on FedBizOpps in the synopsis along with the solicitation attachment.  Evaluation criteria, page criteria and other applicable information are provided.

Vendors are reminded that certain notification software for FedBizOpps does not present all documents and attachments.  Vendors should always go to www.fbo.gov and confirm that all required information was presented in the original notice.  A further note, amendments to solicitations are often not caught by notification software therefore confirming directly on www.fbo.gov is the best solution for obtaining all needed information.

Question #2:
2.	These two RFQs were previously combined under single RFQ-CO210008210006, initially posted on Feb.1st, 2008, modified on Feb. 5th, 2008 and cancelled on Feb.27th, 2008.  Can you share the reason(s) for which these two DMs were separated?
Answer to Question #2:
The Government has determined that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to have the requirements be combined.


Question #3:
3.	With regard to the current Solicitations RFQ-CO2008210008 (Morocco) and CO2008210009 (Egypt):

a.	The Annex VII, titled Project Profiles/Background Information in each case states that the DM Contractor will be required to travel to each country without stating which city.  
i.	Can one assume the target cities are Rabat, Morocco and Cairo, Egypt?
ii.	If USTDA is unable to specify the destination cities, would it be acceptable for a response to indicate an assumption together with the condition that if any change thereto requested by USTDA will be at additional charge to cover incremental T&L if any?
b.	In the specific case of RFQ- CO2008210009 (Egypt), there appears to be a "typo" in Annex VII (page Annex VII ? 1), Paragraph 5, Line 6 which reads
"least five ten business days in there to evaluate and identify opportunities, and prepare".

It should probably read "ten full business days in Egypt to evaluate and identify opportunities, and prepare" and state the destination city in Egypt if at all possible.

Answer to Question #3:
a.	No specific cities have been indicated within Egypt or Morocco.  The DM Contractor is responsible for identifying specific locations based on research and in country contacts.  The DM Contractor is expected to visit cities where prospective projects may be found and where meetings are necessary.  
b.	The text should read ?five to ten days.?

<SUBJECT>99 -- USAF Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling Pilot Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FFS-AR-XR001
<RESPDATE>032808
<ARCHDATE>04122008

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.

Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this RFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive".  Data submitted in response to this RFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy for any fee-for-service aerial refueling demonstration program.  It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings.  Respondents are further advised that the government's analysis of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel.  If you do not wish your information disclosed to the government's support contractors, or require non-disclosure agreements be established with them prior to their being granted access to your information, your data must be marked accordingly.    

Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy, a maximum of fifty pages in length, and must be received by 28 March 2008.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

The Government extends an invitation to potential prime contractors for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling pilot program to present capabilities briefings in person the week of 14 April 2008.  These face-to-face sessions will be limited to two hours each and will be conducted at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.  Firms interested in scheduling a face-to-face session should contact the above point of contact for available times.  The government will not be able to provide industry with information on any future Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling request for proposal during these sessions as more detailed requirements documents do not yet exist.

[Modification 1 change - amended page limit on responses set forth in item #20; eliminated Ms. Krabacher as a POC.]

[Modification 2 change - reduced Industry Day face-to-face sessions to one hour per firm.]

[Modification 3 change - added clarification on the submission of "proprietary" data and access by government support contractor personnel.]

<CONTACT>Marsha K Harrington-Evans Contracting Officer 919-956-5541
<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: QUESTION:  In reading the request it is stated a vehicle: 3 "14-PASSENGER MINIMUM VEHICLES" TO BE PROVIDED.  Regarding this vehicle:  Does the contract have a preference or further specification? Does it distinguish between a "van" (single rear wheels),  or a shuttle bus/minibus (dual rear wheels)?   ANSWER:  The Government does not have a preference between single rear wheels and dual rear wheels. Reason for or logic behind question: We offer both types of vehicles: 14 psg VANS, and 14 psg minibuses. The minibuses have dual rear wheels and many of our government contracts have required us to cease using the more traditional 14 psg van (14 passengers + a driver) because the United States DOT has declared them unsafe for more than 6 passengers and illegal to be used for transporting students. Will this concern and federal government safety issue have a bearing on this contract? ANSWER:  Yes.  This matter will be further researched which may result in bilateral modification of the resulting contract.   QUESTION:  We are able to offer 14 psg vans or 14 psg minibuses--we just need to know if this is an issue or concern and if there is a preference for a van or a minibus? ANSWER:  The Government does not have a preference so long as the vehicle can transport at least 14 passengers.   QUESTION:  When the specification calls for a "14-PASSENGER MINIMUM" is there a desire or thought that a higher capacity vehicle would be better i.e. 20-25 psg, etc? ANSWER:  No, the Government does not have an interest in a 20-25 person vehicle.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

The General Services Administration (GSA) is currently seeking potential contractors to provide web based building safety plans and related on-line occupant training.  This training would be implemented in high rise buildings in downtown Chicago.

GSA has Occupant Emergency Plans for each of its facilities but does not have a web based application to house the program and provide occupant training.  The Occupant Emergency Plan includes responses to physical threats, medical emergencies, power outages, fire, and other severe weather/natural disasters.   Some of the functions of this system are to include:  

o	Training new/current occupants in the building about:
o	Escape routes
o	Customized directions on how to escape the building (based on occupant location)
o	Closest stairwells (based on occupant location)
o	The ability to use elevators in emergencies
o	Safety systems and equipment
o	Designated safe locations
o	Specific plans designed for the physically disabled and other handicap occupants.
o	Keeping accurate count of all occupants in the building by constant additions or deletions.
o	Allow for a website to train employees that has lectures/lessons and quizzes/tests for certificate purposes.
o	Preparing Emergency Response Personnel, Property Managers, Fire/Life Safety Staff and other designated staff.
o	Maintaining a current database in which all designated people are listed with contact information
o	Duties, responsibilities, and procedures involved with each position involved in an emergency
o	Knowing how to assist the physically disabled and other handicap occupants.
o	Establishing standards in the event of an emergency
o	Allowing access to up-to-date information on current statuses of the building and be able to print results of such information
o	Electronic drawings/diagrams of building must be available electronically
o	Electronic drawings/diagrams must show where all utilities are located, all switches, all cut-off valves and other important equipment are in an emergency.

This system must also be capable of supporting detailed information for first responders including graphics of the buildings mechanical and control points.  This system would provide valuable information on the location and status of building HVAC, electrical plumbing, and fire suppression systems, utility shutoffs etc.  

Please respond to this RFI by notating that your company can provide the minimum requirements outlined as well as some information such as a brief proposal and options as to how these requirements can be met.

<DESC>1.  SCOPE

a. The U.S. Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT), Systems Management Division, at Randolph AFB, TX, seeks qualified sources capable of providing a full range of basic aircraft training services to include but not be limited to ground-based academics, simulator, and actual flight instruction applicable to 	Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) procedures that will culminate in an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliant commercial multi-engine instrument rating.  The training is desired to be presented in a ?military style? disciplined training program.  Training may be required on a one time basis to support the reconstruction of the Afghan National Army Air Corps (ANAAC).  This effort can be expected to consist of instructing a cadre of 36 personnel.  All training will take place in the continental United States and require flight instructors that are familiar with military oriented training (previous military flight training experience is highly desired), and capable of flight operations in a twin-engine, retractable gear aircraft with variable pitch propellers. 

b.  To simplify and speed-up the procurement process for acquiring training and related services, it is essential that respondents be willing/able to act as a single point integrator for all required training services.  The full range of training personnel (academic, simulator, and flight) are the responsibility of the respondent and will be either directly sourced internally or by sub-contract with other vendors for services not directly under their control.

c.  Unless otherwise specified, assume all instruction and technical information will be presented at the unclassified level delivered under the auspices of the U.S. Security Assistance Training Program.  All international military students will be English qualified at an ECL level of 70 or greater prior to entering training.  Students will already have previous aircraft experience and will be pilot rated.         

d.  All required training staff, instructional services, materials, and related student support services (billeting in close proximity to the training facility, meals, and transportation to/from training facility and billeting) will be provided by the respondent at a location within the continental US.   Training aircraft, simulators, and facilities will be provided by the respondent organization.  Training aircraft will be twin engine, variable pitch propeller, and retractable gear light trainer/cargo type aircraft similar to the Piper Seminole or Seneca.  The training will culminate in an ICAO and FAA compliant commercial multi-engine instrument rating and will consist of ground training, simulator training and at least 40 hours of flight instruction and total length of training should not exceed 90 days.   

 e.    All student support services to include: transportation to/from the airport, transportation to/from billeting and the training facility, lodging in close proximity to the training facility, and meals will be provided by the respondent organization. The respondent may be required to assist through a travel agency, the coordination, itineraries, and tickets for travel from/to Afghanistan for each student.  The service provider should expect training to begin no earlier than 01 September 2008 and no later than 01 October 2008.  Up to 36 students will require training during a 12 month period and the service provider should be prepared for a maximum student load of 12 students at any one time in different phases of training.  

	f.   The objective of specified IFR training is to rebuild the ANAAC with pilots transitioning into various fixed and rotary wing aircraft such that they attain the necessary skills for safe and competent operation within an IFR environment.  This includes required ground school, flight simulator, and flying instruction.  Contractor format training courseware may be utilized if equivalent to military training standards (as determined by AFSAT).   Delivered training must provide students the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and perform specified IFR flight duties in their assigned aircraft.  The contractor will verify and document student gained knowledge and skills through testing and exercises.   

	g. Training is expected to consist of classroom lecture/discussion sessions, practical exercises using appropriate training devices and/or training aids, and inflight instructional training in the actual aircraft.  Flight training devices (simulators), when/where available, will be used to enhance ground academics and serve as a transition from ground training to the flight training phase.  The fidelity of the flight training device will replicate the training systems and flying characteristics with a sufficient level necessary to achieve the training objective.  

2.  REQUIRED RESPONSE INFORMATION

	a. Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested, qualified, capable sources with proven and/or high confidence ability to deliver and support a complete IFR training program using provided training assets.

	b. Interested parties who believe they have the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities should submit technical capabilities in writing.  Responses are asked to include sufficient detail to illustrate ability to support required training and define as specifically as possible, the approach expected to be employed to deliver this training and achieve the desired results.    

	c. Details with respect to past experience in the provision of similar flight training or related air services contracts are a firm requirement for any response and should be sufficiently detailed so as to illustrate their relative level of scope.  Include a description of the services provided, customer(s), location(s), period(s) of performance, and customer contact information we may use to verify such experience.     

      d. Respondent(s) are encouraged to identify any aspects of this training effort that are considered especially high risk or unlikely to be supportable, as currently defined.  This information, along with any constructive work-arounds or alternative training concepts that may be suggested, will help determine the overall feasibility of sourcing this training via commercial means.

<DESC>OBJECTIVE AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT

The Office of Infrastructure and Engineering in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT/I&E) will have technical management and responsibility for this Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The purpose of this Infrastructure Sector IQC is to provide ready access to short and long-term professional technical assistance and capacity building in the areas of energy, information and communications technology (ICT), roads and transport, water and urban issues to USAID Washington and USAID missions abroad in countries that are assisted by USAID.  The tasks awarded under this contract will support USAID?s objective of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in USAID-assisted countries.

This contract shall complement and reinforce the activities of the I&E Office, other USAID Washington Pillar/Technical Bureaus, USAID Regional Bureaus, and USAID Regional and Bilateral Missions.  The contractor shall provide professional services and experienced personnel with the specific skills sets required in IQC Task Orders.  

The Infrastructure Sector IQC will address the following sectors:

A.	Energy 

Expanding access to modern energy services empowers people to take a major step out of poverty into a better future.  Energy increases economic growth, employment opportunities, private sector investment, and competitiveness; strengthens democracy and fosters political stability through improved transparency and communication; enhances national security; improves quality of life by enabling better health care, education, and access to clean water; and protects the environment and public health.  Unfortunately, more than 2 billion people, or one-third of the world?s population, have no access to electricity or other modern forms of energy.  Expanding access to safe, affordable, efficient, reliable and clean energy to power economic and social development is the cornerstone of USAID?s energy mission.

B.	Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

Information and communications technology (ICT) has become a powerful tool in the fight against world poverty, providing developing countries with an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals, such as poverty reduction, basic health care, economic growth and education, far more effectively than before.  ICT depends on affordable access to telecommunications networks.  These include Internet (IP) networks as well as mobile phone networks, the latter increasingly being used for data applications as well as voice communications.  These networks can be used by the private sector, civil society and governments themselves.  Governments use ICT for e-government applications to improve the quality of services to citizens and businesses.

C.	Roads and Transport

In many countries, roads and highways provide the dominant mode of land transport and play a vital role in improving people?s lives and in contributing to national economic growth.  They often carry more than 80 percent of passenger-km and over 50 percent of freight ton-km in a country.  Consequently, roads and highways form the backbone to the economy and provide essential links to the vast local and community (rural) road networks.  Sea and air ports also provide important entry ways for the movement of goods and people.

D.	Water and Sanitation

Water is essential to life, and because over one billion people still lack access to safe water and nearly two billion lack safe sanitation, more than three million people die every year from avoidable water-related disease. Water security is a rapidly growing issue.  The poor are particularly vulnerable when water is either unclean or in short supply.  At the same time, water is a key development ingredient that impacts on a variety of factors that sustain and enhance life, as well as serving as a major input for industrial production (e.g., food processing). 

E.	Urban Management

Over 90 per cent of the world's population growth in the coming two decades will occur in developing cities - most of it in urban slums.  In the absence of sound governance and management practices, rapid urbanization will harm the environment.  It will also create life threatening water shortages, deplete valuable natural resources, strangle economic growth, widen income disparities and increase the spread of disease. However, well-managed cities can become engines of economic growth, enhance national prosperity, and increase both domestic harmony and international goodwill.  In a global and increasingly urbanized world, cities play a key role in building a better future.  Cities and local governments need the skills and tools to manage their resources effectively, deliver critical urban services, partner with the private sector, and foster economic growth for the betterment of their citizens.

<DESC>The CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center  Washington seeks sources for Pressure Plate Detection Systems.  This survey will be managed by the Armys Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Ft. Belvoir, VA. in support of the Joint IED Defeat  Organization (JIEDDO).  Results of this survey will be provided to other U.S. Government agencies as necessary. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking detection technolo gies that are capable of protecting our Coalition and Partner Nation soldiers from Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) threats that are triggered by pressure plates.  Technically mature (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or higher) detection systems are be ing sought which have capability to provide detection performance at standoff ranges required by Coalition and Partner Nation military forces that conduct route clearance missions.  The detection systems will be expected to be able to detect a variety of t arget surrogates which are buried on improved/unimproved roads at shallow depths (less than 8 cm) to include:  <BR><BR>1.  Multiple contact-switch wire made with lamp cord (aluminum or copper) and pressure switch contacts (aluminum or copper) at six-inch i ntervals (i.e. Christmas Tree Lights).<BR><BR>2.

The Southeast Region, TRBO Reg. 3 and 4,a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,and U.S.Coast Guard Medical Treatment Faciliti es, MTF,in the states of Alabama,  Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina,Tennessee, and affiliated MTF in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras,  and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation,RFRIAQ,for the standardization of  Pre-Filled Flush Syringes.   <BR>The primary objective of this program is to st and ardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or sources, at the best possible price. I t is also intended that st and ardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center, FT Gordon, GA; Winn Army Community Hospital,  FT Stewart, GA; Martin Army Commuity Hospital, FT Benning, GA; Naval Hospital Jacksonville, NAS Jacksonville, FL; 96th Medical Group, Eglin AFB, FL; Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, FL; Naval Hospital Beaufort, Beaufort, SC; 81st Medical Group, Keesle r AFB, MS;  and  the 6th Medical Group, MacDill AFB, FL.  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical and Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, DSCP, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to parti cipate, your company must have a Distribution  and  Pricing Agreement, DAPA, and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to a llow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https: and dmmonline.dscp.dla.m il.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement, RIA, will be for a base period of two year, 24 months, from date of selection with three 12-month option periods, not to exceed 5 years. Anticipated selection date is July 2008.  The evaluation will be bas ed on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical and Company  and  Clinical and Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results b ecome more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be based on the best-value, lowest-overall cost alternative quoted.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. Point of Contact: Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil, 706-787-2019,<BR>A.  Products  and  Performance Required.  <BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Pre-Filled Flush Syringes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated ann ual dollar requirement of $103,253.65.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical and Company Criteria below.<BR>At the request of t he Southeast Regional MTF, vendors will provide on-site support  and  in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information,  and  itemization of the br and s, types  and  packaging information of the prod ucts supplied by the vendor.<BR>B. Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this st and ardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical and company criteria  and , 1. Company name  and  address,  2. POC: Name  and  Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address, to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date and time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no ch arge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security,etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submiss ion, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time,should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do  not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing, per the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the st and ardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors  and  the Region should be digitally si gned by the issuer.  <BR>C. Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board, TPRB, is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the South east Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.The Region intends to evaluate price quotes  and  select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor best product matches for the products or product li nes requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor best responses to all technical  and  and or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendo r DAPA pricing, based on committed volume of 80 percent  of the total requirements of the MTF in the Region.  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-sele ction is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I  Technical and Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond  to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses  and  required documentation to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical and company criteria stated below.  All technic al and company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team, CPT, to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical and company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria wil l be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical and performance evaluation.  a. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical and company criteria is defined as follows: 1. based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products  and  and or services submitted meet the medical st and ards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 2. the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentatio n of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical and company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific st and ard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR>The following Technical and Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this st and ardization initiative:     <BR>1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line, needle-l ess, pre-filled normal saline IV flush syringes, available in various syringe diameters, with various fill volume.  A complete line of product is defined as the  MTF requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical and Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month,  and  at least one unit per order.  <BR>a. At a minimum, thi s includes needle-less pre-filled normal saline IV flush syringes, available in various syringe diameters of 3ml, 5ml, 10ml, with fill volumes of 3ml, 5ml,  and  10ml.  <BR>b. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied, catalog, etc.,  and  pro duct literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes  and  styles listed above. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>c. Vendors  MUST provide supporting documentation that all Pre-Filled Flush Syringes that are manufactured  and  and or distributed are FDA approved for use in all clinical settings,  and  provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <B R>2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Pre-Filled Flush Syringes product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. Vendors that do not have a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR>3. Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the pr ime vendor, currently; the Southeast Region prime vendor is Owens  and  Minor, for distribution in the Southeast Region.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.  Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV w ill be disqualified in Phase I.   <BR>4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this st and ardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are a vailable, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, i n response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5. Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient pro duct implementation services  and  customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number,and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Pre-Filled Flush Syringes products, including dates, duration, cause,  and  resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information deeme d relevant, i.e., positive resolutions, etc, in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7. V endor MUST provide Pre-Filled Flush Syringes that are latex safe and free.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.<BR>8. Vendor products MUST be preservative free.  Provide documentation with initial submittal.<BR>9. Vendor products MUST be compatible with all needle-less IV access systems.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submittal.<BR>Phase II  Clinical and Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical and company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf o f the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTF for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTF  and  will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notificat ion to complete the delivery.  Literature  and  product samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM EST, on the, 14th, calendar day after the notic e to ship. Vendors failing to deliver the literature  and  product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this st and ardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items,  and  date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date  and  individual who signed for literature  and  product sample sets. Specific MTF will evaluate the evaluate the vendor product sample sets against the clinical and performance crite ria in a non-clinical, non-patient care, setting using a Likert scale format with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: 1-not acceptable, 2-minimally acceptable, 3-acceptable, 4-most acceptable  and  5-highly acceptable.  All clinical an d performance criteria are equally weighted.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for st and ardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this st and ardization initiati ve -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores, i.e., a gap between vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in de termining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable,  and  will be disqualified from further consideration for this st and ardization initiative.To determi ne acceptability, a Clinical Product Team, CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical, non-p atient care, setting. The following Clinical and Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this st and ardization initiative:  <BR>a. Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR>b. Syringe plunger advances smo othly when steady  and  continuous pressure is applied.  <BR>i. Clinicians require that the pre-filled syringe plunger allow for a gentle, controlled injection of flush solution which maintains patency of IV access device  and  minimizes patient discomfort  during IV access flush procedures.	<BR>ii. This criterion will be evaluated by, five trials in a non-clinical, non-patient care, setting by discharging syringe contents into an open container.<BR>iii. While applying steady  and  continuous pressure on pre -filled flush syringe plunger, the evaluator will assess any resistance felt in the thumb  and  and or fingers, of h and  holding syringe, as well as visually assessing that syringe contents advance smoothly  and  continuously.<BR>c. Syringe contents easil y visible when viewed through syringe barrel.<BR>i. The Pre-Filled Flush syringe contents are easily visible when viewed through syringe barrel allowing the end-user to visualize any foreign matter that may be inside syringe barrel.<BR>ii. This criterion w ill be evaluated by, five trials in a non-clinical setting.<BR>iii. Prior to discharging the contents of the Pre-Filled flush Syringe, the evaluator will look at the syringe barrel, assuring that the contents can be visualized.<BR>d. Syringe has a graduate d scale of measured markings that are clearly visible on Syringe barrel.<BR>i. The clearly visible graduated scale of measured markings on the Pre-Filled Flush Syringe barrel allow the end-user to safely identify  and  administer the prescribed quantity of  flush solution.<BR>ii. This criterion will be evaluated by, five trials in a non-clinical setting.<BR>iii. Prior to discharging the contents of the Pre-Filled Flush Syringe, the evaluator will visually inspect the syringe barrel, assuring there is a gradu ated scale of measured markings printed on the side of the syringe barrel.<BR>e. Syringe contents are identified by clearly printed labeling on syringe barrel, example: 0.9 percent , Sodium Chloride.<BR>i. Pre-Filled Flush syringe contents will be identified by a clearly printed label on the syringe barrel allowing the end-user to administer the appropriate product when flushing IV access devices.<BR>ii. This cri terion will be evaluated by, five trials in a non-clinical setting.<BR>iii. Prior to discharging the contents of the Pre-Filled Flush syringe, the evaluator will visually inspect the syringe barrel assuring there is clearly printed labeling identifying the  contents of the syringe.<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical and performance evaluation is completed  and  analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold, -- at o r near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores, i.e., a gap between vendors average scores, as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes, as well as product cross-reference data, based o n committed volume of 80 percent  of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring bel ow the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable,  and  will be disqualified from further consideration for this st and ardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified fr om further consideration and  participation.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA pri ce.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this st and ardization initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes  and  select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the  right to conduct discussions  and  request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient comp etition among vendors.<BR>Clinical and performance  and  technical and company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical and Company  and  Clinical and Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical  and  clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government  and  will be based on a committed volume for a base per iod of two year, 24 months, from date of selection with three 12-month option periods not to exceed 5 years.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1. Impact of RIA prices on the Region. Post-St and ardization Costs.  This rep resents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization  and  includes the vendor products,  and  the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  2. Potential Cost  Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution  and  Pricing Agreement, DAPA, price  and  multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  3. Impact of Unmatched Lines. The unmatched  lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor. Those items t hat are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>4. Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that  must be h and led per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this st and ardization initiative.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region ,TRBO Reg. 3 & 4,, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medica l Treatment Facilities ,MTFs, in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation, RFRIAQ, fo r the standardization of Sterile Surgical Gloves.    <BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source,s, at the  best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include Eisenhower Army Medical Center, FT Gordon, GA; Winn Army Community Hospital, FT Stewart, GA; Martin Army Community Hospital, FT Benning, GA; Naval Hospital Jacksonville, NAS Jacksonville, FL; 96th Medical Group, Eglin AFB, FL; Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, FL; Naval Hospital Beaufort, Beaufort, SC; 81st Medical Group, Keesler A FB, MS; and the 6th Medical Group, MacDill AFB, FL.  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia ,DSCP,, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement ,DAPA, and MUST have a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP  Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil .<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement ,RIA, will be for a base period of two ,2, years, 24 months, from date of selection with three, 3, 12-month,  option-periods, not to exceed a total of 5 years.  Anticipated TPRB selection date is November 200 8.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical e valuation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be based on the best value, lowest overall cost alternative quoted.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  <BR>Point of Contact Ginny Slayton, ,706, 787-2 019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Sterile Surgical Gloves, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines identified in the complete produ ct line, Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.

Due to the potential for ema il to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm  receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR>D.  Evaluation Criteria.  <B R>The Tri-Service Product Review Board, TPRB, is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for thi s initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor  best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes sho uld contain the vendor  best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor  best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor  DAPA pricing ,based on committed volume of 80% of the t otal requirements of the MTFs in the Region.  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the numbe r of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required doc umentation to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team, CPT, to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a. In general, acceptability   for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1. based on the vendor  responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of c are of the community, applicable to such products or services; 2. the vendor  information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company crite ria will require an additional, more-specific definition of   technical acceptability.    The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR>The following Technical/Company E valuation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:    <BR>1.  Vendor MUST provide a complete product line of Sterile Surgical Gloves.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTF  requirements for usage items in the product  line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one  unit per order.<BR>a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Sterile Surgical Gloves in various styles including powder, powder free, latex, latex free, synthetic, available in both smooth and textured finishes.  Gloves in this product line will be available in a variety of thicknesses, super-sensitive to orthopedic, to accommodate various needs for sensitivity.  The sizes for all styles above include 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in a ll sizes and styles listed.   <BR>b. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied, catalog, etc., and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles list ed above. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>c. Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all Sterile Surgical Gloves manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved for use in clinical se ttings, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <BR>2.  Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Sterile Surgical Gloves product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. Vendors without a DAPA number will be di squalified in Phase I.  <BR>3.  Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor, PV, currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor, for distribution in the Southeast Region. Note that <BR>vendors whose products are not available through the regio nal PV will be disqualified., Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.   <BR>4.  Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a di scount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this  standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.  Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with  initial submittal.  <BR>6.  Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Sterile Surgical Gloves, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an op portunity to provide additional information deemed relevant ,i.e., positive resolutions, etc, in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contac t information in response to this question.<BR>7.  Vendor  product MUST meet the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses ,AORN, standards for the materials to be resistant to penetration by blood and other body fluids.  Vendors MUST provide document ation with initial submittal. ,Vendors who do not meet AORN standards will be disqualified in Phase I. <BR>8.  Vendor  products MUST meet the American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM,  standards numbers D5151, D6124, and D3577 for Sterile Surgical Gloves.  Vendors MUST provide documentation with initial submittal. Vendors who do not meet the ASTM standards will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteri a, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request literature and product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation. <BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the literature and samples to the designated MTFs.  Literature and]samples must be received at the enclosed address, by COB, 5:00 PM EST, fourteen calendar days after the issue  date of the notice to supply samples.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the q uantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.<BR>1.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor  product sample sets against the<BR>clin ical/performance criteria in a non-clinical ,non-patient care, setting using a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: 1-not acceptable, 2-minimally acceptable, 3-acceptable, 4-most acceptable and 5-highly acceptable.  All  clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT wil l determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any  break  in vendors average scores, i.e., a gap between vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how c losely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified f rom further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team,CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  Th e CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical, non-patient care, setting.   <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Th reshold:  3.0 <BR>1. Glove dons easily when hand is damp indicating sufficient internal lubricant <BR>coating of glove is present. <BR>a. The more easily the Surgical glove can be donned will decrease the <BR>potential for contamination of the sterile glov e, by the clinician, which renders 	 	    the glove unusable in a sterile, surgical setting.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 9 trials in a non-clinical ,non-patient care,      setting.<BR>c. While donning the surgical glove, the evaluator will as sess any difficulties <BR> related to the resistance of the glove material against the hand and/or fingers 	<BR>and/or thumb entering the surgical glove.<BR>2. Glove does not tear when being donned or removed from hand thus maintaining a <BR> sustained pro tective barrier.<BR>a. The glove donning and removal periods are times when the surgical gloves are 	  subject to an increased amount of stress ,stretching, pulling and twisting,.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 9 trials in a non-clinical ,non-pa tient care, <BR>setting.<BR>c. During and after the donning and removal periods, the evaluator will visually  	 <BR>inspect the surgical glove for evidence of tearing.<BR>3. Glove fits securely around wrist to remain in position throughout intended use,      maintaining a sustained protective barrier.<BR>a. If the surgical Glove does not fit securely around the wearer  wrist, a <BR>complete and sustained protective barrier is not created.  The lack of protective  <BR>barrier increases the potential for bo th the clinician and patient to be 	<BR>contaminated by pathogens.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 9 trials in a non-clinical ,non-patient care, <BR>s etting.<BR>c. While wearing the surgical gloves, the evaluator will visually inspect and feel <BR>the glove to judge the integrity of its fit around the evaluator  wrist. <BR>4. Glove allows wearer to experience adequate tactile sensation to maintain a sen sation of touch throughout the procedure.<BR>a. If, while wearing the surgical glove, clinicians do not experience adequate  <BR>tactile sensation their ability to perform clinical procedures will be   <BR>compromised. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluat ed by 9 trials in a non-clinical ,non-patient care, <BR>setting.<BR>c. While wearing the surgical glove, the evaluator will assess tactile sensation by 	 <BR>attempting tasks involving his/her hands and comparing the tactile sensitivity to  <BR>that experi enced when performing those tasks without surgical gloves.  <BR>5. Glove does not tear during expected regular use, therefore maintaining a sustained protective barrier. ,Average regular use is 4 hours,<BR>a. A surgical glove must be capable of maintaining  its integrity for an anticipated            	    length of time.  A surgical glove that tears unexpectedly during regular use 	<BR>compromises the sterile protective barrier provided for the clinician and the  <BR>patient.<BR>b. This criterion will be eva luated by 9 trials in a non-clinical ,non-patient care, <BR>setting.<BR>c. After wearing the surgical glove to perform clinical tasks the evaluator will 	  	    visually inspect the glove for tears.<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clini cal/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold,-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any  break  in vendors average scores, i.e., a gap between vendors average scores, as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered ne ar the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration  for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timefram e or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS p rices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quo tes and select a vendor without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Regi on may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performanc e evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to th e government and will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two year, 24 months, from date of selection with three 12-month option periods, not to  exceed 5 years.  <BR>The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1. Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  ,Post-Standardization Costs,.  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includ es the vendor  products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  2. Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distributi on and Pricing Agreement, DAPA, price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix. 3. Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator c annot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  4. Consideration of SKUs by eac h vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Assistance Services for the Office of Rural Health Policy
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the National
Rural Health Association (NRHA), Kansas City, Missouri.  This contract directly supports the Legislative Authorization of the Offiice of Rural Health Policy(ORHP) as created by Section 711 of the Social Security Act .The purpose of this contract is to purchase a broad range of Services designed to strengthen ORHP?s support of rural communities. Through this contract ORHP will:
 
- Provide technical assistance to State Rural Health Associations and conduct skill  building workshops for these grassroots entities.

- Develop leadership capacity at the grassroots level.

- Gather information about the effects of implementation of Medicare and Medicaid 
   reforms on rural health access to services, providers, pharmacists and systems of care.


The NRHAis uniquely qualified to provide these services to ORHP.  NRHA is a nonprofit association composed of individual and organizational members who share a common interest in rural health. For the past 28 years, NRHA has provided a forum for the exchange and dissemination of ideas, information, research and methods to improve rural health. 

NRHA has a significant investment in confidential and proprietary information needed to fulfill this contract which is not known in the health care community in general or to the public.  For example, its members database includes over 11,000 rural providers, organizations and citizens across the health care sector.  Their membership is organized in a manner useful to ORHP.  It is divided into 9 rural constituency groups: community grassroots, clinical services, community-operated practices, frontier, hospital and community health systems, diverse underserved populations, research and education, rural health clinics and statewide health resources.  In addition to constituency groups, the members participate in 7 issue groups: rural health networks, leading the national quality effort, academic/community partnerships, rural pharmacy, rural public health, rural and frontier emergency medical services, universal access and Medicaid. 

NRHA is the only entity whose membership includes State Rural Health Associations and State Offices of Rural; as well as local health providers.  NRHA?s reputation and diversity and stringent membership will be essential to providing ORHP with meaningful information about the effect of health policies in rural communities and distinguishes it as a uniquely qualified organization.  Because it has a long history in serving rural communities, NRHA has the resources and ability to begin work on these tasks immediately. It is likely that a one(1) year contract with a base year and two(2) option years may result. Using any other vendor would significantly increase the costs, decrease the quality and delay the acquisition of these products. This justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (ii) A, ?it is likely that an award to any other service would result in-(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered 
 through competition.? This notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPSAL, TO IBIS ECOSYSTEM ASSOCIATES, FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN EVERGLADES ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND WETLANDS SCIENCE/ECOLOGY FOR THE EVERGLADES CERP MAP REVISION
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to negotiate and award a purchas e order on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to Ibis Ecosystem Associates, 92 Spruce Ct., Sapphire, NC 28774, to provide technical  Support for Refinement of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP)  including the Greater Everglades (GE) Module.  The Contractor is responsible for participating in the MAP revision process, which will be  directed by the Integrative Assessment Team (IAT).  Assistance will be provided to the IAT regarding Everglades restoration research and monitoring issues by attending meetings and preparing written summaries for the IAT and the Restoration Coordination a nd Verification (RECOVER) Assessment Team.  Preparation of the revision inputs will require the contractor to coordinate with and provide technical support to the RECOVER module leads, inter-agency scientists and other participants, and university resource s in addition to the RECOVER IAT.  The Contractors role at IAT meetings and MAP 2008 Workshops is to provide institutional knowledge about development of the MAP in 2004 and development of the GE Module as well as technical expertise on monitoring, assess ment, and adaptive management (AM).  The support will include providing scientific and technical expertise on revision of the GE MAP monitoring (i.e., further revision of hypothesis clusters, review and revision of monitoring components, advice about infor mation gaps, etc.) at GE Module Meetings.  The GE Module is being used as a Pilot Project for developing MAP 2008, and the process will be applied to other modules as the effort progresses.  The Contractor will also lead discussions/topic sessions at all m eetings/workshops.  Attendance at IAT Meetings, MAP 2008 Workshops, and GE/SE Module Meetings will be required, and assistance will be provided for development and review of specific sections of the MAP 2008.  In particular, assistance will be provided to the GE Module leads in developing revised GE sections in the MAP 2008; including providing technical and scientific expertise on the GE, applying the MAP 2008 strategy to monitoring components, providing expertise to cross-modular monitoring components, de veloping text portions for the GE section, and compiling the revised MAP 2008 GE section. For the system-wide section of MAP 2008, assistance will be provided for development and review of topics such as Interim Goals/Interim Targets, Adaptive Management, and Project-level Monitoring Plans (PLMPs).  Expertise will be applied in finalizing text for inclusion in MAP 2008, including addressing comments and providing responses and corrected sections as appropriate following RECOVER/RLG and Public Reviews of the  draft MAP 2008. Assistance will also be provided in the coordination of MAP 2008 and the 2009 System Status Report (SSR), providing input to the IAT and AT regarding linkages between the MAP 2008 and the 2009 SSR; including participation in the discussion s at the IAT and GE Module Meetings as well as providing comments on any IAT documents enumerating the details for the 2009 SSR (i.e., how the information will be presented) and function as compared to previous versions (i.e., 2007 SSR).<BR><BR>The technic al support for these evaluations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be provided by Ibis Ecosystem Associates.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541690 and the size standard is $6.5 Million.  The sole s ource determination is based upon the breadth of knowledge, skills, and expertise possessed by Mr. Steve Davis, sole proprietor of Ibis Ecosystem Associates.  M r. Davis is an expert in the field of Everglades ecosystem restoration and wetlands science/ecology.  Mr. Davis is an expert possessing a unique set of qualifications to support the ongoing MAP 2008 efforts and considered to be an extremely respected ecolo gist. Mr. Davis was a co-editor with John Ogden, SFWMD, of the seminal book on the Everglades published in 1994, which ushered in the restoration movement and set the stage for the Everglades Restudy. Additionally, Mr. Davis was one of the lead authors of the CEMs for the Greater Everglades ecosystem, as well as a participant in development of the MAP 2004, creation of the Assessment Guidance process, and drafting of initial SSRs. His ecological expertise, knowledge of the Everglades ecosystem, and institut ional knowledge regarding the process that produced the first MAP will be invaluable in assisting the AT with the complex process of revising the MAP. <BR><BR>An award to any other source would affect the U S Army Corps of Engineers ability to provide the technical information required, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  <BR><BR>	This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Equipment and Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State firewall infrastructure connectivity and security requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet. The equipment listed above is required to replace existing STonegate appliances that have reached the end of their life cycle for both hardware and software support. The firewalls will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's mission critical operating environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Section 5512 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Public Law 109-59, provides funding for the acceleration of TRANSIMS deployment, training on the use of TRANSIMS and development of new applications of TRANSIMS. The goal of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to support applied research and scientific study directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding to broaden the TRANSIMS user base and to provide for applications of TRANSIMS representing a diversity of populations, geographic regions and analytical methods.
Since multiple awards are possible and FHWA has an interest not only in the individual offers but also in the selected projects collectively meeting the goals of the BAA, the solicitation will be conducted in two phases. 

Phase 1 is an optional submission of a short white paper describing the proposed project and partnering arrangements. FHWA will provide feedback on the white paper, making recommendations for improvements to the proposed work. 

Phase 2 is the submission of technical, staffing and cost proposals as described in the subsequent sections. Offerors may choose not to submit white papers in Phase 1 and may choose to respond only to Phase 2.

A. BACKGROUND. The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is an agent-based travel simulation system designed to meet the State Department of Transportations? (DOTs') and Metropolitan Planning Organizations? (MPOs') need for higher fidelity transportation planning and emissions analyses.  Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits and impacts on different travel markets can be evaluated. Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems. TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods in its underlying concepts and structure. These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time; a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based microsimulator.

There are four primary modules: Population synthesizer, Activity generator, Route planner, and Traffic microsimulator. Using these components, a model may be constructed that estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a microsimulation of all persons, vehicles and resulting traffic on modeled transport systems in given study area.
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (www.lanl.gov) designed and developed the original TRANSIMS algorithms and software. The design for TRANSIMS is based on requirements in:
? the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Public Law (PL) 102-240), 
? the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (PL 105-178) as amended by the TEA 21 Restoration Act (PL 105-206), and 
? the Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101-549) Amendments. 

The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Federal Transit Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Other Solicitations

? This solicitation is conducted in parallel with the TRANSIMS Application Research BAA. These solicitations both support the TRANSIMS program.

B. CURRENT STATUS. TRANSIMS development has proceeded along several lines. These include development of application methods, data sets, and software.

Methods Development. The following methods have been used on multiple studies. Further documentation can be found at http://transims-opensource.org  and http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims.
? Network data synthesis: Methods for translating multimodal link-node databases for use in TRANSIMS have been developed and documented. These include insertion of GIS-based centerline files and estimating traffic control characteristics.
? Trip-based network simulation: Methods for translating regional trip tables into time-varying highway demand data; routing and simulating highway; equilibrating highway route flows; and calibration have been developed. Also referred to as ?Track 1? methods, this approach is currently recommended as the starting point for initiating a TRANSIMS study. These methods rely on trip processing and selection tools, the router, and the microsimulator.
? Household activity simulation: Quick response methods for generating household activities, schedules, and locations have been developed. Methods for routing and simulating of highway tours are under development. Methods for mode choice as well as for routing and simulating transit tours will begin development later in 2008.

Data Sets. Several data sets are available for research, development, and testing. These include notional grid and freeway data sets, validation data sets derived from the NGSIM program, and a demonstration data set based on Alexandria VA. These data sets may be browsed at http://transims.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/transims/version4/trunk/case_studies/. 

Software. The software and source code are made available under the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3. This license makes the source code open to the public and requires that any changes to the original code remain publicly available. The license permits use within other software without restriction. For further information see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php  
TRANSIMS is implemented as a toolbox. Over forty software tools have been developed based on the work in Portland and other studies. These include methods to convert node and link data into TRANSIMS format, estimate intersection signalization, and assist with data preparation and application. The TRANSIMS software is written primarily in C++. 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available for Linux and Windows. Support is available via documentation and forums.  The software and source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/. For more information on the software, forums, and supporting utilities, see http://transims-opensource.org/

C. OBJECTIVES. FHWA seeks to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, and seeks to develop new approaches, tools, and applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area. Prospective offerors will submit proposals that:
1. Increase deployment of TRANSIMS,
2. Broaden the TRANSIMS user base, and
3. Develop new applications of TRANSIMS. 

D. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS.  The scope of this announcement is intentionally broad to invite innovation and to provide the FHWA the flexibility to sponsor research which best addresses its objectives.  In keeping with FHWA?s desire for innovation and flexibility, the specific approach in the selected proposals will vary and will be negotiated.  
Any resulting contracts will contain appropriate federal agency clauses for the type of procurement vehicle awarded, including any requirements for compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as applicable.  Prior to award, the Offeror shall be required to submit ?Certifications and Representations.?  Data and reporting requirements will be negotiated with the firm(s) selected for award(s).  

The proposal submission shall be conducted in two phases:
1. an optional White Paper for FHWA review and comment (electronic submission); 
2. the final proposal (hard copy submission).

O.       EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.    The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance.  Technical and Management Plan are more important than Past Performance.  When combined these non-price evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, the greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted. Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter?s best terms. Technical and Management Plan:  The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm.  Each quoter should submit a staffing plan for achieving the SOO (providing a proper skill mix, experience, and required number of qualified personnel).  The quoter should identify key personnel for this project, and submit resumes for proposed key personnel.  The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing.  The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan. The Plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describe contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government. Past Performance:  The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.  Include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project; c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.  Price:     The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for all proposed labor categories for the base period and for each of the four option periods.     
The technical quote submission shall be limited to 10 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.). Past performance is limited to two one-sided pages.  The price proposal must reflect the hourly rate, hours, and extended price for each labor category, and an overall price for each Period of Performance.

P.       SUBMISSION OF QUOTE
All quotes are due no later than 2:00 PM, local Washington, D.C. time, Monday, April 7, 2008.  E-mail quotes to Chuck Tama at charles.tama@dhs.gov.  No faxes will be accepted. 

If you have questions regarding this requirement, please submit your inquiries, via email, to Chuck Tama, no later than 4:00 PM Washington, D.C. local time, Wednesday, 26 March 2008, 2007.

R.  PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT:

NATIONAL FIRE DATA CENTER, UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION, NFIRS SUPPORT CENTER
Statement of Objectives
1.0 Scope
In order to support the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), the contractor shall operate a support center for state and local participants of the NFIRS system. The center shall operate between the core hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays and provide assistance to users who have questions which may include but not be limited to the following:

?	How to participate in NFIRS.
?	Coding interpretations for NFIRS incident reports.
?	Questions concerning the USFA client software or web based reporting tools.
?	Questions from independent software vendors concerning software specifications and vendor software validation. 

When not responding to telephone or email inquires Support Center staff may assist in verifying questionable incident data and fire department census data using records provided by the COTR. These activities are performed only as time permits when not responding to requests for assistance.
2.0 Project Background
The United States Fire Administration (USFA) is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security?s Federal Emergency Management Agency.  It was established in 1974 by the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act (P.L. 93-498).  The mission of the USFA is to reduce life and economic losses due to fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support. Customers include the U.S. fire service (career and volunteer), allied fire and life safety professionals, and the general public.

The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act authorizes the National Fire Data Center in the USFA to gather and analyze information on the magnitude of the nation's fire problem as well as its detailed characteristics and trends. The act further authorizes the USFA to develop uniform data reporting methods, and to encourage and assist state agencies in developing and reporting fire data. In order to carry out the intentions of the Act, the National Fire Data Center established the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) in 1976.  NFIRS consists of a package that includes forms, a coding structure for data processing purposes, a standard system specification, manuals, computer software and procedures and documentation for utilizing the system.
NFIRS was created at a time when the magnitude and nature of the fire problem was neither well documented nor widely disseminated.  Key goals for NFIRS were to quantify the magnitude of U.S. Fire problem (in terms of total numbers of fires, deaths, injuries, and direct dollar loss) and to encourage and promote fire reporting in state and local jurisdictions.  These goals were further refined to include an understanding of the causes and demographics of fires ? who is affected, where, and how ? as well as the use and effectiveness of fire protection features.  Much of what we know about the nature, frequency, casualties, and causes of fires has been derived from the two-plus decades of NFIRS data. As a data collection tool in the fire world, it is virtually unparalleled and has been used internationally as an example data collection vehicle for fire data collection.
NFIRS collects fire incident data from state fire data systems.  The state systems, in turn, collect data from their individual fire departments. State participation in NFIRS is entirely voluntary and the guidelines for departmental participation within each state are determined by the state fire marshal?s office or an equivalent agency. These guidelines can vary significantly from state to state. In most states reporting by local departments is not mandatory. The departments who report are those willing to participate and who can afford the additional commitment necessary to collect the data.  Within the NFIRS States, participating local fire departments fill out the Incident reports as fires occur. They forward the completed incidents via paper forms or digital transactions through their state reporting authority to the USFA where the data is validated and consolidated into a single computerized database. This database is used to answer questions about the nature and causes of injuries and deaths resulting from fires: and on property losses. This information is disseminated through a variety of means to states and other organizations.
The NFIRS represents the world's largest, national, annual database of fire incident information. Approximately 22,000 fire departments, located in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the DOD participate in the NFIRS. Participating departments report an average of 14 million incidents and 1 million fires each year. 
  
3.0 Objectives 
USFA intends to achieve the following goals under this procurement:  Provide a single point of contact for state and local NFIRS users in order to respond to all NFIRS relating questions.  Provide NFIRS user issue tracking and resolution status updates for telephone and email inquiries.  Respond to inquiries from NFIRS participants on the proper coding of NFIRS forms for various incident scenarios.  Respond to inquiries from NFIRS participants needing assistance and troubleshooting problems with the USFA?s NFIRS Data Entry tool. Respond to inquiries from NFIRS participants needing assistance and troubleshooting problems with the USFA?s NFIRS web based reporting and administrative tools.  Respond to inquiries from software vendors on the USFA Vendor Validation tool.  Respond to inquiries from NFIRS participants on system questions or issues related to vendor data submission to USFA.  Provide tracking of NFIRS Vendor Issues.  Respond to inquiries from NFIRS vendors on system questions or issues related to vendor data submission to USFA.  Provide support to National Fire Data Center analytic staff by contacting fire departments in order to verify and validate data from select NFIRS reports. Conduct follow-up calls to fire departments that have not returned USFA fire department census forms and validate questionable entries.  Compile and maintain an electronic database of significant fire related events monitored through a subscription news service.  Refer any questions unrelated to NFIRS, and requests that are not able to be resolved to the COTR.

4.0 Constraints:  Any issues that require specific IT support shall be escalated to the Tier-2 staff who maintain the NFIRS Integrated IT Support Services contract at the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC).  Services shall be performed on site between Monday through Friday between the core hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m., except for Federal holidays.  NFIRS telephone support hotline calls and email inquiries shall take priority over all other tasks.  Tasks other than telephone or email inquires requesting assistance with NFIRS shall be performed as time permits.  Estimated hours required for support center staff working at the NETC are as follows: Base year: 4,160; Option Year 1: 4,000; Option Year 2; 3,845; Option Year 3: 3,695; Option year 4: 3,550
5.0 Deliverables   
The following documents and deliverables will be delivered to the COTR as required. Documents will be created and delivered in MS Word file format and in hard copy, unless stated otherwise.  The contractor shall provide a monthly report summarizing the activities performed for the previous month. The report for the calendar month is due in the COTR?s office by the 15th of each month following the first full calendar month after the contract award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   The solicitation number for this procurement is F2Q3658059A002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541620. This requirement is a total (100%) Small Business Set-Aside. SPECIFICATIONS:  Storm Water Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation for Langley Air Force Base.  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) issued Langley Air Force Base (AFB) a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Individual Permit for Industrial Storm Water Discharges in May 2005.  The permit requires Langley AFB to perform an annual Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation (CSCE).  This evaluation ensures that the Base remains compliant with the permits requirements and the guidelines prescribed in the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).  The purpose of this work is to perform the annual CSCE as required by the Base's existing individual storm water discharge permit (VA0083194).  The completed document should be designed and tailored for its intended audience, being as brief as possible but still presenting the required information in a readily accessible manner. The project shall be accomplished in three phases.  Phase I shall be the Kick-off Meeting.  Phase II shall encompass visual inspections of the individual base industrial activities to perform the CSCE and contractor preparation of the CSCE report.  The contractor shall furnish all materials, equipment, supplies, personnel, transportation, and all other resources necessary, to perform a CSCE, evaluate the efficiency of current storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs) identified during the site evaluation.  Applicable Laws and Regulations:  Occupational Health and Safety Administration, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.120, July 1, 1994. Clean Water Act (as amended); 40 CFR 122.  DOD Directive 6050. 1: Environmental Effects in the United States of DOD Actions, July 1979.  Langley AFB Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (No. VA0083194), 2 May 2005.  9 VAC 25-31-10 et seq. Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Permit, 11 April 2001. Regulations and permits for Virginia may be more stringent than the federal laws and must be considered in assessments.  In addition, contractor must ensure that CSCE requirement meets all Air Force requirements, and appropriate regulatory guidance, to include but not limited to:  Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, Installation Stormwater Pollution Prevention Guide, updated May 1997, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7041, Water Quality Compliance,13 May 1994,  AFI 32-7080,Pollution Prevention Program, 12 May 1994; Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, ?Environmental Quality,? 20 July 1994; Executive Order 12088, Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards,  13 October 1978; United States Environmental Protection Agency, Storm Water Management for Industrial Activities, Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices (EPA 832-R-92-006).  The Government will supply the contractor upon request with available copies (either hard copy or electronic file) of engineering drawings of the installation?s storm sewer system including outfalls, monitoring stations, previous CSCE reports or related engineering studies, operating records and analytical results, and other documents that may be of value in defining the installations SWPPP issues.  The contractor shall reproduce these documents and return the originals to the government within 72 hours of issue. Site visits and meetings are to be combined whenever possible.  The contractor shall prepare a meeting notice and agenda for each meeting attended by the contractor.  In addition to developing an agenda, the contractor shall prepare a presentation, appropriate for the occasion, and handle the administrative details of the meeting.  The administrative details the contractor shall perform, with assistance from the Technical Representative, include: set the time and secure the location of the meeting, notify potential attendees of the meeting arrangements, pass out an attendance sheet at the meeting, take notes of salient points of the meeting, prepare and distribute a conference report on the meeting to all attendees within 14 calendar days of the meeting and revise the conference report should the government request it.  The contractor shall initiate the project with a kickoff meeting at Langley AFB, VA. This kickoff meeting shall cover the CSCE requirement. During this meeting, the contractor shall introduce the personnel proposed to work on the CSCE and their respective roles and responsibilities.  The presentation shall be complete upon submission, by the contractor, of an organization flow chart illustrating the roles and responsibilities of contractor personnel on these projects.  During this meeting, the contractor shall present his approach to both projects.  The contractor shall present proposed outlines, formats, and contents for the CSCE and demonstrate how this approach will best meet the goals of the project.  Also, the proposed agenda for the first meeting with the VDEQ regulators will be presented and discussed at this time. The contractor shall coordinate with 1 CES/CEVC to develop the agenda.  The contractor shall visit each individual base industrial activity to perform a Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation.  The evaluation shall provide the following information and documentation: A visual inspection of areas contributing to storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.  The purpose being to identify existing and potential sources of pollutants entering the storm sewer system; An evaluation of measures to reduce pollutant loadings to determine if existing controls are adequate and properly implemented in accordance with the terms of the permit or whether additional measures are needed;  Structural storm water management measures, sediment and erosion control measures, and other structural pollution control measures identified in the plan shall be observed to ensure they are operating properly;  A visual inspection of equipment needed to implement the plan, such as spill response equipment, shall be made;  Based on the results of the inspection, the description of potential pollutant sources identified in the plan and pollution prevention measures and controls identified in the plan shall be revised as appropriate.  This task shall be accomplished in conjunction with Air Force personnel.  This approach allows the contractor to validate existing information and discuss additional modifications or improvements that can be incorporated into the CSCE.

The contractor shall compile the information from the site visit and summarize it into a report.  The report shall contain the following information and documentation:  A summary of the scope of the inspection, personnel making the inspection, dates of inspection, and major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP; Identification of any incidents of non-compliance.

The contractor shall submit monthly progress reports via electronic mail, which identify the status of the work performed and estimates the progress completed, expressed as a percentage.  The progress report shall include a brief narrative, addressing the major work items, as well as a time-scaled bar chart or CPM design schedule showing the sequence of the events involved in carrying out the project within the specified period of performance.  The chart should provide a general level of scheduling with planning efforts focused on identifying major items that most often control the flow of work.  This schedule should also be a forward planning monitoring tool with milestone submittal dates clearly identified.  The monthly report shall be submitted to the Technical Representative and contract administrator until the project is at closeout as specified by the contracting officer.  The table at Attachment 1 contains the deliverable schedule.  Attachment 2 contains the payment-monitoring plan.

The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award a fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as a result of this solicitation.  This solicitation will incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 with a Size Standard restriction of 12.5 million dollars.  The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials and equipment required to provide COMPREHENSIVE ACCREDITATION INSPECTIONS/SURVEYS of all Veteran Health Administration (VHA) medical laboratories - those in medical centers and in clinics. The contractor must have deemed status from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The vendor shall examine all aspects of medical laboratory operations including director and personnel qualifications, resources and facilities, quality control and quality assurance. The accreditation program will include published standards and checklists, mandatory participation in external proficiency survey programs, and biennial onsite inspections.  As required by VHA policy, all medical laboratories must have an onsite inspection every two years.   In rare instances and with the approval of the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (P&LMS) National Enforcement Office, the inspection/survey date may be extended beyond two calendar years but not more than 45 days past the anniversary date under any circumstances.  The vendor(s) shall provide each laboratory with a list of deficiencies to correct and allow written responses to these deficiencies before final disposition and accreditation.  The vendor(s) must provide reports to the laboratory, the Pathology Regional Commissioners and the P&LMS National Enforcement Office in headquarters. If interim annual self-inspections are required as a part of the accreditation process, the laboratory will retain the list of deficiencies and corrective action for review at the next onsite inspection, but results of these inspections/surveys will be tracked and published in the report for the P&LMS National Enforcement Office.  Inspectors/Surveyors must be knowledgeable in the areas being inspected. The vendor(s) will define standards for inspectors/surveyors. Vendor(s) must describe in detail their inspection process, including their requirements for inspections/surveys and training provided to the inspectors/surveyors.  Deficiencies will be specifically noted in writing and the laboratory must be informed of all deficiencies. Serious deficiencies will require follow up correction by the laboratory.  The entire process for noting deficiencies, required follow-up, and any additional inspections, will be well documented.  The P&LMS National Enforcement Office and relevant Regional Commissioner's Office will be kept appraised of such actions. The vendor(s) will provide the laboratory with a copy of the standards used for the inspection/survey.  The laboratory medical director will be notified of the need for inspection/survey six months before the inspection/survey date and provided with the necessary forms needed to apply for inspection/survey.  The laboratory will be provided with the name of the inspection/survey leader and specific inspection/survey date together with any requests or information to be sent to the inspector/surveyor six weeks before date of the inspection/survey.  Vendor(s) will provide Accreditation decisions to the laboratory medical director in writing within 90 days.  The vendor(s) must have the ability to coordinate and perform system inspections/surveys if requested. Manuals and Publications:  The vendor(s) must provide to the facility, Regional Commissioners, and National Enforcement Office, applicable manuals, accreditation standards, and inspection checklists.  These should also be available in electronic format. The vendor(s) shall notify the government when applicable updates become available and provide such updates as indicated above.

No Offeror without deemed status shall be awarded a contract.  Price shall be evaluated for amount and reasonableness.  The Offeror must provide a rational basis for the price proposed using complexity points or other defined criteria for lab size and complexity used in its accreditation practice. This basis shall be used to establish CLINS which allow fixed prices for labs of differing sizes, tests and complexity levels.  Offerors may submit their discounted "commercial" price list with an explanation of how the pricing would apply to 3 lab types (minimal, moderate, and high complexity as defined in current accreditation standards).

As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-75, insert the following clause:
HSAR 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any
subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to
any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall
be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present
value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed
appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard
transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

(End of provision)

                         NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

Q5 Does the FAR 52.225-1 Buy American Act?Supplies apply to all of the  elements of the Shelter in Place Emergency Supply Kit or to some of the elements? If the FAR applies to some of the kit, please provide a list of the foreign articles that will be treated as domestic for this contract.

Q6 Is there a preference to use a drawstring bag or a zipper bag that resembles that of a backpack? 
A6 There is no preference.

Q7 Since the shelf life of D size batteries are unpredictable at times of need, can any other flashlight or radio be used that does not require D batteries such as a squeeze flashlight or rotation outpower supply device flashlight/radio providing that the item meets requirements and is less costly than ones with the batteries?
A7 See Amendment 1 -Questions and Answers.(D cell batteries only)

Q12 In looking at this solicitation and I have a question as to the buy American Act. Now don?t get me wrong I believe in this Act but if we were to 	purchase all of these items and place them into the kit it would be very expensive.
