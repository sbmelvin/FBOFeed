<DESC>The Center for Mental Health Services (DHHS).
 through the Division of Acquisition Management, PSC plans to
award a sole source simplified acquisition to Joanne Nicholson PhD,
Director, Center for Mental Health Services and Associate Professor of
of Psychiatry. University of Massachusetts Medical Services. Worcester, MA.
PURPOSE:	
The goal of this procurement is to integrate data from these four databases, located at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Center for Mental Health Services Research (CMHSR), to address a set of specific issues and questions about parents with mental illness and their families, and policies and programs through the preparation of four articles suitable for publication in professional peer-reviewed journals and three or four presentations at major professional and advocate venues. The articles and presentations will address the following:

1.	Who are parents with mental illness and their families?  Myths and realities.  A paper will be prepared integrating UMMS Center data, including key informant and focus group interviews, with previous research to describe the prevalence and impact of parental mental illness on adults and children, and their experiences.  Most of what we have learned in the past decade in the U.S. about the experiences of parents with mental illness is based on research with small samples of mothers in the public sector with severe mental illness and multiple stressors such as poverty and ethnic minority status.  Prior research will be critiqued using new UMMS findings.

2.	What has happened in the past decade to address the needs of parents and their families?  A 10-year follow-up.  Data from the recent UMMS survey of SMHAs and the national program survey will be compared with findings from the original UMMS survey of SMHA commissioners and directors regarding policies and programs for parents with mental illness and their families.  Comprehensive data from the recent survey will be used to describe the extent to which states report that services are integrated and family-centered.

3.	What factors contribute to policy and program development and change?  Comprehensive data from the 51 State Mental Health Agencies (SMHA) commissioners allow us to classify states in four categories ranging from extremely responsive (SMHAs identified parents, provided programs for parents, and had policies specific to parents) to not responsive (SMHAs did not identify parents, did not provide programs for parents, and had no policies specific to parenting).  State case study interview findings provide elaboration of the factors contributing to or prohibiting change in state policies and programs. This paper will "tell the story" of how different states have prioritized the parental role of adult clients, and moved towards integrated and family-centered services.  

4.	What are the components of "best practice?"  Innovative and promising programs have been developed in the U.S. and other countries over the last 20 years, though they are small in number.  Providers and families may piece services together in areas in which there are no services specifically targeted to meeting their needs.  Program models and outcomes have often been determined by perception of need and the requirements of funding sources, rather than from theory or research. National program survey data and key informant interviews will be used to identify the key elements of best practice in working with families in which parents have mental illness. Recommendations will be made for future evaluation efforts.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

All sources interested in pursuing the NPOESS EMD/Production acquisition must regularly visit the NPOESS electronic library (http://npoesslib.ipo.noaa.gov) to see if the draft or final RFP is available; no paper copies will be mailed.  HISTORY: The IPO awarded two Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contracts in December 1999 resulting from RFP F04701-99-R-0500.  That PDRR RFP indicated that the future EMD/Production acquisition would be open to all sources, including those that did not win PDRR contracts; but it also clearly indicated that all EMD/Production offerors would be required to demonstrate a level of maturity at least equivalent to the level to be attained under the PDRR contracts at no expense to the Government.  The two PDRR contractors are TRW Space and Electronics Group and Lockheed Martin Space Systems; both of these contractors are expected to submit a proposal for the NPOESS EMD/Production acquisition.  Any interested subcontractors may market their expertise and products to these firms directly.  Any other firm interested in the NPOESS EMD/Production acquisition as a prime offeror should contact the contracting officer without delay so that it may share how it intends to demonstrate its achievement of PDR (preliminary design review) level of maturity on its NPOESS solution.  You are advised that an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors during the down-selection phase of the acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the System program director or the contracting officer, but to assist in communicating offeror concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality regarding the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The Acting Ombudsman, Mr. William Orzech, can be reached at (310) 363-0886. See numbered note 26.

<DESC>Aircraft Maintenance.  The National Interagency Fire Center has a need to increase the amount of time services can be obtained under five existing aircraft maintenance contracts that expire in February.  This extension of time is needed in order to keep the fleet maintained until follow-on contracts are in place.  Competitive follow-on contracts are in the process of being solicited under Request for Proposals Number 49-02-01, and we anticipate new contracts to be awarded in May of 2002.  Due to the emergency nature of our work, it is critical that the services be maintained without a break in service.  
Aircraft maintenance services include the inspection, repair, alteration, installation or modification, refurbishment, overhaul and painting of aircraft, and the purchase, installation, and rebuilding of aircraft parts, engines, propellers, components, accessories, and avionics.  Any offeror interested in submitting a technical proposal is given notice that the repair qualifications and knowledge of the aircraft being repaired must be demonstrated.  The following technical criteria must be addressed and will be evaluated (more detailed text available upon request):  (1) Past Performance, (2) Knowledge and Understanding of the Work, (3) Facilities and Equipment, (4) Experience, and (5) Offeror Location The NIFC believes that the existing five contracts should be extended for a short time.  All other interested firms may submit technical proposals in response to this notice.  Proposals shall address the technical evaluation criteria above, and must be received by the close of business on March 4, 2002.  A determination not to open this short term requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government based upon it's evaluation of proposals received.
Please note that proposals received as a result of this notice will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate and possible to obtain competitive procurements for this short-term requirement.  No solicitation document is currently available. Please contact the Contracting Officer listed below if you have questions, rather than using the e-mail.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Nano-engineered sorbents, partly organic and partly inorganic, developed by Battelle and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have proven to be exceptionally selective and efficient in removing heavy metals and other contaminants from waste streams.  These sorbents are self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports--SAMMS--and form effective sorbents for a wide variety of species including mercury, heavy metals, radionuclides and anions.  Silica ceramics containing ordered arrays of cylindrical pores are first prepared.  The pore diameter can be adjusted from 2 to 20 nm, with 5 to 6 nm being the typical diameter used in the sorbents.  The inside surfaces of the channel-like pores are then coated with an organic monolayer whose molecules are covalently bonded to the silica.  The free ends of the tethered molecules can be chemically tailored to sequester particular species from solution.  The exceptionally high surface area of the mesoporous silica support--typically between 900 and 1,000 square meters per gram--gives the SAMMS a very high binding capacity, with the open-pore structure allowing solution species easy access to the pore surfaces, leading to their rapid sorption.  The SAMMS material is readily tailored to absorb the species of interest.  Please visit the SAMMS website at:  www.pnl.gov/etd/product/samms/index.htm.  Please see US Patent No. 6,326,326.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Cobalt ferrate (CoFe2O4) is a magnetic oxide of considerable interest for next-generation magnetic read/write technology due to its enhanced magnetic properties.  Although the properties of the bulk material are well understood, well defined thin-films (<100nm) have not been synthesized and characterized.  By using molecular beam epitaxy, we present here epitaxial films of cobalt ferrate on MgO(001) possessing compositions within 10% of  the desired 2:1 Fe to Co ratio within the cation sublattice of the inverse spinel structure.  The material shows excellent promise as a pinning layer in read/write devices that would operate at or above room temperature.  Well-ordered crystalline films with atomically flat surfaces result from this growth process, and the resulting material exhibits a strain-dependant magnetic anisotropy that is determined largely by film thickness, but that exhibits a Curie temperature above 300C.  Structural and surface morphological studies by RHEED, XRD and AFM reveal excellent crystallinity and atomically flat film surfaces.  Typical RHEED patterns for the substrate and film surfaces reveal both the extent of crystallographic order and flatness of the film surface.  The new diffraction streaks seen in the film patterns are characteristic of the factor-of-two difference in the lattice parameters for MgO and Co ferrite.  AFM images reveal root-mean-square roughnesses of only 0.1 - 0.2 nm for 100 nm thick films, which is considerably better than that published for PLD grown Co ferrite.  In addition, out-of-plane XRD rocking curves obtained with non-monochromatic Cu Ka x-rays reveal full-width at half-maximum values of -0.09 degrees, which indicates excellent crystallinity within the bulk of the film.  Finally, MFM images reveal large, stable magnetic domains of lateral dimension ? 140 nm for 100 nm thick films.  In addition, SQUID hysteresis loops show in-plane magnetic remanences of 65% and 40% at 150K and 300K, respectively, for a field orientation along [100].  The in-plane coercive field as a function of temperature shows very high values at low temperatures (e.g. >14 KOe at 125K), but also -1 KOe at 350K, revealing that the Curie temperature is above 300K.  Thus, the material shows excellent promise as a pinning layer in read/write devices that would operate at or above room temperature.  Patent Pending.   	Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This technology is a method for producing a titanium oxide-containing film on a substrate that involves preparing an aqueous solution of a titanium chelate and immersing a substrate in the aqueous solution for a time sufficient to produce an adherent titanium oxide film on the substrate surface.  The coating increases the selectivity of membranes used in gas separations.  It is also a means for depositing the films directly on to hydrophobic surfaces, such as polyethylene, to increase their resistance to ultraviolet damage.  The process is believed to be particularly applicable to the coating of gas permeable membranes (to increase selectivity in separations) and plastic parts (to increase resistance to damage from ultraviolet light).  After preparing an aqueous solution of a titanium chelate, a substrate is immersed in the solution until a titanium oxide film adheres to the substrate surface.  The titanium chelate may be an acid or base, decomposed by temperature or other means.  The immersion process produces uniform coverage and high adhesion of the coating to the substrate.  The process is believed to be particularly applicable to the coating of gas permeable membranes (to increase selectivity in separations) and plastic parts (to increase resistance to damage from ultraviolet light).  It is also a means for depositing the films directly on to hydrophobic surfaces, such as polyethylene, to increase their resistance to ultraviolet damage.  The hard surface may also provide scratch resistant coatings for lenses and the like.  Experimental tests have shown that this technique is extremely effective in reducing yellowing and other degradation of commercially available plastic parts exposed to light (e.g. light fixtures).  Although industrial scale-up has not been investigated, it is believed to be fairly straightforward since this is an aqueous solution deposition technique.
Other thin film preparation techniques, such as liquid methods often result in films of low density, whose microstructures are poorly controlled.  Thin films produced by liquid solution methods also suffer shrinkage and cracking during drying, crystallization and sintering.  Gas-phase methods require direct growth of materials by heterogeneous nucleation from the gas phase; requiring high temperatures at the source and a vacuum, thus increasing costs and limiting processing choices.
Advantages:  (1) Low cost easy to perform--Does not require high temperatures or vacuum; (2) Uniformly coats complex and irregular shapes.  Potential Applications:  (1) Protective layers for lenses.  (2)  Selective filters.  Can be used to block uv, infrared, or microwave radiation.  (3)  Self-cleaning windows. (4)  Selective gas-permeable films.  (5)  Semiconductors, magnetic films electrochemical sensors, or electro-optic devices.  Please see US Patent No. 5,766,784.   	Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Glow Discharge Plasma (GDP) is an aggressive water treatment technology for destroying recalcitrant or refractory compounds. GDP uses high electric fields to create a nonthermal plasma in direct contact with the surface of a water film. The plasma creates extremely active radicals and ions that destroy contaminants at the surface of the water. Efficient design of GDP equipment includes effective mass transfer of contaminants to the water surface where destruction reactions are rapid. The chemistries involved are similar to electron beam treatment of water, however, no harmful x-rays are emitted. The technology is cost competitive with UV based advanced oxidation technologies  Please see www.pnl.gov/etd/product/gdp.htm for further information.  Please see US Patent No. 5,980,701.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This invention is the synthesis and characterization of a class of novel Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) films that have the uniquely combined properties of high-transmissivity in the infrared portion of the spectrum and high electrical conductivity.  They are also magnetic.  The TCOs can be used as optical coatings for infrared sensors, solar cells, and flat panel displays requiring high long-wavelength throughput.  Both the composition of the TCOs and the described methods of preparation are novel and unique for applications involving optical coatings.  The materials are oxides with a spinel crystal structure.  For example, the TCO film consisting of an oxide of cobalt and nickel (Ni1-xCoxOy) exhibits electrical conductivities as high as 20 S-cm-1 for a single-layer 20nm thick film, and transmissivities between 70 and 90% were realized for a 3-layer film between 2.5 and 15 ?m.  The films are somewhat absorbent at shorter wavelengths, with single-layer film transmission decreasing from 70% at 0.8 pm to 40% at 0.3 ?m.  Another spinel oxide composition containing Pd and Ni, was found to have similarly desirable electronic and optical properties.  These TCO films are made by spin coating from aqueous or ethanolic solutions, and are uniform as shown by SEM at magnifications as high as 10,000X.  Sputtered films have similar properties.  Details have been published:  Infrared Transparent Spinal Films with P-type Conductivity, C.F. Windisch, G.J Exarhos, et al., Thin Solid Films, 2001, 398-399, 45-52.  Potential applications:  (1)  Optical coatings for flat panel displays, infrared sensors, and solar cells.  (2)  Optical limiters and switches.  (3)  Devices that rely on the non-linear optical response of their components.  (4)  Photovoltaic-powered electrochromic devices, including electrochromic windows.  Patent pending.

<DESC>It is the intention of this solicitation to obtain maintenance services to the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system; and electrical system including emergency generators at Bldg. W-143, Sewells Point, Norfolk, Virginia.  The United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps have acquired a contract to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end information services through a common computing and communications environment.  The contract ensures the transmission of voice, video, and data information. Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS), 13600 EDS Drive, Herndon, VA  20171, has been awarded the contract to perform the required services. In addition to EDS performing the service to provide comprehensive information technology capabilities, EDS has been tasked with maintaining a proper environment for the mainframe equipment that is housed in allocated spaces provided to the contractor.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Commander Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) and NMCI contractor (EDS) is established to provide on-site maintenance (emergency service, recurring, and preventative) of all systems within the government furnished facility that was allocated to support this operation.  Because of the MOU, EDS maintains the HVAC systems and generators to support the computer equipment in their allocated spaces.  Support for the remainder of the building?s HVAC systems and generators not associated with the NMCI contract are the subjects of this requirement.  Systems specifications indicate that all the HVAC systems and generators are on the same circuit and there are no separate controls to regulate the flow of air condition or the heating system.  Since EDS maintains their portion of the systems, it would only be feasible for EDS to maintain the entire system throughout the building.  If the government elects to procure services from a separate contractor, there would be no way to determine where EDS level of responsibility ends and where the other contractor?s level of responsibility begins. This proposed contract action is for the services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6-302.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Drug Courts Program Office (DCPO) attends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the National Rural Alcohol and Drug Abuse Network, Inc. (NRADAN), P.O. Box 40, Tony, WI 54563-0040 in support of  the eighteenth annual national conferences.  The NRADAN conferences are scheduled for June 2-6, 2002, at the University of Wisconsin-Stout in Menomonie, WI. The NRADAN will offer three rural drug court tracks entitled: "Basic Track", "Advanced Track" and "Adolescent and Family Track".  NRADAN was established  in 1985 in response to the unique needs of over 65 million people living and working in rural communities  that were not being addressed by a majority of the existing alcohol and drug abuse programs. The  goal of NRADAN is to bring excellence in prevention and treatment to the non-urban population. NRADAN's  goal is met through: an annual national conference to provide an opportunity for participants to network with other rural alcohol and drug abuse professionals, Federal agency representatives, and to receive training from nationally recognized Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse experts.  Also, the NRADAN provides regional professional development seminars for individuals serving the alcohol and drug abuse prevention field; publishes rural specific resource materials; and operates a rural RADAR Specialty Center to offer technical assistance and consulting services on rural-specific needs and issues.  The need for drug court tracks is due to Rural America experiencing an increase in drug abuse that rivals its urban and metropolitan counterparts.  Drug courts have proven to be very effective in reducing recidivism and improving treatment outcomes for drug offender population.    The annual conference provides an opportunity for OJP/DCPO to disseminate information and training on drug courts to rural communities, an audience not reached through other conferences. This purchase order shall be negotiated in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 2152 (c) (1) ? Only one responsible source with unique capabilities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

<SUBJECT>B -- B ? Neochim Mixed Fertilizers Project Feasibility Study, Bulgaria
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0270017A
<RESPDATE>032902
<ARCHDATE>04132002
<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Dimitar Dimitrov, Executive Director and Member of the Board, Neochim s.a., 6403 Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria, Phone: 011 359 391 60558, Fax: 011 359 60555:

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to review and analyze Neochim?s operations in detail and make recommendations for the development of a mixed fertilizers facility at the complex.  

Neochim s.a. operates an integrated fertilizer complex within its petrochemical facility.  The plant is located on a 570 acre site in Dimitrovgrad, approximately 200 km east of Sofia, 45 km north of Kurdzhali, and 40 km south of Stara Zagora. The site is easily accessible by rail and road from major cities within Bulgaria and from Turkey and Greece.  The company produces a wide range of petrochemical products, but concentrates mainly on ammonium nitrate (630,000 metric tons/year), ammonia (410,000 metric tons/year) and formaldehyde.  

The company has identified an opportunity to market additional products for the domestic market. Excessive use of ammonium nitrate fertilizers in the past has resulted in high soil acidity and low crop yields in Bulgaria. This has created an opportunity for production and sale of mixed fertilizers to increase potassium and calcium content in the soil.  Neochim has excess ammonia production capacity that can be used to feed the new plant. This reduces overall capital costs and balances the company?s ammonia production capacity with the overall plant needs. 

The company believes that the domestic farming community would be able to purchase the new fertilizers.  In addition, the recent ownership of land restructuring will permit foreigners to own and farm land, and export products, which is expected to increase demand for the company?s products.  The chemical fertilizer industry in Bulgaria and the region has become highly competitive due to high natural gas prices and a depressed agricultural market.  Neochim has been able to operate at 65% to 70% of its capacity, has taken measures to reduce costs, and has been able to enter new markets.  

Neochim recently received a $254,000 grant from TDA for an energy efficiency feasibility study. That project looks to improve the plant?s cost structure, and is largely based on energy conservation and reduction of emissions.  It will utilize excess steam to generate power, which can be consumed inside the plant, and represents approximately 25 ? 33% of plant power demand. The project cost is estimated at $10 million.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $275,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, March 29, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) has a requirement to contract for services to administer the distribution of redress funds.  BCP enforces various statutes enacted to protect consumers against unfair, deceptive or fraudulent business practices.  To perform this mission, BCP prosecutes law enforcement actions in federal courts and before administrative law judges.  In many cases, this litigation results in the award of redress money in that is to be returned to consumers affected by the challenged practices.  The disbursement of the money in the redress fund is made pursuant to a distribution plan either approved by the court or the administrative law judge or delegated to the FTC's discretion.  In some cases, if direct payment to consumers or indirect restitution is not practical, the redress money is used to fund a tailored consumer education program as a remedy.  In all cases where money judgements are ordered, a major component of the redress administration process requires management of the monetary award in order to protect and enhance this asset fund.  In addition to money management and consumer education, contractor shall provide help services to assist potential claimants in obtaining information relating to the redress fund; distribute redress funds; provide FTC with final accounting of redress funds; and prepare reports and maintain records concerning redress administration.  The FTC anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts.  The contracts will contain a base year, four option years and five award terms (years).  It is anticipated that contract performance will begin no later than June 1, 2002. Services are being solicited unrestricted.  Solicitation packages will be available on or about March 8, 2002.  Solicitation packages may be downloaded via FBO or mailed to you upon request.  Fax requests for solicitation to (202) 326-3529, Attn: Eric Vogt.

52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

 	1) Technical Experience and Past Performance

Technical Experience--The offeror shall submit documentation describing its experience as a company or corporation or by its employees or personnel they have retained in performing and managing maintenance and repairs of hoists.  Experience may be commercial and/or Governmental.  Offerors shall have a minimum of 10 years cumulative experience working on the specified types of hoists.   This experience requirement relates to the company and/or key personnel.  Thus, a firm in existence for less than 10 years, but having key personnel with at least 10 years of required experience, may be able to meet this requirement.

Past Performance--The offeror shall submit references relevant to the nature and magnitude of this requirement for the past ten (10) years from previous/current requirements of this type of work.  Required documentation shall contain the name of the reference, a point of contact, phone number and address for each reference.   This information shall be submitted with the offer and shall include, but not be limited to, contract number, scope and magnitude of the contract, point of contact name and telephone number.  It shall also include a short narrative which adequately describes the offeror's actual past performance.  For example, the narratives shall describe the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, as well as business-like commitment to customer satisfaction.  Past performance will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offerors lacking past performance information will be rated neutral (=pass).
  
2) Price    

Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  The lowest price offer will be computed by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basis period.  Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in Far 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness.

Technical experience and past performance are significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The above Provisions and Clauses may be obtained via Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil. All proposals must be mailed to Carl See at 97 CONS/LGCA, 205 S. 6th Street Altus AFB OK 73523-5147, or may be faxed to Carl See at fax number (580) 481-7472. Award will be made to the lowest responsive and responsible offeror. Proposals are required not later than 2:00 PM CST, 26 Feb 2002. All contractors must be registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration database prior to any contract award. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available. This solicitation is distributed on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Internet site only.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is seeking applications on behalf of the Office of Power Technologies in DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, for support of projects that are consistent with the goals of the Advanced Natural Gas Reciprocating Engine Program. This solicitation requests applications from only United States (US) universities and colleges for research activities that will make a significant impact in achieving the program goals stated below.  In order to attain these goals, innovative and novel concepts need to be developed and current obstacles need to be overcome. To achieve the project objectives, the applicant shall succinctly describe the proposed technical approach to solve the emissions challenge for reciprocating engines. Specifically, university research proposals are being solicited for development of aftertreatment concepts for natural gas reciprocating engines. The nature of the proposal in response to this solicitation should be structured for longer term, basic and fundamental research appropriate for university research facilities. However, it is important that university researcher applicants be mindful of the US reciprocating manufacturer's needs. In other words, applications should propose research that has reasonable probability of contributing to long-term (5-7 year) manufacturer product development cycles. The most valuable contribution will be knowledge useful to reciprocating manufactures to decide which path, among many alternatives, that emissions equipment product development should proceed. With considerable input from the Advanced Reciprocating Engines Systems (ARES) manufacturing consortium, DOE/NETL through the Office of Power Technologies Advanced Natural Gas Reciprocating Engine Program, is requesting applications under the following topic area of "Aftertreatment Concepts for Advanced Natural Gas Reciprocating Engines." All questions concerning this solicitation should be submitted by way of the "Submit Question" feature of IIPS.  All requests for technical explanation or interpretation shall be submitted through IIPS and must be received not later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 17, 2002.  The Government reserves the right not to respond to questions submitted after this date. Questions regarding the operation of IIPS should be sent to the IIPS site administrator by e-mail at IIPS_HelpDesk@ e-center.doe.gov or call the Help Desk at 1-800-683-0751.

Request for Stage One Technical Qualification Proposals. The General Services Administration (GSA), Heartland Region, is soliciting proposals from design-building firms, partnerships, or joint ventures for bridging Design-Build (D-B) Services Contract for the Fa?ade Replacement (IIA21040) at the Federal Building at 210 Walnut, Des Moines, IA. -- Solicitation Number GS-06P-01-GZC-0512. Total estimated cost of services is $10,000,000 - $15,000,000. The Stage One Request for Technical Qualification Proposals (RFTQP) solicitation is expected to be issued on or about March 1, 2002.  A Pre-Proposal conference will be held in Des Moines, IA on March 14, 2002.  RFTQP's will be received on or about April 4, 2002.  Point of Contact: GSA Contracting Officer, Ms. Linda E. Hale, telephone (816) 823-4911, fax (816) 926-3571; e-mail, linda.hale@gsa.gov, and GSA Project Manager, Denise Ryerkerk, telephone (816) 823-2269, fax (816) 823-2273; e-mail denise.ryerkerk@gsa.gov.  

Interested parties may submit written request to the Contracting Officer to be placed on the bidders' mailing list to receive copies of the Stage I RFTQP upon issuance. Parties interested in receiving synopsis of the solicitation,  Stage One solicitation as well as any Amendments to the solicitation can register with FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov/EPSVendorRegistration.html using Solicitation No. GS-06P-01-GZC-0512. 

This procurement will be conducted in two stages.  Stage One will evaluate the technical qualifications to arrive at a short list of three contractors to participate in Stage Two.  Only offerors invited by the Government to participate in Stage Two may qualify for a stipend payment in the amount of $20,000 to help defray proposal development costs. The stipend payment is conditional upon receipt of a fully developed Stage Two proposal, including successful completion of interviews. Stipend distribution will occur after contract award of the D-B contract. Stage Two will evaluate a detailed technical proposal for design and construction solutions and a firm fixed price.  The Government intends to use the "greatest value concept" in selecting the prime contractor.  Only one proposal may be submitted for each stage by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The Government intends to disclose proposals received in response to this solicitation to non-government evaluators. Each evaluator will sign and provide to GSA a "Conflict of Interest Acknowledgment and Nondisclosure Agreement." An acceptable subcontracting plan for both design and construction services must be agreed to before contract award. This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval.  
REQUEST FOR STAGE ONE TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION PROPOSALS. This design-build contractor will be responsible for taking the design from the design development level, as prepared by the bridging AE, through construction drawings and construction. The building is 390,000 gross square feet and ten stories in height, with a penthouse and a basement, and houses approximately forty Federal agencies.  The project will be designed and constructed in standard foot/pound/gallon ("English") units. The project will stabilize and overclad the existing masonry facade, which has leaked since initial construction. The granite column cladding and vertical aluminum fins will be removed, the glazed brick masonry will be stabilized and overclad, and the windows will be replaced, from the inside, with energy efficient windows designed for glass fragment retention. The building will be fully occupied during construction, including two active Child Care Center's and playgrounds, and emphasis will be placed on minimizing disruption to tenants and visiting public. Other work to be done under the same contract includes roof replacement, basement waterproofing, replacement of entry doors, remodeling of the entrance canopies, vestibule, and a portion of the lobby,  perimeter landscaping and limited asbestos abatement may be required. The design should be an expression of the American architectural tradition and a visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American government. Quality material and design, low maintenance, energy efficiency, construction waste management, and sustainable design issues as defined by the LEEDS (Leadership in Energy and Design) rating system of the U.S. Green Buildings Council, are elements of the project. It is anticipated that the landscaping, basement waterproofing, and portions of the vestibule work will be options to the contract, and if exercised, will be awarded not later than October of 2003. The length of the contracting period is approximately 730 days. 

Stage One Evaluation Factors are as follows: Experience and Past Performance (40%); Qualifications of Key Personnel (40%); Team Composition & Locality Experience (20%). A pre-proposal conference to discuss project objectives and to answer Stage One questions will be held on March 14, 2002 at 1:00 p.m., Room 817, at the Federal Building, 210 Walnut, Des Moines, IA.  Those attending this conference are encouraged to arrive early, due to screening requirements at the building.  Please pre-register with the Contracting Officer via email or telephone no later than noon on March 13, 2002.  Firms may provide their questions in typed format.  Responses to all questions, whether verbal or written will be distributed to interested firms after the meeting.  To insure all interested firms are on the distribution list, firms who do not attend the conference or provide written questions in advance shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that they are interested.

Specific date and time for receipt of Stage One proposals shall be as specified in the RFTQP.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope for identification purposes.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10. 

Under Stage One, offerors must submit information to identify the offeror as an individual or as a legal business entity. The offeror shall identify the Builder and the Design Team that will provide services for the D-B and furnish qualifications and information to fulfill the Stage One proposal requirements. The offeror must identify whether or not they are a small business.  If the offeror is not a small business, a small business subcontracting plan must be submitted with the proposal for the design-build team with offer for Stage Two; the D-B will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 40 percent total for Small Business (SB), which includes 8 percent for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5 percent for Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), 2.5 percent for HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone SB) and 5 percent for Veteran-Owned (Including 3 percent for Service Disabled) Small Business (VOSB). In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract should provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned business.  Offerors must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize small, small disadvantaged and women-owned businesses. 


The Government will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the Stage One RFTQP, and will advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.

STAGE TWO COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.   The three (3) most highly qualified Stage One offerors will be requested to submit Phase Two competitive proposals in response to a Request for Phase Two Competitive Proposals (RFCP).  The names of the offerors selected to participate in Stage Two will be published in FedBizOpps. The offerors selected to participate in Stage Two will be notified of the submittal requirements for Stage Two.  Stage Two submission requirements will include the submission of a detailed technical proposal and management plan addressing the RFCP's scope of work, and a firm-fixed price proposal for providing the services required.  Offreors responding to Stage Two must submit a complete subcontracting plan for both the design and construction services.  A bid guarantee in the amount of 20% of the offer or $3 Million, whichever is lesser, will be required of offerors participating in the Stage Two competition.

The NAICS for this acquisition is 541710, with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted; full and open competition is anticipated.  An award in excess of $500K to a large business will require a sub-contracting plan prior to award.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to mediate concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions. The Ombudsman does not participate in proposal evaluation or contractor selection.  The Ombudsman can work with responsible acquisition officials to respond to concerns, but will not detract from the authorities of the Project Manager or Contracting Officer.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain the confidentiality of sources.  The Ombudsman at Phillips Research Site is Mr. Eugene C. DeWall, Director of Contracting, Det 8 AFRL/PK, 2251 Maxwell St SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773; (505) 846-4979. Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first refer contracting concerns to the Contracting Officer, F. Tapia at (505) 846-5021, or refer technical concerns to Dr. Troy Meink, the technical point of contact.  The Government does not intend that Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) use privileged information or access to Government facilities to compete with the private sector. If an offeror proposes to use a FFRDC at a lower tier, other than DOD-sponsored FFRDCs in the capacities discussed in DFARS 235.017, it must provide rationale in its proposal that supports the unique capability of the FFRDC.  Also, the Offerors proposal shall demonstrate that the FFRDC can accept work from other than the sponsor.  Offerors are put on notice that non-government advisors may be used.  The non-Government advisor support will be provided by Aerospace Corporation.  Offerors with objections to this shall follow the procedures in 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV 1998).  Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with AFMC FAR Supplement 5335.016-90 and should be valid for a period of 120 days.  Proposals will be due no later than 31 January 2002.  Awards are anticipated within 60 days after proposal receipt.  The proposals will be evaluated by a peer or scientific review process in accordance with the following evaluation criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1) The overall scientific approach and technical merits of the proposal to include, but not be limited to, (capabilities, related experience, and techniques or unique combinations integral to achieve objectives) 2) Importance and applicability to the SBL Program; and 3) Availability of Funds.  No further evaluation criteria will be used.  Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government.  Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Proposals sent to any inappropriate address are ineligible for award.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to pay for proposal preparation cost.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or to any other contract.  For contracting issues, please contact Ms. Susan Alley at (505) 846-4945.  For technical issues, please contact Dr. Troy Meink, (505) 846-9331.  Note 26 applies.

<ARCHDATE>03222002
<CONTACT>Tim  Boyd, 916-557-5226
<DESC>NA Pre-advertisement Contractor Meeting, proposed dredged material off-loader contract.  Description:  The Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project (HWRP) will restore approximately 1,000 acres of former Hamilton Army Airfield to tidal and seasonal wetlands.  The  project site is located adjacent to San Pablo Bay, City of Novato, Marin County, California.  Dredged material will be transported to the site to develop the wetlands.  It is estimated that 10.6 million cubic yards of dredged material will be placed at th e site from 2002 to 2009.  The dredged material will be from Federally authorized operations and maintenance projects and the Port of Oakland  50 foot Deepening Project.  Dredged material from various permitted public and private dredging projects may als o be placed at the HWRP.  The combined annual total estimated quantity of dredged material to be transported to the HWRP could range from 1.5 MCY to 4.1 MCY.  The Corps is considering various contracting alternatives to accomplish this project.  An evaluat ion is being made of the benefits and acceptability of diesel versus electric shore power for the off-loader equipment operation.  Also, consideration is being given to having some of the pipeline and power supply equipment installed prior to issuance of t he off-loader contract to shorten the off-loader contract mobilization time.  Some of the potential alternatives are as noted herein.  Other phases of the HWRP are currently in the planning and design phases.  With the large quantity of pipe required the C orps of Engineers is considering the FY-02 issuance of an initial supply contract solicitation to acquire or acquire and install, approximately 24, 000 feet of 24 to 30 diameter pipeline that will run from the anticipated dredged material off-loader loca tion to the HWRP outboard marsh crossing.  The estimated cost is $1.5M to $3M.  It is anticipated that a construction contract solicitation will e issued early FY03 for the mobilization and operation of a dredged material off-loader and associated plant, p ipeline, power supply, etc.  The off-loader and associated equipment shall be capable of handling dredge material delivered by scows or hopper dredges.  This solicitation may be for a base period of one year with potential subsequent option years.  The max imum contract duration will likely be five years.  It has not yet been determined if this solicitation for providing and operating the off-loader will be issued as an RFP or IFB.  This procurement would be on a continuing contract basis with a potential es timated initial contract amount of $10M.  The estimated total HWRP cost is $60M.  The off-loader is planned to be located in San Pablo Bay at a location with water depths of 27 MLLW.  The dredged material will need to be pumped a distance of 26,000 to 34 ,000 to the HWRP site.  The contractor will likely be responsible for HWRP site operation, including material distribution, water quality compliance, site dewatering, site monitoring, and other associated activities.  Additionally, the contractor may be r equired to accomplish restoration site dredged material cell construction and other earthwork, such as levees and berms.  The Corps of Engineers will conduct a pre-solicitation meeting on February 20, 2002, 10:30 a.m. to furnish contractors interested in t his work with a preliminary overview of the HWRP, anticipated scope of contracts and schedule.  The meeting will be held at 425 Market Street, Room 309 San Francisco, California.  Contractors are encouraged to comment on the proposed contract schedule, req uirements, and other issues of concern.  This can be done either at the meeting or by subsequent written comments.  A brief description of the project and supplemental details will be furnished to those firms requesting this information.  Please direct all  requests to Ms. Linda Hales, Chief, of Contracting, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 333 Market Street, San Francisco, CA   94105.  Telephone number is (415)977-8 553.

<DESC>The Materials Reliability Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST)requires double vacuum melted AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, to be used to produce precisely machined, heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens.  These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the calibration of Charpy V-notch machines, so the specimens (and the steel) must be of the highest quality possible.  The American Society for Testing and Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.  The steel shall be of a single heat to minimize compositional and microstructural variation in the final products.  Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities) we have tried to add some flexibility to this contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased: 7,000 to 10,000 pounds.  We prefer to purchase 10,000 pounds.  The bids will be evaluated on a price per pound basis and delivery time will be considered.  Thirty-two weeks after receipt of order is considered to be a reasonable delivery time.  Compositional Requirements:  The steel shall be produced using a double vacuum melting procedure (vacuum induction melt-vacuum arc remelt).  The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE alloy 4340.  The steel shall also meet the stricter requirements of AMS 6414, which describes steel production by a vacuum melting procedure.  In addition we desire the phosphorous, sulfur, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and copper contents of the steel to be as low as possible.  The maximum concentrations (in wt.%) allowed for the following elements shall be: P=0.010, S=0.005, V=0.030, Nb=0.005, Ti=0.003 and Cu=0.35.  The composition shall be certified using standard analysis procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment shall be calibrated by standards traceable to NIST.  The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the vacuum arc remelted ingot before it is processed by forging or rolling.  These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, and shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE 4340, AMS 6414 and the limits on residuals given above.  Deviations between the two measurements (in wt.% between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) shall not exceed 0.020 for C, Si, and Mo, 0.090 for Mn, 0.030 for Cr, 0.040 for Ni, 0.002 for P and 0.001 for S.  The heat shall be processed to 0.50 inch (+0.15, -0.00) square bar.  The corner radius of the finished bars shall not exceed 0.03 inches.  The maximum grain size shall be ASTM number 8.  In other attributes (decarburization, surface condition, etc) the steel shall be suitable for use as 0.394 inch square Charpy V-notch specimens.  The bar shall be normalized at 950 C (1750 F), and hardened to approximately 35 HRC. (We will consider alternate heat treating schedules if a mutual agreement can be reached.  Our goal here is to produce bars with a minimum of large carbides in the structure, the most uniform carbide precipitation possible, and a uniform hardness.) The bar shall be machine straightened (for twist and bow) and shipped in lengths no less than 6 ft and not more the 12 ft. (11 to 12 ft. lengths are ideal).  The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to which portion of the ingot (or ingots) it was processed from.  The bundles shall weigh less than 4,000 pounds, which is the capacity of our fork truck. We consider 1000 lb. bundles to be an ideal size. This material shall be stored outside at the Boulder, Colorado facility for up to a year.  The packaging shall be suitable for this type of storage without degradation of the box or markings.  Since the surfaces will be ground, a small amount of surface rust can be tolerated. It is not the intent of the Government to issue a separate solicitation for this requirement.  Interested sources proposing to supply these items must submit a written qualification statement by fax, clearly establishing capability to meet the above requirements.  Faxed quotes are acceptable and should be sent to 303-497-3163.  Quotes are required by March 8, 2002.  No separate solicitation will be issued.  This announcement/solicitation is being issued in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (NTE $100,000). FAR Clauses in full text are at  http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.  Agency level protest procedures can be found at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/#REFERENCE .

<DESC>NA MARKET SURVEY A. The US Army desires to insert new technologies into the fleet of Small Emplacement Excavator (SEE) vehicles to improve the overall performance of this aging fleet. The purpose of this survey is to aid the US Army in finding potential commercial manufact uring partners to fulfill our need for improving the SEE. We are looking for proposals to improve the SEE in its current configuration. B. The SEE vehicles have a front loader and a rear excavator. The SEE requirements include the capability of lifting, loading and construction operations. These tasks and operations include, but are not limited to, loading sand, and aggregate into Army dum p trucks and aggregate bins, as well as excavating consolidated earth, digging, and trenching operations.   C. Important capabilities of the SEE include the areas of mobility, stability, and maintainability. The SEE requires transported by air, ship, and highway, as well as being air-drop-able from a C141 or C130. The SEE must be capable of being transported by helicopter (load under 16,450 lbs.). The SEE must have a minimum highway travel speed of 40 mph on the first three roads classification outlined in FM 5-33 Terrain Analysis: all weather, hard surface, dual/highway; all weather, hard-surface highway; and al l-weather, loose-surface highway. The SEE shall also be capable of working on rough, soft, unimproved ground and the last two road conditions outlined in FM 5-33: loose-surface highway; and cart track at reduced speeds safe to operator. The Army is interes ted in improved SEE suspension system, to provide the vehicle the maximum stability possible. Currently the SEE has one, if not the only manual transmission remaining in the Armys fleet, making it a potential training/support cost driver.  D. Identify the area(s) of improvement you are addressing. Please provide as much information on your proposed improvement(s) and experience as possible to include, be not limited to the following:  &#61623; Vehicle Area(s) subject to improvement(s) &#61623; Your plan(s) for that improvement(s)?   &#61623; Logistic support (i.e. repair parts, manuals, and training) that you can provide? Logistics supportability is a critical requirement for this system.  &#61623; The (estimated) time frame for providing this improvement?  &#61623; Cost (estimate) associated with the improvement?  &#61623; Experience you have at this type of application?  &#61623; Your experience with the SEE vehicle?  &#61623; Also please provide manufacturing plant location, and production rates of the component(s)/ part(s) (current and maximum).   E. Any supplemental information concerning the performance, human factor engineering/safety, reliability/maintainability, etc., of your product or any other literature concerning your companys warranty program, production longevity, and reputation that wo uld be useful in your proposal.

Users and administrators must be able to access and make full use of the IMP system through Microsoft Windows (9x, NT, 2000, XP) platforms via TCP/IP.  It must provide SAA operations staff with centralized, but secure, top-level administration.  A central IMP system administrator should be able to monitor the flow of e-mail through the IMP system and should be able to administer each office?s configuration in order to analyze and correct problems.  Detailed information about e-mail activity, IMP system status, and processing errors should be maintained in IMP system or application log files.  The IMP system should be capable of sending notification via e-mail or pager when errors or significant events occur. IMP system software upgrades should be able to be completed without requiring reinstallation of each office?s configuration.  Although SAA operations staff must have administrative access to the entire IMP system, at no time should office-level administrators or users have access of any sort to the data and resources of another office, or to the top-level administrative components of the IMP system.  The IMP system must be able to function without third-party monitoring or intervention, e.g., of the software provider?s support staff, in order to diagnose/correct problems or perform maintenance.  Knowledge of the IMP system must be transferred to Senate staff through training and consultation.  After the initial setup and training, Senate staff should be sufficiently prepared to maintain and support the IMP system. Message format: The IMP system must be able to accept messages forwarded in SMTP format from the Senate?s pair of Sun E450 Internet mail servers, which run Sun Internet Mail Servers (SIMS).  Alternatively, it may pull SMTP-formatted messages from POP mailboxes located on the SIMS servers.  The IMP system must also be able to forward messages in SMTP format to other systems for further processing.  Volume:  The IMP system must be capable of processing 5 million inbound messages per month and of sending 3 million outbound messages per month.  The volume per Senate office varies greatly depending on the population of the state.  Keyword-filtering:  The IMP system must be able to filter on message headers, i.e., From: field, Subject: field, and text, including the ability to filter messages that do, or do not, contain a specific keyword or phrase.  The IMP system must be able to process messages in different ways, depending upon the criteria they have met during the filtration process.  Such processing must include, but should not be limited to: sending an e-mail acknowledgment or response, deleting messages, holding messages pending further processing manual intervention, notifying a user that messages are awaiting further action, printing messages, forwarding messages to e-mail accounts outside of the IMP system.  
Semantic analysis: The IMP system must employ advanced semantic (linguistic) processing techniques to facilitate accurate handling of constituent messages while minimizing the amount of user-processing time required to send out an appropriate response, categorize, or otherwise process an incoming message. Responses:  The IMP system must be able to generate responses based upon the results of the filtration and/or linguistic processes.  It must allow for the creation of ad-hoc responses.  It must be capable of sending responses in SMTP format. Auto-notification: The IMP system must allow for creation and use of multiple auto-notification messages that correspond to keyword filters.  By auto-notification, we do not mean an auto-response mechanism that uses sophisticated linguistic-processing techniques, although that is an option we might pursue in the future. Attachments:  The IMP system must be able to process and store messages while keeping file attachments intact and accessible.  It must also permit the deletion of file attachments. Storage: The IMP system must be able to store filtered and analyzed messages, grouping them in accordance with the criteria the messages have met during the processes of key-word filtration and semantic analysis. Processing Multiple Messages at Once: The user interface must allow large groups of messages to be processed through a single action rather than through several repetitive, time-consuming routines.  It must give users the ability to group and act upon messages that share certain characteristics (such as, but not limited to: subject, from address, sent date, received date, keywords, results of semantic analysis). Actions must include, but not be limited to, sending a response, deleting, archiving, reassigning to another user, reassigning to a different keyword or semantic category, forwarding, closing, printing.  Printing: The IMP system must be able to print messages, both individually, and in bulk, based upon the criteria the messages have met during the key-word filtration and semantic analysis processes.  It must enable individual Senate offices to send bulk print jobs to the Senate?s high speed laser printers.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis-- The U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting a market survey to seek information and to determine the interest from private industry in providing Acquisition Support Services and Acquisition related Information Technology support. 
The federal acquisition community (including both the information technology/CIO community and the procurement community) has been subject to significant reform initiatives over the past several years. These reform measures such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), as well as the more recent Presidential and OMB directives to increase the use of performance-based contracting techniques have significantly changed the federal government?s approach to acquiring goods and services. Many federal agencies are having difficulties fully understanding and implementing these reform measures and streamlining practices and procedures. There is a shortage of experience and expertise in effectively implementing acquisition reform measures.
DOC/OAM seeks statements of qualifications from firms who provide a broad suite of acquisition support services, Information Technology, Business Development, and Performance Based Contracting, with an emphasis on innovative and aggressive steps to plan, control, and manage acquisition functions that are not inherently governmental in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  This not only includes innovative ways to manage existing contracts, but also innovative ways to acquire new or additional resources. 
A Statement of Opportunities (SOO) will be made available via FedBizOpps within the next two weeks to contractors interested in this project.  The SOO will provide data which vendors can use to understand the organization's functions in terms of purpose, scope and volume.  Vendors will be asked to submit solutions  which offer the greatest potential benefit to DOC/OAM, by outsourcing to a commercial entity.  If it is determined that there is no productivity or economic benefit to U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management resulting from the outsourcing of this activity, this acquisition may be cancelled, with the functions being retained in-house and performed by Federal employees.  No payments will be made to contractors for expenses incurred in this survey and submittal process.   
THERE IS NO SOLICIATATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for any information solicited. Close date will be determined with the issuance of the Statement of Objectives.

If for some reason the meeting must be postponed, interested parties who respond to this notice will be notified by phone or e-mail.  This is an IDIQ five-year effort to support  research, development, enhancement & sustainment of the TERC including measurement, data acquisition, analysis, control, & computer systems used for the measurement & analysis of experimental turbine engine components  Due to increased security on base, all participants must send the following information to one of the points of contact listed above for each person attending the conference by COB 26 FEB 2002:  Company Name, Individual Name, Title, Business and Home Addresses, Business Phone and Fax, Business E-mail, and statement that individual is a U. S. Citizen.  A tour of the facility is also planned.  Due to limitations of space on the tour, all participants may not be able to go on the tour.  The fax number is (937) 255-4255.  The procurement is unrestricted (not set-aside).  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.  A brief background and scope of the program follow. The primary mission of the Turbine Engine Research Center (TERC) is to analyze and evaluate the aerodynamic and aeromechanical performance of advanced turbine engine components. To meet its mission, the TERC conceives, develops, operates and manages technology that:  Provides high quality data necessary to document performance;  Develops and applies state-of-the-art measurement techniques;  Develops, modifies and integrates advanced analytical tools in support of test requirements  Acquires, verifies, analyzes, manages and presents acquired data.  The objective of this contract is to research, develop and apply techniques, methods, software and hardware for the measurement and analysis of aerodynamic and aeromechanical parameters of experimental turbine engine components and to insure the operational readiness of the TERC measurement, data acquisition, analysis, control, and computer systems.  Facilities that are currently part of the TERC are:  COMPRESSOR RESEARCH FACILITY (CRF):  A compressor under test in the CRF is driven by one of two 30,000 horsepower synchronous electric motors coupled by a gearbox system that can drive the test compressor at rotational speeds of up to 30,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Computer control and/or monitoring of all systems allows detailed study of the test compressor through immediate data analysis.  Drive motor speed, electrical power conditioning, inlet valve positions, discharge valve positions, and variable test compressor geometry (e.g., variable vanes, bleed valves) are all digitally controlled.  Test article lubrication, drive motor lubrication, actuator hydraulics, service air, cooling water, and auxiliary air systems are controlled by programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  The control system uses CAMAC hardware with 500+ analog input channels sampled at 100Hz per channel, 32 analog output channels, 48 digital input channels and 48 digital output channels. The computer systems are DEC alpha computers using the VMS operating system. The control software is primarily custom FORTRAN with some C  code.  The primary Test Article data system uses VXI hardware with 1500+ channels of analog input sampled at 60Hz per channel. Data acquisition is handled by an NT system using modified Kinetics Systems Visual Basic and C++ code. The online data reduction, display and data storage is handled by a DEC ALPHA using VMS running custom FORTRAN code.  The Aeromechanics data system is a UNIX system running custom C++ code and is used to acquire and process dynamic data (strain gage, high response pressure transducers, etc).  The data acquisition and control systems are tied to a common IRIG-B clock.  Additional software features allow pre-test development of a Test Article Data Base tailored to a compressor's unique requirements and post-test data playback for data analysis, reduction and display.  TURBINE RESEARCH FACILITY (TRF):    The TRF is a short duration test apparatus used to conduct aero-thermal investigations of phenomena relating to turbine components (primarily rotor and vane assemblies) The TRF contains all the support hardware, software and instrumentation required to run tests on advanced turbine designs..  The facility consists of a large tank filled with heated, pressurized gas, an evacuated test section, and two large evacuated dump tanks.  The test section is comprised of a turbine rotor section, which is spun up to a predetermined speed by an air motor, and then allowed to coast for a few seconds.  At the test speed, a valve is opened, allowing the pressurized test gas to flow through the test section that contains the spinning test rotor and on to the dump tanks.  The tests have a duration of two-to-five seconds.  The turbine rotor's speed during the test is regulated and subsequently brought to rest by an eddy current dynamometer.  Facility health data is acquired throughout spin-up, test and spin-down.  Performance data, currently derived from 400 temperature, pressure, speed, torque and heat flux sensors, are acquired during the two-to-five seconds of blow-down.  Current data system capabilities allow sample rates of up to 1 MHz. Data acquisition is handled by an NT system using modified Kinetics Systems Visual Basic and C++ code. The online data reduction, display and data storage is handled by 2 SUN SOLARIS UNIX Systems running custom LabView and C code.  COMPRESSOR AERO RESEARCH LAB (CARL):  The CARL is used to investigate turbine engine compressor aerodynamic performance.  The test facility is powered by a 2,000 horsepower drive motor.  The facility is unique in that it is operated in a closed-loop fashion using state-of-the-art instrumentation and measurement systems that permit on-line precision calibrations of all steady-state pressure and temperature sensors.  The facility may be operated over a speed range of 6,000 to 21,500 RPM and a flow range of 15 to 65 lbs/sec.  Current standard instrumentation capabilities include:  100 temperature sensors, 160 steady-state pressure sensors, 32 channels of up to 280 kHz direct digital recording, parallel analog recording of up to 26 channels, and 4 active tip-clearance devices.  Both fixed and traversing instrumentation capabilities exist.  Laser-illuminated flow visualization techniques, Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDV), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) also exist.  TURBINE ENGINE FATIGUE FACILITY (TEFF):  The primary mission of the TEFF is to investigate High Cycle Fatigue phenomena in turbine engine blades and disks. TEFF testing fills a gap between material coupon testing and actual engine system testing.  The research focus is on the growth of cracks in actual engine components when subjected to realistic stress scenarios induced by servo-hydraulic test frames and electro-dynamic shakers. Full-scale testing of turbine engine blades and disks using advanced analysis techniques such as Laser Vibrometry and Optical Rotation/De-rotation can also be accomplished.  FLOW RESEARCH LABORATORY (FRL).  The FRL supports TERC programs.  It is used to calibrate inlets, probes and other instrumentation devices and systems used in the CRF, TRF and CARL.  This facility is also used to develop and optimize advanced non-intrusive instrumentation techniques, such as laser and hot wire anemometry systems to measure the detailed flow field within turbine engines.   TURBINE ENGINE WIND TUNNEL RESEARCH FACILITIES.  The two cascade facilities are used to explore boundary layer control on low-pressure turbine blading at simulated Reynolds numbers.  The facility can operate at velocities up to 180 ft/sec, and turbulence levels up to 20%, with desired turning angles.  The physics of secondary, transitional and separated flows are investigated and boundary layer control techniques are being researched.  Key to the effective research performed in these facilities is the rapid prototyping of experimental turbine blades. TURBINE ENGINE FLAT PLATE RESEARCH FACILITY.  This facility is used to research the flow physics related to boundary conditions such as turbulence intensity levels and scales along with heat transfer measurements, to evaluate turbulence models and enhance computational fluid dynamics related to turbines.  The primary test unit consists of a two-foot by ten-foot flat plate section with electrical heating capability plus a five-foot unheated starting length, with zero pressure gradient.  Air is supplied at a maximum of 200 fps by a wall jet with interchangeable nozzles for shaping the flow.  The flat plate is equipped to investigate film cooling application techniques.  This unit is also used for flow visualization using laser sheet lighting, with and without cooling jet interactions. Two additional low-speed, two-dimensional, high turbulence units are available for leading edge or stagnation area film cooling research. These two additional units are used to research the effects of pressure gradient on film cooling with high turbulence levels.  Film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer coefficients are determined by transient liquid crystal or thermographic phosphor techniques.  Other advanced instrumentation includes three-component and two-component laser anemometry systems, two color Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system for instantaneous 2D velocity measurements, three-component hot wire system, and high accuracy and precise spatial resolution arrays of 80+ thermocouples along the plate sections.  AEROSPACE FUELS RESEARCH COMPLEX - This facility provides the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to fuel cutting edge propulsion technology. By combining chemistry, computer skills, and hands on technology,  the Fuels Research Complex is creating more powerful, more affordable, and more environmentally friendly fuels for all aircraft and spacecraft needs.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SBA PROPOSES TO INCREASE SIZE STANDARD FOR PETROLEUM REFINERS
<DESC>The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to modify the small business size standard for petroleum refiners for purposes of Federal Government procurement.  SBA proposes to increase the capacity component of the size standard from 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 155,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd); to define the capacity measure in bpcd; and to measure a refiner's total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation Capacity.  The proposed revision is a better definition of the size of business in this industry that SBA believes should be eligible as small refiners for Federal procurement programs.  SBA published the proposed rule in the Federal Register on Tuesday, February 12, 2002.  Comments are due to SBA by March 14, 2002.  The Proposed rule can be downloaded and/or viewed at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html.

Small Business Administration (SBA) adjusted its monetary-based size standards, (e.g., receipts, net income, net worth and assets) for the effect of inflation.  This action is intended to maintain the value of size standards in inflation-adjusted terms.  From 1994 to the third quarter of 2001 the general level of prices in the United States increased approximately 15.8% as measured by the chain-type price index for gross domestic product.  This change will restore eligibility to firms that may have lost small business status solely due to the effect of inflation.  SBA is also adding a provision in its regulations that will require, at least once every five years, an assessment of the inflationary impact on monetary-based size standards.  This periodic review will generally ensure that monetary-based standards are current with inflationary factors, as appropriate, and that firms will not lose small business status due solely to the effect of inflation.

For the purposes of Federal procurements, this rule applies to solicitations, except for noncompetitive Section 8(a) contracts, issued on or after February 22, 2002.  For the purpose of noncompetitive Section 8(a) contracting actions, the new size standards are applicable to offers of requirements that are accepted by SBA on or after February 22, 2002.

SBA published this change as an interim final rule in the Federal Register on January 23, 2002.  Comments to the interim final rule are due to SBA by February 22, 2002.

The interim final rule can be downloaded and/or viewed at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html.

<SUBJECT>A -- Opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)
<DESC>DATES:  Interested parties should submit their proposals to the Technology Transfer Branch of the NCI no later than March 15, 2002.  The proposal should address the selection criteria listed in this announcement.  CRADA proposals submitted thereafter may be considered if a suitable CRADA Collaborator has not been selected.  Note that this is not a contract solicitation.  NIH will not provide funds to Collaborator for research pursuant to this CRADA, inasmuch as the U.S. Government is prohibited from contributing funds to non-Federal parties under a CRADA, under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710(a)(d)(1)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is the anticipated joint agreement to be entered into with the CIT and the NCI pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987 as amended by the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act of 1995.  The CIT and the NCI are looking for a collaborator to further develop and integrate systems for the TELESYNERGY? program.  The proposed term of the CRADA can be up to five (5) years. 

The principal goal of this CRADA is to further develop and enhance the software for the TELESYNERGY? MCWS that will support collaborative networks that are dedicated to the successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases.

The CIT at the National Institutes of Health has developed software for the TELESYNERGY MCWS, a multi-media medical imaging and high-speed networking infrastructure, which functions within an electronic imaging environment, to facilitate professional collaboration and education concerning cancer research protocols and clinical cancer care.

The TELESYNERGY MCWS consists of off-the-shelf components and computers that function using CIT-designed and developed software.  The software is the principal component of the TELESYNERGY MCWS and is subject of development for this CRADA opportunity.

TELESYNERGY has been designed to provide for the simultaneous high-resolution display of images from numerous medical modalities, in both real-time and store-and-forward modes, as well as for the simultaneous interaction of medical experts and other research professionals.

One example of implementation of the TELESYNERGY environment is underway within the Radiation Oncology Sciences Program (ROSP) in the National Cancer Institute.  ROSP's initial applications are in
the areas of research participation in radiotherapy planning and treatment, and the related subsequent clinical and research interactions and collaborations.

Potential areas of application for the TELESYNERGY platform include oncology, general medicine, family practice, and specialties such as OB/GYN, cardiology, nuclear medicine, radiology, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, dermatology, urology, cytogenetics and pathology.  Further development of this system will ultimately bring expanded participation in NCI clinical research and eventual improvement in clinical care to urban and rural health care systems both nationally and internationally.

The TELESYNERGY system functions by transporting audio and video data streams continuously through a 155 Mbits/sec ATM network and/or 1.5 Mbits/sec ISDN telephone link connecting the NCI and national and international sites.  Microphones and speakers allow bi-directional voice communication, and video capability is provided with S-video cameras and monitors.  As stated above, if ATM capability is not available or is too expensive at a remote site, an ISDN PRI circuit can be utilized for connectivity, with only minimal degradation in audio and video quality.

Two high-resolution monochrome image display systems each function as an Electronic View Box (EVB) for the display of 14 x 17 inch format digitized "electronic films."  Utilizing the EVBs, discussion, diagnosis, or organ and lesion contouring can be performed via a shared-cursor technique in consultation mode, which allows the oncologists tocollaborate in identifying features.  These identified regions-of-interest are transmitted simultaneously and in real-time, as is audio, during the TELESYNERGY consultation session.

A remote-controlled microscope capability allows biopsy specimens to be discussed and manipulated by a number of sites concurrently.  In addition, a patient exam camera allows high-resolution viewing of patient exams, including identification of dermatological lesions, skin coloration, and other physical characteristics during a patient examination.  The TELESYNERGY environment also includes a mechanism to allow remote consultations and education between geographically distributed medical specialists of all types.

The CIT and the NCI are seeking a CRADA partner to collaborate with them in the further development, commercialization, education, installation and maintenance of the TELESYNERGY MCWS.  The CRADA, with the intellectual assistance of the CIT and the NCI, would provide systems development and integration of the TELESYNERGY environment for the applications mentioned above. The communication infrastructures utilized to support the TELESYNERGY environment may be ATM, ISDN, and/or other planned, low-latency, secure Broadband networks.

All future software developments and improvements, realized under this CRADA, will provide a user environment similar to, and compatible with, the current version of the TELESYNERGY MCWS software, to as great an extent as is feasible.  This includes interoperability with the peripheral devices utilized within the current version of the TELESYNERGY environment.

Under the present proposal, the overall goal of the CRADA collaboration will involve the following:
1.	Expanding and enhancing the current technology and its usage, as developed by the CIT and the NCI, regarding the TELESYNERGY MCWS.
2.	Providing programming support for the broad commercialization/dissemination of the TELESYNERGY System, and enhancement into other medical disciplines.
3.	Developing a distribution and service plan for the TELESYNERGY System.

PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS:
The roles of the CIT and the NCI in the CRADA may include, but are not limited to:
1.	Providing intellectual, scientific, and technical expertise and experience to the research project.
2.	Providing the CRADA Collaborator with information and data relating to the methodology currently implemented within the TELESYNERGY MCWS.
3.	Publishing research results.
4.	Developing additional potential clinical applications for the TELESYNERGY system.
 

The roles of the CRADA Collaborator may include, but are not limited to:
1.	Providing significant intellectual, scientific, and technical expertise or experience to the research project.
2.	Providing programming support for writing novel software, and technical support for writing system manuals.
3.	Providing technical and/or financial support to facilitate scientific goals and for further design of applications of the technology outlined in the agreement.
4.	Publishing research results.

Selection criteria for choosing the CRADA Collaborator may include, but are not limited to:
1.	A demonstrated record of success in the development and dissemination of a medical or scientific software application.
2.	A demonstrated background and expertise in ATM, ISDN, and Broadband network technology.
3.	The ability to collaborate with the CIT and the NCI on further research and development of this technology.  This ability will be demonstrated through experience and expertise in this or related areas of technology indicating the ability to contribute intellectually to ongoing research and development.
4.	The demonstration of adequate resources to perform the research and development of this technology (e.g. facilities, personnel, expertise, and funding) and to accomplish objectives according to an appropriate timetable to be outlined in the CRADA Collaborator's proposal.
5.	The willingness to commit best effort and demonstrated resources to the research and development of this technology, as outlined in the CRADA Collaborator's proposal.
6.	The demonstration of expertise in the commercial development and production of products related to this area of technology.
7.	The willingness to cooperate with the CIT and the NCI in the timely publication of research results.
8.	The willingness to accept the legal provisions and language of the CRADA with appropriate modifications pertaining to the software-based technology sought to be developed.  These provisions govern the distribution of future rights to intellectual property developed under the CRADA.
