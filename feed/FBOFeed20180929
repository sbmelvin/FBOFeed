Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing/repair knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition/repair of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing/repair knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets the qualification requirement(s) at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The TRICARE Management Activity, which reorganized into DHA, initially procured the software license in January 2003.<br /><br />Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and clinics conduct root cause analysis for patient safety events and other risk evaluations. Root cause analysis is essential to preventing recurrence of undesirable outcomes by identifying and correcting the root causes, rather than addressing symptomatic results. Use of a single root cause analysis tool across all MTFs and clinics improves the exchange of information on patient safety incidents. No third party vendors are authorized to resell TapRooT&reg; software maintenance agreements, certify instructors, or use System Improvements materials to deliver training courses. <br /><br />Contractors not solicited under this requirement may submit a capability statement for future consideration. However, the Government still intends to award "Sole Source" under the procedures at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Soliciting from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.

QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATOR (QAE) SURVEILLANCE PLAN
INTRODUCTION:
This QAE Plan has been developed for in-house operations or to implement a service contract.  It is designed to aid the Government's QAE in providing effective and systematic surveillance of all aspects of laundry services.  This plan provides for monitoring all contract requirements through a combination of methods.  These are:
Sampling guides
Customer complaint surveillance guides; and
Surveillance activity checklist.

The objective of this surveillance plan is to evaluate how the Government or Contractor is performing in key areas.  We are primarily interested in the final product or service being provided and not in the details of accomplishment.
The principal method of surveillance will be the random sampling of the quantity and quality of laundered items processed.  The plan contains sampling guides for use in random sampling.  It contains random sampling (tally) checklists which are used to record information about the random samples.
Tasks not surveyed by random sampling will be covered by daily observation in some cases or by use or periodic checklist inspections.  Appropriate checklists are provided for recording observations in this type of surveillance.
HOW TO USE THE SURVEILLANCE PLAN:

This surveillance plan has been organized to facilitate use by the QAE.  It is the QAE s responsibility to develop a monthly schedule for activities based on the surveillance plan s requirements.  The monthly schedule will be completed by the last workday of the preceding month and a copy will be submitted to a CO or other management official for information and review by an assigned workday of the month.
To build the inspection schedule, the QAE will select areas and times for the random sampling using the procedures shown in the surveillance plan.  Periodic checklist items to be surveyed during the month will be programmed into the schedule to facilitate their accomplishment.  This monthly schedule should show what the QAE is monitoring each day.  Changes will be posted weekly and copies sent to appropriate officials.  The reasons for changes will be fully documented and explained.  Actual surveillance activity must be comparable to the monthly schedule.  The responsible management official must be able to observe a QAE s performance by using the monthly schedule, as updated.  One should be able to conduct a complete audit trail from the monthly schedule by observing the QAE perform sampling or other checklist surveillance, and completion of tally and other checklists.  An auditor should be able to track from the above items to the management s actions (payment deductions or other actions as necessary if contract service is being performed), described on a CDR.
Monthly tally checklists will be prepared for each sampling guide and will be used to record information on observations and defects.  Each observation in the sampling will be recorded on the tally checklists.  These documents will then become a formal record for later reference.  The tally of observations and defects at the end of each month will be compared to the acceptable number of defects appearing in the relevant sampling guide.  Any errors detected during the course of the surveillance, even if not of sufficient degree to render the service unsatisfactory in terms of the AQL parameters, will require corrective action by the VA for in-house operations and the Contractor for contracted services.  Errors detected by the QAE in the course of surveillance will be transmitted to the Contractor or in-house management for correction.  Notification of errors will take place within 1 working day.  Specifics concerning any errors should be recorded on the tally checklist.  The Contractor or in-house management, as applicable, should be asked to initial this record.
If the sampling guide indicates that the number of defects is too high, the current month s service will be considered unsatisfactory.  If performance in any area is judged unsatisfactory, based on random sampling or other criteria as set forth in Summary Table 7.3.1. Performance Requirements Summary, of the Laundry Performance Work Statement, a Contractor or in-house management official will be given a CDR by the COR.  When completed and signed, the CDR, along with the tally checklist becomes the documentation supporting payment or nonpayment or other actions as necessary for contractor provided services.
There are some requirements in a contract which are more conveniently monitored on an individual periodic basis.  For example, a Contractor or the Government is required to provide continuing training.  When these items are checked (quarterly and monthly, for example), the deficiencies will be recorded on the appropriate checklist.  When these items are discovered to be unsatisfactory, actions as described above will be taken.  For the number of allowable defects, see the Performance Requirement Summary in the PWS.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY METHOD OF APPLICATION: 
The Contractor is required to perform all the work specified in the performance work statement.  If the contractor fails to perform a specific element of the work, payments for the task in question will be subject to reductions as specified.  Any amount deducted for deviation from the required performance will be reflected in an amount commensurate with the task.

The purpose of this section is to:
List the contract requirements considered most critical to acceptable contract performance.
Show, where applicable, the maximum allowable degree of deviation from perfect performance for each requirement that shall be allowed by the Government before contract performance is considered unsatisfactory.  This is known as the AQL and represents the level of quality required in a VA run operation.
Show the percentages of the major elements of the contract price that each listed contract requirement represents.
Explain the quality assurance methods the Government will use to evaluate the Contractor s performance in meeting the contract requirements.
The Government s quality assurance procedures are based in part on statistical random sampling of the recurring critical output products of the contract using the criteria in MIL-STD-105D.  Other areas will be reviewed periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annually).

CUSTOMER COMPLAINT SURVEILLANCE GUIDE:  The checklists attached hereto contain those contract requirements that can best be monitored by the individual or activity receiving the service.
At the start of the contract, the QAE shall instruct customers on the requirements of the contract and on the proper method to complete the customer complaint form.  A written copy of the specific contract requirement will be provided to each customer.  Customers shall be required to submit the complaint form within 1 working day of the discovery of the discrepancy.
Once each year, the QAE will contact each customer to assure that there is an understanding of the contract requirements.  The QAE will document the annual visits.
When a complaint is received, the QAE will contact the customer to verify the complaint.  If the complaint is valid, the QAE will notify the Contractor of VA management whoever is applicable of the defect in writing.
The QAE will retain the complaint form in the files.  At the end of each month, all validated complaints will be tabulated to determine satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance, in each are, based on the criteria in the AQL column in the  Performance Requirements Summary.
