The intended outcome of the RFQ is the issuance of a single-award, firm-fixed price purchase order to the responsible quoter offering the best value.
The Government intends to evaluate quotations and issue a purchase order based on the initial quotations received. Therefore, the quoter’s initial quotation should contain the quoter’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Award of the contract resulting from this RFQ will be made to the responsible quoter whose quote is technically acceptable, in full compliance to all other requirements set forth in the RFQ, and the lowest price determined to be fair and reasonable.  To be considered technically acceptable the quoters must complete Attachment 1 and be able to provide the services requested at the location(s) indicated in this solicitation to include Attachment 1. The Contracting Officer will rank quotes from lowest to highest price and review the technical quotes of the three lowest priced quotes first.
 If the lowest priced quote is technically acceptable and can meet all of the requirements identified in Attachment 1, then upon a fair and reasonable determination an award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.

This solicitation will close at 2000 hours (8:00PM) Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on 26 February 2019.  All quotations shall be submitted to Robert Dunn via email at Robert.dunn@navy.mil by the solicitation closing time listed above.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.  The quoter will provide a quote in response to the terms of the solicitation and the final contract award will be based on a determination of responsibility and lowest price.
