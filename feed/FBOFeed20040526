<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Automation of MSFC Material Contamination Team SOC400 Analytical System. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item from ATK/Thiokol Propulsion, Inc., Magna, Utah, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  ATK/Thiokol Propulsion is the only known source with the proven knowledge and experience to automate the SOC400 Analytical System remotely.  This will enable MSFC to remotely participate from Marshall Space Flight Center in the development phase of the Marshall Material Contamination Team automation project and provide critical input during the design phase, while collaborating with individuals at the contractor's site, on a real-time basis.  In addition, the current system configuration requires one individual (usually a scientist) full-time to operate the SOC 400 system.	Automation of this system will allow this individual to initiate a test and concentrate on other efforts during the effort.  A typical test with 128 data points which would currently require this scientist to be available to push a button at 128 intervals will now require him to be available only one time, freeing him to do other more important tasks. 2.  ATK/Thiokol Propulsion has prior experience with automating similar systems for the U.S. Air Force located at Hill AFB, Utah. Development costs and lead time will be greatly reduced as a result of their previous experience. 3.  Extensive market research over the past two years has revealed no other vendor with the knowledge and capability to perform this effort and with a willingness to release the source code at the completion of the project.  In addition, an attempt which was made to work an agreement with Oak Ridge National Labs for other federal agencies with possible similar needs proved unsuccessful.   The government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 4, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

A.  INTRODUCTION
The OSD Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Office has established a Tri-Service project to develop a versatile, safe and environmentally friendly water-impact marking capability to serve the test and evaluation needs of advanced munitions development programs. This project, identified as the Soft Impact Location Capability (SILC), will provide a modular, portable system to support full-envelope testing of advanced ordnance systems using shallow-water ocean impact areas in lieu of traditional land-impact ranges. This approach locates ordnance impact areas safely away from land areas, but in modest water depths that enable post-test recovery of the projectiles. When required by individual test objectives, the in-water impact location capability will be augmented by above-water instrumentation for measurement of projectile angle-of-incidence and attitude.  
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) seeks information on the availability of technology needed to enable satisfaction of the functional and performance requirements established for the SILC in the specific areas of (1) acoustic splash marking and (2) angle-of-incidence measurement. 
Proposals shall describe all steps necessary to design and develop a system that will meet the performance objectives described herein and shall include an initial prototype and in-water testing that preferably can be completed by the end of January 2005.  
B.  SILC CONCEPT AND GOALS
1.  To achieve a versatile, portable capability that can serve users in numerous geographic locations, the SILC design concept consists of a group of acoustic, electronic, and mechanical subsystems, all transportable by sea, land or air. The SILC system will be self-contained and require no support aircraft, recoverable targets, or external data communication links. Deployment and recovery of the in-water acoustic splash marking and angle-of-incidence measurement subsystems will be accomplished by existing range craft available on both coasts of the CONUS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Hawaii. The test location may be any convenient open water area having depths up to about 100 meters (30 meters to enable post-test round recovery); capability to operate in deeper water is a desirable performance enhancement. In each case, the SILC-instrumented impact area and supporting subsystems will be oriented so that the system under test can be fired or launched with an acceptable hazard pattern. The munitions systems under test may be launched from land, sea or airborne platforms at ranges out to 1000 kilometers. The minimum size of the instrumented impact area will be 300 meters cross-range by 800 meters down-range.
2.  The principal SILC objective of highly accurate in-water munition splash marking will be realized by using an in-water impact location subsystem consisting of multiple independent moored acoustic sensor stations. The number and arrangement of these stations is variable, depending on the needs and objectives of specific test users and the hydro-acoustic conditions present in a given test area. Each station will be self-powered and data-linked to an off-range processing and control facility, located either ashore or afloat at a safe distance from the impact area. Additional stations carrying an above-water angle-of-incidence measurement subsystem will supplement the acoustic impact location subsystem, and will also be data-linked to the off-range processing and control facility. For both sensor subsystems, the allocation of unique processing functions between the in-water stations and the off-range facility is left to the subsystem designer. The two sensor subsystems, together with the processing, communications, control and display, and deployment and recovery subsystems, constitute the complete SILC capability. 
3.  The SILC conceptual design features short-term in-water deployment periods, a limited number of in-water nodes, and RF data linkage between the in-water stations and the dry-end subsystems aboard the support vessel or ashore. These features will enable simpler, lighter-weight in-water components, and will contribute to simplification of the demands placed on the deployment and retrieval subsystem. The design concept also supports complete assembly or reconfiguration of each measurement station, including physical integrity and electrical performance testing, on the deck of the support vessel prior to deployment. A very precise Government-developed survey methodology will be employed to ascertain the exact location of the deployed acoustic sensors.  Using Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational data, the precise geographic location of the angle-of-incidence sensor stations can be determined as a final step prior to each test event and inserted into the measurement and tracking software. However, it is an objective that during actual testing the stations operate satisfactorily in the presence of GPS jamming.
4.  The maximum allowable weight of both acoustic measurement stations and angle-of-incidence stations, i.e. when configured for use in the deepest water (100 meters) of the system design envelope, is 225 kg each. This moderate weight can be easily deployed and retrieved using equipment commonly installed on existing range craft, such as cranes, winches and U-frames. 
5.  In-water sensor stations will be constructed in a manner such that the risk of damage in the field will be minimized, but if damage should occur, components will be field repairable/replaceable. Durability of all components will be such that numerous deployments and recoveries are possible over the SILC life span (at least four deployments per year for 10 years). The stations must be field-configurable for deployment in water depths from 12 to at least 100 meters.  All material to be placed in the water must be retrievable, with the exception of non-hazardous-material anchors.
C.  ACOUSTIC SUBSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The following functional and performance requirements apply to the acoustic subsystem of the SILC. This sensor subsystem will be integrated with Government-developed signal and data processing components to satisfy the impact splash marking requirements established for SILC.  A modular in-water acoustic sensor station design is desired that supports all of the following specific requirements: 
1.      Impact location accuracy of 5 meters or better over a minimum surface area of 300 x 800 meters (when used in conjunction with a suitable number of similar sensor stations and processed by a Government-furnished processing subsystem). The objective location accuracy is 1 meter. 
2.      Sensor position determination at time of test article impact to within 3 meter accuracy (when subjected to precise Government-furnished survey prior to test operations). The objective accuracy is 1 meter.
3.      Capability to detect and locate the splash points of at least four near-simultaneous impacts

The proceedings will provide valuable information about the sensitivity of aggregate used in pavement to moisture.  This issue is of concern to State DOTs across the country.  It is important that the information discussed at the workshop held in February 2003 be disseminated to those in the paving industry.  As a co-sponsor of this event, TRB is a sole source of this service.  The FHWA contact for this requirement is Arla Cotton, telephone number (916)498-5010, or Sarah Skeen, telephone number (916)498-5023.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about June 10, 2004.

<DESC>General Information<br><br> Contracting Office Address<br> 	ESC/NIK 5 Eglin Street, Bldg 1624 Hanscom AFB, MA<br><br> Description<br> The Family of Interoperable Operational Pictures (FIOP), Task One, Integrated Product Team (IPT) 1.1, Web Enabled Execution Management Capability (WEEMC) Project Office; Electronic Systems Center, Enterprise Services and Applications Directorate (ESC/NI2) intends to issue an RFP for development of the WEEMC mission application Increments 3, 4 and 5. The purpose of this notification is to solicit qualification information from offerors. <br><br> The WEEMC RFP will solicit proposals for Increments 3, 4 and 5 of the multi-phase Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) - directed project. The anticipated Period of Performance will be FY05 - FY08 inclusive although follow-on phases may approach FY '09.  Total contract funding through FY09 is expected to be $25 million - $40 million.  The Government Statement of Objectives will include requests for operational capabilities analyses as well as system and mission application interface reviews; system engineering, architectural design, code development, and test.  Contractor support for baseline integration as well as software sustainment, fielding, network and hardware installation, security accreditation and certification is also required. <br><br> As a follow-on to the current Automated Deep Operations Coordination System "ADOCS - Like," Increment 2 effort, WEEMC, Increments 3, 4 and 5, will focus on those tasks required to effectively create WEEMC as an "ADOCS - replacement." As a result, WEEMC, Increments 3, 4 and 5 will not only provide enhanced web-enabled access to multiple databases and functional capability to a myriad of geographically-separated Joint warfighters to expedite requests for Joint Fires; but also, capability to support Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions.   In addition, Weapon Target Pairing (WTP) interfaces will be addressed as well as interfaces to Tactical Data Interface Links, et al. <br><br> The current 18-21 month, Evolutionary Acquisition, Spiral Development contract consists of 3 spirals resulting in one software increment targeted for the Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) and Global Command and Control System - Joint integrated baselines.  The Increment 2 mission application reflects only a subset of the currently defined WEEMC requirements.  The planned acquisition for 3 one year Increment deliveries (3, 4, and 5) will build on the Increment 2 baseline with at least 6 additional spirals covering 36 months from contract award.   Source code for the Increment 2 baseline will not be available until delivered under the current on-going development effort.  Delivered software increments (3, 4, and 5) will be targeted for the Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) and Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) integrated baselines while mitigating risk for integration into other Programs of Record.  Although only three incremental deliveries are planned for fielding the Government will reserve the right to field any spiral delivery should the added capabilities be needed by the warfighters.  The aforementioned functional capabilities will interoperate within underlying network centric enterprise architectures and provide thick, thin, and ultra-thin client versions.  WEEMC will adhere to COE I&RTS specifications while achieving level 7 compliance. <br><br> Qualification summary requirements: The offerors shall prepare a qualification package to be submitted 22 June 2004.   The package shall be limited to 6 pages.  All documentation provided shall be directly pertinent to the business unit bidding for the WEEMC increments 3, 4 and 5 work package.  Justifications shall demonstrate the business unit's capabilities with specific examples accompanied by supporting documentation. <br> The following qualifications areas shall be addressed: <br> 1)	The offerors must be at a minimum SW/CMM level 3 compliant in the business unit that shall perform the WEEMC incremental development. <br> 2)	The offerors must be totally familiar with the existing Automated Deep Operations Cooordination System (ADOCS) ACTD functionality to include the technical architecture. <br> 3)	The offerors must have extensive development experience with web based applications using J2EE, SOAP, XML and commercial development best practices. <br> 4)	The offerors must demonstrate in-depth understanding of the functionality and technical architecture of TBMCS and GCSS-J.  Work history and examples demonstrating technical competence in developing applications for and meeting the integration requirements for these systems must be provided. <br> 5)	The offerors must show evidence of a complete understanding of the Common Operating Environment (COE), Integration and Runtime Specification and Network Centric Enterprise Services architecture. <br> 6)2)	The offerors must show an understanding of the Joint Fires, Time Sensitive Targeting, Combat Search and Rescue, Weapons-Target Pairing, and Tactical Data Interface Link operational requirements areas within the context of the Theater Air-Ground System utilized by today's Regional Combatant Commanders. <br><br> THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. QUALIFICATION IS TO MINIMIZE RISK TO THE GOVERNMENT AND STREAMLINE SOURCE SELECTION ACTIVITIES. <br><br> Original Point of Contact<br> Michael Cunningham, Contract Negotiator, (781)377-0462 or Kent Kinal , Contracting Officer, (781)377-1273<br> Email Questions to michael.cunningham@hanscom.af.mil<br>  See Note 26.

<DESC>This solicitation will be available at http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about June 10, 2004 with a proposal opening date of approximately 45 days following issuance.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUESTS OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Description:  Dry Dock 1 Repairs, Boston National Historical Park, Charlestown Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts.  Solicitation Number N1720040408. This project will repoint/regrout 12 rows of granite blocks and repair the concrete stairways in Dry Dock 1 in the Charlestown Navy Yard. As an additive option, additional concrete work may be included at stair 1.  Dry Dock 1 was completed in 1833 and is arguably the oldest extant dry dock in the country. It is on the List of Classified Structures. It is 400 feet long and 60 feet wide at grade level, and approx. 30 feet deep. The USS Constitution was the first ship repaired in the dry dock and it was again repaired in Dry Dock 1 in 1995-96. It remains in active use. Pressure grouting is needed to fill voids behind the granite blocks to prevent movement from freeze/thaw cycles and to prevent leakage through the dry dock walls. This project would also repair the concrete steps which are the access down into the dry dock. They have deteriorated badly from weathering and exposure to salt water and are a safety hazard.  Dry Dock 1 is a National Historic Landmark. The National Park Service anticipates entering into a firm fixed-price construction contract as a result of this solicitation.  This acquisition is subject to P.L.100-656, Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and as such is open to all concerns regardless of size.  The NAICS code for this project is 237990 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million.  The contract performance period is 120 calendar days following Notice to Proceed.  In accordance with FAR Section 36.204, the estimated price range for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000.  Contractors are urged to make a site visit to ascertain existing work conditions.  A pre-proposal conference will be held on Wednesday June 30, 2004 at 10:00AM, further details will be described in the solicitation.  All interested offerors are encouraged to attend.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement from IntraMalls LLC; 120 Cockeysville Road, Suite 204; Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030, for CIT to use the NIH IntraMall and provide the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The NIH IntraMall represents an innovative, full-service acquisition system that harnesses the power of the Internet to streamline the Federal procurement process for the NIH scientific community.  This pioneering e-commerce acquisition system provides product information, on-line ordering, and sophisticated accounting and budget functions that are all customized for the Federal acquisition community.  The NIH IntraMall is able to satisfy the researcher’s equipment and supply needs while saving time and money with every purchase transaction.  Having been tested and implemented for use in 1998, the NIH IntraMall is currently being used by approximately 13 NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).  Growth of vendors and products offered by the NIH IntraMall has been considerable, with over 150 vendors and over three million catalogue items currently included.  The NIH IntraMall program has empowered the NIH scientific community to exert direct control over purchases of needed supplies and equipment with a substantial decrease in the administrative processing costs per purchase transaction.  The NIH has partnered with IntraMalls, LLC since 1996 to develop and expand the NIH IntraMall software platform, making it a model for digital end-to-end e-commerce by integrating procurement card-based purchasing and seamless transaction information between buyers and sellers.  The NIH IntraMall includes the following features:  electronic ordering, payment, and automated record keeping; a revolutionary automated reconciliation module; and the integration of each purchase transaction to the NIH legacy accounting system (the NIH Administrative Data Base).  Services provided by the NIH IntraMall software platform developed by IntraMalls LLC include hosting and maintenance of supplier catalogues, online shopping and transaction processing, automated purchase order/funds reconciliation, ad-hoc reporting, and toll-free customer support.  Representing a business-to-government (B2G) solution, the NIH IntraMall program has essentially converted supplier catalogues into convenient procurement vehicles, and performs more efficient managed procurement support services that has enabled NIH to reduce its cost of procurement.  Within the IntraMalls LLC software functionality, the process of procuring through the NIH IntraMall is defined as end-to-end, beginning with comparative shopping and ending with receipt, payment and reconciliation.  The software functionality transcends e-catalog connectivity by tightly integrating shopping and requisitions with the order and payment processing services necessary to fulfill audit purposes.  CIT has a need to establish a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement with IntraMalls LLC to allow CIT to acquire the same end-to-end, web-based vendor catalogue, order delivery and account reconciliation system services currently being used by other NIH ICs, or to extend the IntraMall program to other agencies.  Specifically, the services will include (1) access to over three million catalogue items from over 150 existing vendors; (2) standardized, searchable electronic catalogues comprised of scientific, office and computer equipment and supplies; (3) catalogue descriptions that include NIH-specific pricing and financial classification codes; (4) complete vendor support including enrollment, training and catalogue formatting services; (5) management of user profile data including purchase card and shipping location data; (6) automated order delivery system for interactive communications and order monitoring; (7) custom built interface for delivery of transaction and billing data directly into the NIH accounting system; including an automated reconciliation function; (8) toll free help desk for users and vendors; and (9) activity reporting for users and NIH IC management.  The software platform used to operate the NIH IntraMall program was developed by and is proprietary to IntraMalls LLC.  The software functionalities provided by IntraMalls LLC in its Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement are unique in their ability to meet all current Federal and NIH documentation requirements for purchase card transactions.  Additionally, IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary software is the only source that provides the ability to integrate purchase transactions from the NIH IntraMall into the existing NIH accounting system (an internally programmed legacy system).  Because of the characteristics of the NIH legacy accounting system and IntraMall LLC’s proprietary ownership of the software integration solution, building a new interface to another e-commerce platform would require a substantial investment of time and effort that would simply duplicate what has been achieved by NIH to date in partnership with IntraMalls LLC.  Additionally, NIH is in the process of replacing its legacy accounting system within the next 24-36 months; therefore, making an additional investment in the legacy system is impractical.  Duplicating the unique software functionalities available from IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement would not be financially prudent.  Finally, if NIH were to compete for a new integration effort, it would immediately lose the important benefits of (1) CIT’s use of the existing NIH IntraMall solution and its labor-saving features developed by IntraMalls LLC; e.g., automated transactions and billing data reconciliations; and (2) the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ).   However, all interested parties may request an RFQ by contacting Lynn Montalvo Furtaw at 301-496-6546.   Sources interested in responding to the RFQ must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above and in the RFQ.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-143/LMF shall be cited on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Montalvo Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or by email at: montalvl@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination  not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The solicitation number is PM4053 and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0M to qualify as a small business.   The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle  Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing and distributing Teflon filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The Teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM-2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal  2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.   EPA obtains the filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  The Teflon filters will  be shipped from the manufacturer, to the Agency, in one lot packed in sets of 50 filters per container in suitable clear hard dust-tight non-contaminating plastic.  The contractor shall then either pick up or arrange for the delivery of the filters from the Agency storage facility in Research  Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The contractor shall test 350 filters from the batch of Teflon filters provided by the manufacturer, where a batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, specified by the PO for acceptance testing by the physical and chemical test described in the  statement of work.  Filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the states.   All 350 filters shall be subjected to visual inspection tests and then a certain quantity shall be subjected to other tests described in the statement of work.  If the  acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the filters to the state/local air pollution control agencies as specified by the EPA.  The contractor shall distribute approximately 267,000 filters to the  state/local air pollution control agencies as soon as the testing has been completed and the filters are determined to be acceptable to EPA.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends on acquiring for Device 15F8H Serial Number 4, Contractor Turn-Key Support (CTKS) for the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 Weapons Systems Trainer (WST), from 24 July 2004 through 30 September 2004 located at Naval Station Norfolk, VA.  As the Government does not, and will not, timely possess an accepted and validated technical data package to pursue a competitive acquisition strategy, it intends on pursuing a sole-source acquisition strategy to NLX Corporation, Sterling, VA.  NLX Corporation is currently tasked under contract N61339-99-C-0084 to design, develop and fabricate a Hawkeye 2000 WST (Device 15F8H Serial Number 5) which is a follow-on to Device 15F8H S/N 4 and providing Contractor Turn-Key Support. However, the Device 15F8H Serial Number 5 tasking is inclusive of the design, development and integration of the full Hawkeye 2000 configuration whereas the Device 15F8H Serial Number 4 tasking does not possess these enhancements. This undertaking will retrofit the enhancements into Device 15F8H Serial Number 4.  All questions and information should be directed to Contract Specialist, Linda Hill, via email at linda.a.hill@navy.mil or by phone 407-380-4107.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>1.  Eglin Air Force Base published a sources sought synopsis (SSS) 17 March 2004 seeking sources capable of providing solutions in new and leading edge emerging technologies for state-of-the-art dictation and medical transcription services.  As a result of this SSS market research tool and our own market research, Eglin is considering a set-aside restricted to Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003.   The standard North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code is 561410 with a small business size of $6M.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Eglin is interested in a SDVOSB contractor capable of developing a plan to phase in these new technologies in a manner that is least disruptive to the critical requirement for medical staff to dictate medical records and have timely transcription services.   The contractor shall provide all voice input dictation devices and transcription services for a staff of approximately 130-200 health care practitioners with potential for more practitioners later.  Medical services range from primary care to cardiology, orthopedics and neurology, to radiology and more.    The dictation system shall have 24-hour capability for providers to review, edit, and replay anytime prior to transcription and have a secure web-accessible server for storage and retrieval of transcribed provider dictations.  Radiology transcriptions must be performed on site using the Government’s Lanier Digital Voice Dictation/Transcription System with input directly into Composite Health Care System (CHCS).   The Government will provide office space and computers for up to 7 on-site personnel; a minimum of four positions must be performed on-site in the Eglin hospital.  
       
2.   Interested SDVSOB sources are requested to provide a (1) statement of current capability to provide state-of-the art dictation and transcription equipment and the following additional information:  (2) company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and type and business size indicating whether you are a small or large business for purposes of the assigned NAICS; (3) past experience information in providing dictation hardware/software and medical transcription services such as but not limited to a list of three of your most relevant and recent DOD or commercial contracts; (4) information telling us about your company and why you think you can perform this contract.  Limit your response for this market survey to a total of 8 pages.  In order to be considered in this SDVSOB market survey, responses are required not later than close of business 9 June 2004.   Only responses received by this date will be considered in determining the method of acquisition.  If it is determined that an SDV set-aside is not in the best interests of the Government, the solicitation will be issued as a SB set-aside.  Telephone responses are not acceptable. Submissions can mailed, faxed to (850) 882-4916 or e-mailed to  carmella.noll@eglin.af.mil.  Because of the limited time, e-mail is encouraged.  Address: DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, Building 350, 5th Floor - AAC/PKOBB, 205 West D Ave., Ste. 541, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6862.   NOTE 29.

<DESC>This is an additional market survey to the one published as 283-04-0092 in FedBizOpps on April 29, 2004.  This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to this 541511 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. 

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and MUST respond to the following questions: (1) Does your firm qualify as a small business under the NAICS code? (2) Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business under the NAICS code? (3) If disadvantaged, under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? (5) Are you considered a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned business? In addition, the respondent MUST provide a capability statement that addresses the organization’s qualifications and ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.

The Office of Applied Studies (OAS) was established in October 1992, when the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) was reorganized as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). OAS serves as SAMHSA’s focal point for data collection analysis and dissemination activities.  Data are collected on the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse, as well as on the adverse health consequences associated with substance abuse. OAS also collects data on the nation’s substance abuse treatment system and on the characteristics of individuals receiving substance abuse treatment. These data are intended to serve as statistical indicators of progress in the field and to enable a better understanding of the nature and extent of substance abuse, in order to improve prevention and treatment services and to reduce substance abuse and mental illness.

In addition to discrete studies, OAS maintains several major data systems:

(1) National Survey On Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); (2) Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN); and (3) Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS) – which includes the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and the Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS).

Each of these data systems routinely generates new data sets. However, internal SAMHSA resources devoted to analytic work are sufficiently scarce that external assistance in analysis and dissemination must be sought. For example, the NSDUH (funded under a separate contract) produces routine estimates of drug use nationwide, at the state level, and for various sub-populations. Nevertheless, the vast array of data collected during that survey cannot all be analyzed under the primary contract, nor are there sufficient in-house resources available to mine the data sets assembled under that activity. Therefore, external assistance to produce reports highlighting more focused concerns (e.g., drug use by women or adolescent females) is highly desirable.

The central purpose of this contract will be to increase the utilization of SAMHSA databases both internally by SAMHSA staff and externally by university-based and other researchers and policy makers, thereby increasing the knowledge and understanding of alcohol, drug abuse and mental health disorder and the nature and impact of these disorders throughout the country. The support services provided under this contract will enable OAS to increase its dissemination of analytic data and other products and promote knowledge about the fields of substance abuse and mental health.

Statistical, logistical, administrative support, and consultant services are required to support the scientific and technical mission of OAS, SAMHSA. Specifically, the contractor will be required to provide:

(1) Analytic support -- Provide OAS staff with a full range of analytic support, including statistical programming assistance, statistical analysis, preparation of analytic data reports for both internal and public use, and consultation on statistical and analytic methods such as regression analyses, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), variance estimation, and other statistical and methodological tools. It is anticipated that this task will require approximately the following staffing: Seven (7) Ph.D. statisticians (including one (1) applied mathematician who can also do statistics); two (2) Ph.D. epidemiologists; three (3) Ph.D. economists (including one (1) econometrician); and six (6) Ph.D. analysts, to be available on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis. The staff working on this project will be required to have extensive, comprehensive experience in mental health and substance abuse treatment.

(2) Analytic Data Preparation -- Provide OAS staff with a full range of support, including programming assistance, clean-up, preparation of analytic data files for both internal and public use, and consultation on statistical and analytic methods such as regression analyses, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), variance estimation and other statistical and methodological tools.  It is anticipated that a combination of approximately six (6) Ph.D. data programmers and analysts will need to be available on a full-time basis. These personnel will be required to have extensive, comprehensive experience in mental health and substance abuse treatment.  

(3) Literature Searches, Technical Writing and Editing -- Support the scientific literature requirements of OAS with reviews, annotated bibliographies, technical writing and technical editing assistance on such document projects as original analytic data reports and papers, reprints, etc. Provide searches of governmental and non-governmental databases available on the Internet, from universities and other public sources, and from commercial data base vendors for scientific and technical information. Develop written products for dissemination to policy makers, special interest groups, and the general public. It is anticipated that a combination of approximately six (6) editors and technical writers will need to be available on a full-time basis. These personnel will be required to be at the master’s degree level or higher, and have extensive, comprehensive experience in mental health and substance abuse.

(4) Logistics Support -- Provide travel, lodging and meeting support for approximately six (6) expert panels to guide analytic activities, as well as for workshops, conferences and other meetings scheduled by OAS (or attended by OAS staff or designated individuals). Obtain topical experts for 1-day meetings, etc. It is anticipated that one (1) FTE staff person will be needed for this task.

(5) Presentations -- Support OAS speakers with slide/overhead/computer graphic presentations of analytic data and other charts and graphs and graphics support pertinent to the Office mission. It is anticipated that one (1) FTE staff person will be needed for this task.

(6) Project Management -- Provide appropriate and responsive direction to the contract. It is anticipated that two (2) FTE senior-level personnel with extensive, comprehensive experience in mental health and substance abuse will be required for this task.

This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to: Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Program Services, Division of Contracts Management, 5600 Fishers Lane, Parklawn Building, Room 13C-06, Rockville, MD 20857, Attn: James Whitt; or by facsimile to (301) 443-0019. Telephone and e-mail responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received in writing, by no later than June 9, 2004, 3:00 PM, local time.  

No solicitation is currently available. Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list, or a request to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reference 283-04-0092A.

<DESC>I. Background:  Under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and a number of Executive Orders, the Federal government has demonstrated its resolve to promote the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles, to clean up our environment, and to promote the goals of reaching energy independence and security. The U.S Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Clean Cities Program is designed to encourage the use of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs), promote fuel-efficient vehicles and procedures, and support the development of fueling infrastructure throughout the nation. The Clean Cities program takes a voluntary approach to alternative fuel use and efficient transportation technology deployment, working with coalitions of local stakeholders to help develop interest and support and to integrate this commitment into larger planning processes. Clean Cities works directly with local businesses and governments, guiding them through each step in the process of building the foundation for a vibrant local organization, including goal-setting, coalition-building, and securing commitments. Current and potential members of the Clean Cities network also help each other by sharing local innovations "mayor-to-mayor," by addressing and relaying obstacles they encounter in pursuing alternative fuels and fuel-efficiency programs, and by exchanging "do's" and "don'ts," based on experiences in these programs. DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Center for Transportation Technologies and Systems (CTTS), plays a key role in DOE’s Clean Cities Program by providing technical information, tools, and other resources to help Clean Cities Coalitions implement their AFV and fuel efficiency deployment plans. To be effective in providing services to the Clean Cities stakeholders, NREL must possess on-site, or have at its disposal, technical expertise in a variety of areas pertaining to alternative fuel, fuel blends, and fuel-efficient transportation deployment.  These areas include: fuel efficient practices/technologies; fueling infrastructure development; light/medium/heavy-duty AFV availability and applicability; local/state/Federal government processes and legislation assessment; determination of emissions benefits; overall implementation planning; and resolution of specific problems relating to these areas.  Current focus is on transportation activity centers such as airports, mass transit, school districts, local governments, or light/medium/heavy-duty delivery fleets to improve the penetration of alternative fuel use and implementation of fuel-efficient technologies.  These niche markets represent a wide variety of vehicles and applications that will, conceivably, accelerate the rate at which alternative fuels, fuel blends, and fuel-efficient technologies (including vehicle idle reduction) are incorporated into the transportation mainstream, if successful projects are demonstrated and local fueling infrastructure is expanded.  However, some locations have experienced difficulties with the implementation of alternative fuels because of technical issues or other problems that have arisen.  NREL, managing the Clean Cities Technical Assistance (Tiger Team) Activity for DOE, provides assistance to the various Clean Cities in the alternative fuel, fuel blends, and fuel-efficient transportation implementation processes and provides focused problem resolution, with both direct participation and subcontracted efforts from technical experts in the stated areas.   II. Objective:  In order to assist the large number of Clean Cities that currently participate in the alternative fuel, fuel blends, and fuel-efficiency implementation program, it is necessary that NREL enlist the services of individuals or organizations who have demonstrated expertise in specific transportation-related areas. Therefore, NREL, through this Sources Sought request, is seeking individuals or organizations that have the required practical expertise and communications skills to provide technical advice and assistance to Clean Cities Coalitions who are trying to implement alternative fuels and fuel-efficient technologies within local fleets. This includes assistance in establishing the alternative fuel infrastructure, which will ultimately lead to widespread community acceptance and use.  The individuals or organizations responding to this Sources Sought will be identifying themselves as potential respondents to a subsequent Request for Proposal for Clean Cities Technical Assistance (Tiger Team). The technical assistance providers will help to resolve technical problems and issues related to alternative fuels, fuel blends, alternative fuel vehicles, refueling stations (identifying generic, not brand-specific, solutions wherever possible), idle reduction, hybrid vehicles and other fuel efficiency technologies and practices. They will assist in cultivating the necessary partnerships and cooperation among key stakeholders who are interested in expanding niche market opportunities for alternative fuels, fuel blends, or fuel-efficient technologies. III. Areas of Expertise: Individuals or organizations (I/Os) responding to this Sources Sought request must describe capabilities, attributes, and skills in one or more of the following specific areas of expertise in which alternative fuel, AFV implementation, and fuel efficiency assistance can be provided.  The I/O will also identify that area of expertise in the cover page of its submission.  A) Implementation planning and technical assistance for fuel efficiency, alternative fuel, and fuel blend use in fleet vehicles (i.e., hybrid, electric, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, ethanol blends, biodiesel blends, hydrogen, hydrogen/natural gas blends, idle reduction) for: 1) Airports (aircraft servicing equipment and customer transport to/from airport); 2) Local/city/regional transit bus systems; 3) School bus fleets; 4) Local government fleets; 5) Cargo delivery vehicles (light, medium, heavy-duty); 6) Personal transportation.  B) Alternative fuel and fuel blend station design, cost estimation, and implementation technical assistance (compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, ethanol blends, biodiesel blends, hydrogen, hydrogen/natural gas blends, electric).  C) Alternative fuel, fuel blend, fuel efficiency, and idle reduction feasibility analysis, identifying short and long-term cost benefits and investment payback periods.  D) Assessment of local/state/federal policy or legislation for AFV and fuel-efficient vehicle benefits (petroleum displacement, emissions, economic, and energy security impacts).  E) Evaluation of transportation emissions on local/regional air quality.  F) Emergency preparedness analysis for energy security.  G) Assistance of coalition stakeholders in interactions with local and state organizations, fuel providers, municipal planning organizations, etc.  H) Development of technical tools, training aids, and educational materials. IV. Response:  The response to this sources sought document is limited to 8 pages of single spaced text of 12-point Arial font or equivalent, with minimum 1” margins all around. Brevity is encouraged.  Any organization interested in working with NREL to provide the technical expertise described within this document should mail a list of qualifications, based on the Areas of Expertise listed above, to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Attn:  Kathee Flanagan Roque, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1632, Golden, CO 80401-3393.

<SOLNBR>SSC-San_Diego_MKTSVY_1DB5A
<RESPDATE>063004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Oralee Martin, Contract Specialist, 619-553-5347
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and/or Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC SD), Navigation and Applied Sciences Department (Code 230) is the Navy Technical Liaison to the Border Research and Technology Center, a specialty center under the National Law Enforcement Technology Center effort, a program of the National Institute of Justice.   SSC-SD is also supporting the Department of Homeland Security in several technology development activities.  These tasks require experience with law enforcement, first responders, and corrections agencies, and a working knowledge of these agencies operations and personnel.   Since several of these projects are executed within San Diego County or along the international borders, a familiarity with both the agencies and their procedures is needed to properly execute these projects. DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to identify potential sources that are interested in responding to a future solicitation for efforts involving research, development, and technology transfer to public safety and criminal justice agencies.  The anticipated tasking will require a mixture of research development, engineering and experience in law enforcement both as a practitioner and as liaison with law enforcement within San Diego, the border regions, and throughout the US.  Familiarity with law enforcement in the greater Washington D.C. area, the Office of Justice Programs within the National Institute of Justice (specifically the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Centers), and the Department of Homeland Security is desirable.   The tasks will involve interfacing with the San Diego Regional Automated Justice Information Sharing Network (ARJIS), for both information technology and wireless networking, so a familiarity with the personnel, structure, and technologies resident at ARJIS and the participatory agencies is needed. Similarly, a working knowledge of the San Diego-Imperial County Regional Communications System for wireless interoperability will be needed. Liaison with the USBP and other agencies within the DHS Border and Transportation Security Directorate, specifically in San Diego, but also along the Southwest and, less urgently, along the Canadian border, is important.  Knowledge of both technology and procedural requirements of these agencies is needed.   Tasking will require a demonstrated capability for setting up research projects, clearly documenting results through oral presentations and written reports, and organizing projects, seminars, and workshops to disseminate results.   A reasonable knowledge of Navy procedures and organization, particularly SSC-SD, will be needed.  Tasks may include researching and advising on appropriate levels of Navy/DoD involvement in civilian homeland security research effort.  Some projects may involve collaboration with National Guard, the FBI, DEA, and the USCG, so the offeror will have to be prepared to provide support to SSC-SD in developing both technical and procedural requirements and providing effective liaison with these agencies, especially within the San Diego region.   Tasking may include participation within tabletop and field exercises demonstrating domestic preparedness, so liaison within California, such at the Los Angeles TEW, and neighboring states is important.   While specific engineering tasks cannot be defined at this time, the offeror must be prepared to show a history and capability of providing engineering support in the areas of information technology and assurance, wireless communications, as well as technologies of specific interest to law enforcement and first responders, such as less than lethal, CBRN sensors, etc. Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capabilities (SOC) including a technical description of the ground plane sufficient for government evaluation of the system as a candidate alternative solution. Interested offerers must submit an SOC that clearly shows they are qualified to perform the effort and include  (1) physical and functional description of the item being offered (size, weight, and external interfaces); (2) performance specifications of the item;  (3) qualification data, and (5) cost. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ONLY AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST. Future requirements and procurements are uncertain. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement.   All data received in response to this request for information and/or sources sought announcement that is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. The government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of information by interested parties. This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation is not available at this time.   Questions pertaining to this announcement may be directed to the POC, Ms. Oralee Martin at (619) 553-5347 or via e-mail at: oralee.martin@navy.mil The Information Statements are due by 4:00 P.M. local time on 30 June 2004 and should be submitted electronically to the POC e-mail address.  The following information should be included in the submittal: company name and address; company point of contact; company business size - small or large. This synopsis is also posted at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central Website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). Interested parties are encouraged to review the website regularly for updated information.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This sole-source combined solicitation synopsis for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Only one solicitation will be issued and only one proposal will be requested.

This serves as a notice of intent to award a contract on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Corporate Executive Board, 2000 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20006.  This is necessary because it is the only known responsible and responsive source that can satisfy the Government’s particular requirement to maintain a Infrastructure Executive Council for the Defense Logistics Agency.

<DESC>This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines service for the Artesia Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.  The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area.  The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations.  The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times.  The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas:Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.

If there is space available, then any government employee on official travel may provide proper identification and travel orders at the gate and the airline will allow that individual to travel.  The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected.  The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft.  The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 -Evaluation - Commercial Items.  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.  The offeror’s proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements.  Failure to meet this requirement will exclude the offeror from consideration.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerers in descending order of importance: (1) the offeror’s ability to meet the requirements in the SOW; (2) the offeror’s strategy to meet scheduled arrival and departure times given the availability of aircraft, flightworthiness of aircraft, etc; (3) an evaluation of past performance; and (4) price.  Technical and past performance, when combined, is of significantly higher importance than price in this evaluation. The evaluation criteria can be reviewed by contacting Art Welton at 505-746-5782 or emailing him at art.welton@dhs.gov.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is HSFLR040023.  The proposal shall include this number and include a narrative on technical factors 1, 2 and 3 and should provide enough detail so that the Government can evaluate technical performance.

<DESC>This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines service for the Artesia Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes  Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.  The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area.  The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations.  The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times.  The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.

The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected.  The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft.  The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items.  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.  The offeror’s proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements.  Failure to meet this requirement will exclude the offeror from consideration.

<DESC>This combined synopsis solicitation is amended to provide answers to questions we have received. QUESTION:  You are very specific as to what the quantitative analysis requirements are for the Carbon & Low Alloy Steels, Stainless Steels, and Aluminum Alloys. What are your like requirements for Titanium Alloys, Copper Alloys, Nickel bases-------, and Cobalt based super alloys??  ANSWER:  Requirements for titanium etc. are much less defined, as there is not an applicable ASTM standard defining them. We would accept most any level of precision. The others are specific and are taken directly from standard references. QUESTION:  Does the customer have problems in the following areas that the Spectrometer must be able to cope with; corrosion, oxidation, carburizing, nitriding, cladding, etc.?? If the answer is yes, and I have missed some, please state what else must be accommodated.  ANSWER:  We are interested in base metal analysis. We will clean / prepare the samples to base metal so that corrosion and oxidization are not factors. However, carburizing, nitriding, cladding and plating will be encountered during analysis but are not part of the specification. QUESTION:  Does the customer want the Spectrometer to be able to analyze paint on the samples??  ANSWER: Analysis of paint is not part of the specification. QUESTION:  I interpret the specification to say that we must provide one certified standard for each of the named alloy groups, and in addition a complete set of calibration standards, so the user can himself calibrate the Spectrometer for each of the alloy groups. Calibration by the vendor is NOT required. Am I correct?? ANSWER:  Initial setup and calibration by the vendor is required for all alloy types specified. Calibration and alloy standards (which maybe one and the same) are required for continuing validations of calibration.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 4:
Question 1:  What is the specified delivery time after award?
Answer 1:  There has not been a specified time as of yet.  Obviously the sooner the better.  As modifications may have to be done to these units, we will take this time into consideration.  Technical evaluation is more important than delivery time.  Although, for example one month delivery time is far better than a three month delivery time.
Question 2: What type of power connector is needed?
Answer 2:  A twist lock or something that won’t easily slip off.
Question 3:  What is the preferred orientation for the 14” round supply and return collars on the cabinet?
Answer 3:  There is no preferred positioning.
Question 4:  What is the estimated length of the supply and return ducts?
Answer 4:  15 to 20 ft will suffice.
Question 5:  When would the equipment be required for delivery?
Answer 5:  There is no specified delivery time, but the sooner the better.
Question 6:  The 10 amp average draw is low, an efficient 2 ton compressor will draw this much current?
Answer 6:  As I understand it, 400 sq ft equates to one ton.  These units will be used for sleeping tents and on average are 700 sq ft.  Some of the specs might be a little confusing or misleading.  Please use your own best discretion as to the needed amperage for the space to be cooled or heated.
Question 7:  In order to provide a power receptacle on the unit, the power cable must be defined?
Answer 7:  The power cable should have a pigtail end so that it can be possibly hooked into a generator or junction box.
