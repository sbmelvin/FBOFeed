INTRODUCTION <br> Public Law 93-523, which established the Safe Drinking Water Act, was approved and passed in 1974. This Law states that the water purveyor is responsible for the integrity of the water supplied from the distribution system. The intention of the act of 1974 is to designate the water purveyor as the prime entity responsible for the quality of water to the furthest most point, or last free flowing tap of the distribution system. As a result, States and water purveyors have developed backflow programs via ordinances or laws to ensure that drinking water is not accidentally <br> contaminated as it passes through the distribution system. One critical portion of a backflow program is conducting a survey for existing facilities to identify unprotected cross connections. <br> Battle Creek ANGB requires a Comprehensive Drinking Water Cross-Connection and Backflow Prevention Survey. The objectives of this project include the following: <br>   Identify and document unprotected drinking water cross connections; <br>   Determine the cross connection control requirements of the local water purveyor or other applicable <br> regulatory agency; <br>   Identify and catalog existing backflow prevention equipment; <br>   Assess the adequacy of protection, installation, and testability of existing backflow prevention devices; <br>   Enter inventory and survey results into an existing database developed for maintaining backflow <br> devices; <br>   Recommend appropriate backflow prevention devices for unprotected cross connections; and <br>   Develop a budgetary cost estimate for installation of recommended devices. <br>  <br> 2. APPICABLE DOCUMENTS <br> The following documents and sources shall be considered a minimum of documents applicable to this project: <br>   Uniform Plumbing Code, Section 603, Cross-Connection Control <br>   AFI 32-1066, Plumbing Systems <br>   University of Southern California, Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research, <br> Manual of Cross-Connection Control <br>   American Water Works Association, <br>   Any applicable state and local cross-connection control ordinances <br>   Existing base Backflow Prevention Device (BPD) inventory, testing results, or other BPD records. <br>  <br> 3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS <br> 3.1 Meetings <br> A project kickoff meeting, and additional required meetings, will be held between the Contractor, the Technical <br> Program Manager (TPM), and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to clarify all project requirements (may <br> be accomplished by telecon). The contractor shall prepare an agenda and record meeting minutes and action items <br> for all meetings such as base site visit in-briefings. <br>  <br> 3.2 Planning and Preparation <br> Project planning and preparation shall include the development of a draft and final Work Plan and Health and Safety <br> Plan, acquisition and review of a building list, inventory of existing installed backflow prevention assemblies, <br> installation maps, and other applicable documents. <br> A Work Plan and Health and Safety Plan will be developed. The Work Plan will be used as a guidance document <br> for all work conducted under this task order, and shall include an example field survey form, a description of field <br> survey methodology, and data entry procedures. The health and Safety Plan will be prepared to comply with U.S. <br> Air Force and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). <br> Also during the Planning and Preparation task, the contractor will obtain and review preliminary information <br> necessary to efficiently conduct field survey work. This will include a list of buildings, an inventory of existing <br> installed backflow assemblies, and installation maps. <br> The survey form (printed or electronic) to be used by the contractor will facilitate the documentation of the following <br> data while on site: <br>   Building number, <br>   Building name, <br>   Organization, <br>   Cross-connection location, description, and pipe diameter, <br>   Hazard type (health, non-health), <br>   Potential contaminants (when known), <br>   Any deficiencies and recommended corrective action, <br>   Brand name, model number, serial number, and size of any installed backflow prevention assemblies, <br> and <br>   List of digital photographs taken. <br> 3.3 Field Work <br> Field work will consist of conducting a comprehensive drinking water backflow prevention assembly inventory and <br> cross-connection survey. The survey shall follow the criteria established by the University of Southern California, <br> Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (USC FCCR HR) and the American Water Works <br> Association (AWWA). Where applicable, state and local regulations shall take precedence over these organizations. <br> The backflow prevention assembly inventory will identify and catalog existing backflow prevention equipment. The <br> cross-connection survey will identify and document unprotected drinking water cross-connections. Data will be <br> collected using the survey forms derived from the backflow database specified by the ANG. The inventory and <br> survey results will be entered into the backflow database. All cross-connections will be tagged with and ID number <br> and photographed. Digital photographs will be provided to the base on CD-ROM and linked to the database. <br> 4.

The report shall list <br> corrective actions including but not limited to replacement or repairs required for deficient backflow prevention <br> devices, and installation of new devices. <br> 4.3.1 Inventory Results/Database <br> Inventory and survey results shall be entered into a backflow database that the base can use as a management tool for <br> the base cross-connection and backflow prevention control program.
