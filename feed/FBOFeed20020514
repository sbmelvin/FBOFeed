<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply Water Resources Div. (WSWRD), Edison, NJ intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with YSI, c/o NASCO, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This requirement is for the procurement of three (3) Automated Data Logging Units to record chlorophyll, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH/ORP, chloride, ammonium, and nitrate at high temporal resolution.  The automatic data logging   instrument obviates the need for multiple sample collection and manual analysis, reducing the total analytical load and total monitoring costs in the ongoing BMP evaluation projects.  The data generated from these automated data logging instruments must be fully-compatible with data generated from existing equipment in use by the WSWRD.  Having different units would represent a series of QA issues (bias, resolution, accuracy, and precision).  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12, Commercail Items.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 for the updating of its FAR database.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty days  after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The IRS has a requirement for FAR updates for their Integrated Procurement System (IPS).  This system has been in production since 1996.  This system is a customized version of CACI?s Standard Automated Contracting System (SACONS).  The FAR updates are to be provided electronically for uploading into the IRS? Progress database.  The FAR updates are required within a week of a FAC being issued.  Data will be provided in ASCII Text format and formatted as detailed below. 

In order for the Research, Document Generation and Print programs of IPS to function properly, the contractor provided updates must be coded with special characters that these programs can read and interpret.  Each file starts with the clause title.  The title must be preceded by two carats ?^^?.  The title must also be the very first line of the file and be left justified with no spaces between the preceding carats ?^^? and the title.  Double ?@@? symbols denotes that the text following is instructional text to explain when the clause is to be used.  The next block of text is free form and this is the actual text of the clause.  Within a clause you may have fill-in information.  The fill-in information is handled with imbedded codes, which do not print, and are not visible to the user.    Fill-in information can be found anywhere within a clause.  Each fill-in field must be preceded by a 6-position code.  The first two positions are ?**? followed by four digits.  The ** tells the system that fill-in information follows and to reserve a field for this information.  The first two digits may be any two digits; the last two digits determine the fill-in format.  The last two digits indicate whether the fill-in will print out in word-wrap or columnar format.  The values 01 and 99 are used to produce an unlimited number of fill-in lines in word wrap mode.  Values 02 through 98 are used to produce an unlimited number of columnar lines.  Fill-in clauses must also contain a HELP line to aid the user in completing the fill-in information.  Only one HELP line per fill-in entry is permitted.  When creating the HELP line it must; appear above its respective fill-in; be the only occupant of the line; be preceded by the symbol ?%%?; not include any of the clause itself; and be left justified. 

The actual file must appear as indicated  below.  In addition, for proper uploading to the Progress database,  the lines in the files submitted must be no longer than 75 characters.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for three (3) each Joss-Waldvogel Disdrometer 80 Systems, Model Number RD-80.  These systems include: 3 sensors S-80 with 100m cable; 3 processors P-80 with power supply 115/230 ac; 6 sets of styrofoam cones, washers, and o-rings; 3 sets of software for PC; 3 sets of calibration documents; and 3 instruction manuals. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Distromet, LTD, P.O. Box 209, Basel, Switzerland.   Distromet, LTD is the only source that can provide this distrometer that is capable of measuring rainfall parameters.  The disdrometer transmits the mechanical impulse of an impacting raindrop to a set of two moving coil systems.  Voltage is induced in the sensing coil, and the drop is amplified.  The amplitude of the voltage is compressed by signal processing electronics which provides a voltage that is compressed and can be expressed using a function of raindrop size.  A pulse height analyzer sorts the peak amplitudes in 20 channels of diameter drops in the range of 0.3 to ~5.5 mm.  The disdrometer has a 50 cm2 sampling area.  This disdrometer is required to be compatible with existing equipment and required to operate unattended and continuously. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 31, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U. S. Public Health Service (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Association of Health Education Centers
Milwaukee, WI..
 Purpose: As a result of  highly successful mental health curriculum, it is important to share the results with other Health Education Centers throughout the nation so the curriculum can be replicated and implemented nationwide.  NAHEC has developed additional health curriculums that address several Surgeon General Priorities.  We believe those curriculums should be shared so that implementation can occur not only in the Center where the curriculum was developed, but also in Health Education Center curriculums across the country.  Other priority areas include Youth Violence and Bullying and Childhood Obesity (coupled with nutrition and physical activity).

<DESC>The NASA George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) intends to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for upgrading and enhancing an existing operations cost model that incorporates cost data to the manpower and services required for operation launch systems.  The current model includes pre-1994 cost data and does not include all of the system operations elements that contribute to the overall cost.  The update of the cost data, and the upgrade to include all operations costs elements and the enhancement of the model to include the capability of analyzing the effects of technologies and architectures on operations cost will greatly increase its value in supporting the evaluation of conceptual launch systems architects and new technologies. This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 that implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisitions of services from only one responsible source.  General Dynamics Corporation (GDC) developed the Conceptual Operations Manpower Estimating Tool and Operations Cost Model (COMET/OCM) from 1992 through 1994 under contract to MSFC.  The principle investigator and developer of the 1994 model is currently an employee of KT Engineering. Therefore, MSFC intends to purchase the items from KT Engineering.  Competition is impractical because: (a) The KT Engineering employee played a key role in the design, development and validation of COMET/OCM,  (b)  The upgrade and enhancement of COMET/OCM would be accomplished most efficiently by the original developer, with detailed knowledge of the model functions, logic flow and architecture, (c)  As is usual in such model develoment, at least some of the development documentation, such as notes and charts, is not included in a users manual or other standard documentation. (d) The Shuttle and Atlas operations database that supports COMET/OCM will have to be reconstructed from old files, (e)  If another source were given this work, there would be a considerable period of time expended in acquiring knowledge about the model, developing access to new data, reconstructing the database and revising the models with a significant probability that some information could be lost and the model enhancement would be less than optimal, (e) KT Engineering recently developed the COMET/OCM Upgrade Plan by which the modification effort will be guided, which included extensive review of the current model, its integration into the operability model, NROC, and the current use of COMET/OCM/NROC to support conceptual launch system and new technology evaluation and (f) Because COMET/OCM already exists and is currently in use by the Agency, the proposed changes to the model will involve research, development and design in reconfiguration and reformatting, technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition are not available.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. This acquisition is noncompetitive, over $100K and is for noncommercial supplies or services.  See Note 22. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 23, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS for this RFA (Request for Applications) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This RFA is SET ASIDE for State Departments of Transportation (or equivalent).  There is NO INCUMBENT contractor, and no incumbent recipient.  In this RFA, which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) currently estimates will be published on approximately June 14, 2002 in FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov, the FHWA will be seeking Applications for a new Cooperative Agreement to be entitled ?Surface Transportation Security and Reliability Information System Model Deployment.?  The Recipient of that Cooperative Agreement will participate in a model deployment to enhance the security, reliability and safety of the surface transportation system through the widespread availability of real-time information.  That model deployment will examine how surface transportation security and reliability can be improved under the five specific situations or scenarios described below:

1.	Major metropolitan areas ? The collection and dissemination of real-time information on all principal arterials, freeways, major rail and bus systems, and intermodal connectors and facilities to support security management and emergency evacuation and response.   On a day-to-day basis, this real-time information will also support improved congestion management and incident response, enhanced travel time reliability, improved safety and better overall operational performance of the metropolitan area surface transportation system.

2.	Statewide information systems  ? The widespread collection and dissemination of information on incidents, weather events, and other scheduled and non-scheduled lane and road closures that can significantly impact security management and emergency response by reducing travel capacity on major highways.

3.	Security of critical infrastructure ? The surveillance and monitoring of critical bridges and tunnels; major rail and bus facilities; freight and intermodal connectors and terminals; and major hazardous materials and military routes to detect potential security problems, provide alerts and assist in post-event analysis.

4.	Non-metropolitan evacuation ? Traffic and weather monitoring of key roadways or corridors outside of metropolitan areas to support emergency evacuations caused by either man-made or natural disasters.  

5.	Weather response ? The collection and use of road weather information to improve safety and operational response to weather-related events such as flood, fog, snow or ice.  

This model deployment will provide new information and insights on:

?	Innovative approaches and technologies for providing security monitoring and management of critical infrastructure, particularly tunnels, bridges and key intermodal freight and transit facilities.

?	Collection and operational use of traffic and weather data to support emergency evacuation.

?	The data needed to support security management, emergency evacuation, congestion management, freight management, safety management, weather response, and traveler information.  This includes learning about the spacing, coverage, frequency, and mix of innovative and traditional data sources.

?	Innovative approaches and technologies for monitoring and collecting traffic, transit, truck and intermodal freight, weather and transportation security information. 

?	The amount of surveillance or monitoring needed to support improved transportation security and reliability as a function of traffic volumes and geographic area.

?	New institutional arrangements needed for the integration and sharing of data.

The USDOT expects this model deployment to demonstrate today?s best practices, and to foster innovative approaches in the collection, processing, use, dissemination, sharing, and archiving of surface transportation information.  It is important that the model deployment not just demonstrate how best to deploy innovative surveillance, monitoring and data collection systems, but also demonstrate what data becomes available for surface transportation system operations and how such data is actually used to improve transportation security, safety and reliability. 

The U.S. DOT will provide $10,000,000 in funds over a four-year period for this model deployment.   In accordance with statutory requirements (see ?5001(b) and ?5207(d) of TEA-21), the selected State must provide----OVER AND ABOVE that $10,000,000 DOT funding figure----a minimum MATCHING share of 20%, from NON-federally derived funding sources.

The U.S. DOT expects a State Department of Transportation (or equivalent) to be the lead agency (i.e., the PRIME Applicant) for each proposal (i.e., Application) submitted in response to this RFA; but DOT encourages States to establish partnerships with other public agencies (e.g., public safety agencies, transit agencies, etc.) and with private sector companies in responding to this RFA.  The term ?or equivalent?, as used in this announcement, refers to a situation in which a particular state government does NOT have any agency whose NAME is ?Department of Transportation?, but instead has a transportation-cognizant state agency with some OTHER name, such as ?Department of Roads?.  The PRIME Applicant under this RFA CANNOT be a LOCAL transportation agency.

The U.S. DOT expects that the first two years of the effort will be devoted to a combination of design and deployment of the components of the surface transportation information system.  The U.S. DOT, and its representatives, will conduct an evaluation of the operational use of the deployed information system components during the second two years of the effort.

TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THIS RFA WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective Applicants (i.e., offerors) are to obtain this RFA from FedBizOpps, at http://www/eps.gov.  Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFA will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out any HARD copies of any such Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each Applicant to closely and frequently MONITOR FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFA.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFA will be absolutely ESSENTIAL for all prospective Applicants, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.  Please note that the due date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which Applications will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for receipt of Applications will be stated in the RFA.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply Water Resources Div., Cincinnati, OH, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with M.J. Research, Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement is for the procurement of an MJ Base station genetic analyzer.  The instrument shall be equipped with lasers for fluorochrome excitation and with detectors capable of capturing at least four emissions wavelengths per sample.  The Fragment Analysis system shall be controlled by an Intel Pentium III-based-terminator cycle sequencing and automated fragment analysis.  Fragment analysis for 50 samples shall be performed in 2 hours or less.  In addition, this instrument shall be able to generate sequencing data for a minimum of 1000 nucleotide bases, with a DNA sequence error rate of less than 1.5% over 800 bases. The system shall be covered with a two-year warranty and software packages for both DNA sequence and fragment length analyses.  One of the key features of the MJ Base Station analyzer is the fragment analysis software which is the best currently available in the market. Ongoing research has been performed using the MJ Base Station genetic analyzer.  Researchers have acquired in-house expertise for using the system, protocols have been developed and a significant amount of data has been collected. The acquisition of the MJ Base Station will allow comparison of data obtained from previous experiments with data obtained from future studies.  The EPA has determined that the purchase of another, different genetic analysis instrument would seriously hinder on-going projects and affect the Agency's ability to respond to the anticipated need for in-house fragment analysis in support of developing bacterial source-taking protocols.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis,  the National Committee for Quality Assurance(NCQA), Washington, D. C.  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  A one(1) year contract is planned. This contract is a continuation of an effort begun in Fiscal Year 2001.  The NCQA is the only possible contractor that has sole access to its proprietary Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set(HEDIS) and Managed Care Organizations/Managed Behavioral Health Organization accreditation surveys.  The purpose of this contract is to field test a set of performance measures regarding access to behavioral health care services that can be integrated into accreditation standards and national standards for performance measurement.  These measures are critical to the monitoring of access and quality of care regarding behavioral health care services for HRSA-funded provider organizations.  The measures on this topic are currently unavailable and therefore this activity would provide new policy tools to assure the availability of quality behavioral health care for patients seen in public provider settings.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. Cite solicitation #02-OA-058-MC when corresponding. TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED. See Note 22 #02-OA-058-MC

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply Water Resources Div., Cincinnati, OH, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ZAPS Technologies, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This requirement is for the procurement of a Zero Angle Photon Spectrometer.  The U.S. EPA is perusing technology to evaluate anomalies in drinking water quality in distribution systems.  For the past ten years fiber optic instrument zero angle photon spectrometer (ZAPS) technology has been developed for the Office of U.S. Naval Research in order to measure the concentrations of trace substances in the ocean waters. ZAPS spectrometers were the original "smart" sensors.  Unlike most other field instruments the operating parameters are digitally controlled.   Microprocessors built into the instrument make it possible to analyze data in remotely and in real-time and use the results to initiate emergency response action.  This information could be used to screen raw water, treated water, or to provide feedback to utility operators for more efficient plant operation.  The acquisition of the Zero Angle Photon Spectrometer will satisfy agency requirements for research capabilities, experience, engineering, developmental, and expert services that are required to maintain the intellectual property and integrity that is specific to this research.  The EPA will be jointly preparing a patent application with the identified source under the FTTA for the invention and application of the technology to evaluate anomalies in drinking water quality in distribution systems using a zero angle photon spectrometer technology.  There is no other U.S. based source that has this unique combination of technical experience, intellectual property, and laboratory and field experience that can provide this expert assistance.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) awarded contract N01-LM-0-3502 on November 1, 1999, to the University of Pennsylvania, 133 South Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, to assist in the development of an application programmer interface (API) known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK), and first implementation of a Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (SRT).  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate with the University of Pennsylvania on a sole source basis to extend the current contract number N01-LM-0-3502 for twelve months to continue the overall goals of the project, which include streamlining the existing ITK code, improving the consistency of the internal software architecture, extending documentation of the existing algorithms and methods, and generating examples suitable for inclusion in courseware and educational materials associated with ITK.  The University of Pennsylvania is currently providing the required services, and will continue to improve and refine the finite element model support in ITK creating a consistent software architecture across the existing object hierarchies, to improve and refine the fuzzy-connectedness segmentation methods in ITK, to improve and refine the Voronoi-analysis technique used as priors for segmentation by deformable models, and to demonstrate the integration of ITK with visualization and user-interface software through concise publishable examples.  The University of Pennsylvania has been performing the required services for the past two and a half years under the current contract.  This requirement represents a continuation of the services they are currently providing to the NLM.  By virtue of their expertise and experience gained through their development and implementation under the current contract, the University of Pennsylvania is uniquely qualified and the only source capable of carrying out these required services in the required time frame and without duplication of cost to the government and undue delays.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to the University of Pennsylvania without full and open competition is planned.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) awarded contract N01-LM-0-3503 on October 20, 1999, to the University of Tennesse, Office of Research, 404 Andy Holt Tower, Knoxville, TN 37966-0140, to assist in the development of an application programmer interface (API) known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK), and first implementation of a Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (SRT).  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate with the University of Tennessee on a sole source basis to extend the current contract number N01-LM-0-3503 for twelve months to continue the overall goals of the project, which include streamlining the existing ITK code, improving the consistency of the internal software architecture, extending documentation of the existing algorithms and methods, and generating examples suitable for inclusion in courseware and educational materials associated with ITK.  The University of Tennessee is currently providing the required services, and will continue to improve and refine the ITK low-level image processing module (including speed-ups, API modifications, and concept checking), to improve and refine the ITK watershed segmentation module, improve, to refine and expand the ITK level-set surface modeling solver code including a redesign of the narrow-band solver, and to demonstrate the integration of ITK with visualization and user-interface software through concise publishable examples.  The University of Tennessee has been performing the required services for the past two and a half years under the current contract.  This requirement represents a continuation of the services they are currently providing to the NLM.  By virtue of their expertise and experience gained through their development and implementation under the current contract, the University of Tennessee is uniquely qualified and the only source capable of carrying out these required services in the required time frame and without duplication of cost to the government and undue delays.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to the University of Tennessee without full and open competition is planned.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

Evaluations will be based on the premise that, if all offerors are of approximately equal qualitative merit award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price.  The Government will consider making award to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price differential between it and the other offers warrants doing so.   The Government will evaluate offers in two general steps:   Step 1.  An initial evaluation will be performed to determine if all required information has been provided and the offeror has made a reasonable attempt to present an acceptable offer.  Offerors may be contacted for only clarification purposes during the initial evaluation.  Offers determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their disqualification and the reasons therefore and excluded from further consideration.   Step 2.  All acceptable offers will be evaluated against the specifications and SOW included with the solicitation announcement as well as the three value characteristics.  Based on this evaluation, the Government has the option based on the circumstances of the offers received to utilize one of the following methods: (a)  Make selection and award without discussions: (b) Make selection without determining finalists or conducting discussions and enter into negotiations only with the successful offeror; or (c) After discussions with all finalists, afford each offeror the opportunnity to revise their offer and then make selection. The provisions and clauses in the RFO are those in effect through FAC 01-06. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541614 and $5,000,000 respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for an Engineering cost estimate of a mid L/D aeroshell design for Mars robotic missions. The work will be for a cost estimate for the design, development, certification, and delivery of first flight hardware unit for an aeroshell for a robotic Mars mission that does a direct entry into the Mars atmosphere followed by descent and a soft landing on the Mars surface.  This aeroshell is a slender body configuration consisting of a nose section that is an ellipse of revolution attached to a cylindrical aft section with leeward section that is removed during flight.  The overall aeroshell length is 7.7m with a diameter of 4.6m.  The primary components of the aeroshell are the structure, thermal protection system, parachute system, propulsion system for attitude control, cargo attachment and separation systems, cruise stage attachment and separation systems, and launch vehicle attachments.  Note that the parachute required will be deployed at higher Mach and dynamic pressures than those currently available for Mars. The development, testing and certification of this parachute system will be a major cost component for this slender body aeroshell configuration.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from with Kinetic Stance, LLC  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonable available from only one source.  Competition is impractical because Kinetic Stance has the key personnel, who is currently the Principal Investigator of an MSR study featuring Aeroshell Entry Descent Landing systems.  With extensive knowledge and years of working on this program, the key personnel is critical for this cost estimation work. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 20, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are  acceptable in response to this notice.  Responses shall be posted as amendments to the original synopsis. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Navy has a requirement for five hundred (500) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Housing Frames, P/N (22373) 049-00085-0002. The function of the LCD Housing Frame is to protect the Horizontal / Hover Situation Indicator (HHSI) which is part of the H-46 E-Model Helicopter aircraft instrument panel.  The immediacy of the need is driven by accidental damage to the switches and glass on the LCD currently being sustained during egress of the aircraft by operators and maintainers.  This accidental damage is driven by the limited amount of space available in the highly congested cockpit of the H-46.  The glass in the LCD is no longer available, rendering the $40,000 HHSI as non-Ready-For-Issue, and thus unavailable to the Fleet.  The current wire configuration kick guard does not provide an adequate level of protection for the H-46 HHSI.  The H-46 Integrated Product Team has mitigated all other failure modes associated with the HHSI through the development and implementation of a design change that has resulted in optimum improvements to the HHSI Mean Time Between Failure.  At this time, accidental damage to the knobs and bezel has been the primary cause of HHSI failure.  A bracket installed beneath the HHSI has not proven reliable in preventing damage.  A new LCD Housing Frame, P/N (22373) 049-00085-0002, has been designed to fit around the HHSI bezel.  This design change has been shown to be more reliable in preventing accidental damage to the knobs and bezel.  The proposed source for this procurement is Honeywell International Inc., Olathe, KS 66061.  Honeywell, at its own expense and on its own initiative, has developed a new kick guard that has been tested and proven to be effective in reducing accidental damage to the HHSI. Honeywell is the sole designer and manufacturer of the LCD Housing Frame, P/N (22373) 049-00085-0002.  Honeywell is the only known source with the technical abilities to perform the required modification to meet the H-46 program requirements in a timely manner. The design of the LCD Housing Frame incorporates critical material and dimensional characteristics that must be maintained to ensure correct installation and function.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Newport Corporation in Irvine, CA for the purchase of  (2) two translation stages, (1) one motion controller, (1) one dc actuator, (2) two angle brackets, (1) one multi-axis X-Y stage and 1 (one) multi-axis tilt program.***Sole source determination is based on the need for these stages, controllers, programs and brackets to be completely compatible and interchangeable with existing actuators, controllers and custom designed software to interface computer support and data acquisition supplied by Newport Corporation. These new stages will enable NIST to increase the length of travel along the X-Y axes of the flow coater to allow for exploration of larger samples. The controller will also facilitate the integration of these new stages with auxiliary actuators used in sample preparation, which in turn limits possible conflicts in software programs used to drive the various stages and actuators. The remaining items are to be used in the mounting and assembly of these new stages onto the workstation where the apparatus currently resides.***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 28, 2002. E-mail all questions or comments regarding this notice to joni.laster@nist.gov. ***A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.***

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) awarded contract N01-LM-0-3504 on October 15, 1999, to MathSoft, Inc., 1700 Westlake Avenue, N., Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98109-3044, to assist in the development of an application programmer interface (API) known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK), and first implementation of a Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (SRT).  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate with MathSoft, Inc., on a sole source basis to extend the current contract number N01-LM-0-3504 for twelve months to continue the overall goals of the project, which include streamlining the existing ITK code, improving the consistency of the internal software architecture, extending documentation of the existing algorithms and methods, and generating examples suitable for inclusion in courseware and educational materials associated with ITK.  MathSoft, Inc. is currently providing the required services, and will continue to improve and refine support of ITK multi-resolution registration methods, to improve and refine level-set segmentation algorithms (including consistent implementations of these methods with the existing finite differencing framework), to make consistent the existing frameworks in ITK for finite element models (FEM), and to demonstrate the use of ITK methods such as multi-resolution rigid mutual-information registration through publishable examples.  MathSoft, Inc. has been performing the required services for the past two and a half years under the current contract.  This requirement represents a continuation of the services they are currently providing to the NLM.  By virtue of their expertise and experience gained through their development and implementation under the current contract, MathSoft, Inc. is uniquely qualified and the only source capable of carrying out these required services in the required time frame and without duplication of cost to the government and undue delays.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to MathSoft, Inc. without full and open competition is planned.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. THREE (3) TO THE COMBINED Synopsis/RFO FOR PROVIDE DRAWINGS AND REPLACE THE BOILER AT BLDG. N223 SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their offer. This notice serves as the official amendment to the subject solicitation and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the specifications, post questions and answers, and extend the bid due date. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to May 28, 2002. Specification Change Alert:  Some of the potential Offerers have brought to our attention that NASA has developed a boiler specification that cannot be met.  Having reviewed these claims, it is in the best interest of NASA to amend our parameters.  We have decided to reduce our efficiency level in order to allow for obtainable options and have added a statement on the flue stack.  In so doing, we will also extend our Bid Due Date to allow potential Offerers reasonable opportunity to develop their bid.  Thank you for your understanding. The boiler parameters are revised as follows:         Water or Flex Tube, Forced Draft Boiler with a 2,400,000 Btu/Hr Output (current input is 3,000,000 Btu/Hr), efficiency rating of 85% or better  and the standard NASA gas train.  The flue vent/chimney shall be replaced to the ceiling line at a minimum, but the whole stack shall meet manufacturers or local regulations, whichever is more stringent (however, if a boiler with an efficiency greater than 90% is specified, than the whole chimney will require replacement).  If multiple boilers are specified, the Offerer shall provide a modulation control panel for control of the boilers. BID DUE DATE:  Tuesday,May 28, 2002 1. Looks like the high and low profile combustion air ducts are significantly undersized. Will the contractor be responsible for installing new high/low combustion air ducts? Will roofing and framing also be required?          The Offerer will be responsible for evaluating and installing properly sized new high/low combustion air ducts.  It was stated during the bib walk that the boiler room will need to meet current codes and standard.  This includes the combustion air supplies. 2. The boiler room door has louvers in it allowing air to pass freely from the boiler room to the chiller room. Will this door need to be replaced with a fire rated door? Just leave it as it is or just cover up the louvers on the door?          The louvers can be covered with sheet metal. 3. The sheet rock in the boiler room is damaged. Is the contractor responsible for repairing it to make the room one hour rated? Do all of the existing pipe penetrations through the wall need to be cocked with fire cocking? NASA will replace the existing damaged sheet rock.  The successful Offerer will be responsible for installing/repairing any other items removed or damaged during construction.  The Offerer shall also caulk existing pipe penetrations with an approved fire-rated material. 4. What percentage is required for the performance bond? 100% 5. Is there a warranty required?  All manufacturer warranties on the boiler are applicable, but no separate or extended warranties need to be purchased. 6. Are liquidated damages included? Per FAR 52.211-12 in order to insure that the contractor meets mandatory work deadlines, liquidated damages in the amount of $200 per day will be assessed for every work day needed outside the 90-day stated period in order to complete the job.   7. Does a boiler made in Canada qualify for the Buy American Act? The Buy American Act specifies that supplies for an acquisition of this magnitude must be purchased within the 50 United States of America or an American territory, such as Puerto Rico. NAFTA applies only to construction materials in contracts over $7,068,419 or more, (FAR 25.405(c)). NO CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ADDENDA CLAUSES. Documents related to this solicitationwill be available over the Internet.

<DESC>DESC:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and  Information Services (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking potential sources to provide the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery.   The information received will be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its affiliated U.S. Government (USG) agencies, such as the U.S. Navy,  to assess the availability of sources for commercial Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for the remainder of 2002 and beyond.

All responsible sources are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience.  State whether large, small or disadvantaged business concern.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 514199 applies.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this request.   

NOAA and the U.S. Navy conduct numerous operational programs for which SAR data provides mission critical information.  These data are required for monitoring environmental conditions in oceans, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, and for other areas of interest worldwide, including the monitoring of natural and human-induced hazards.  The requirements for these data are documented in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD) II (dated 9/12/01) for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) available in the Latest News section at http://npoesslib.ipo.noaa.gov.  

NOAA is seeking information on the (1) readiness and performance, (2) licensing and distribution, (3) schedule and cost, (4) volume and area of interest for missions, and (5) statement of capabilities and other comments to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery as described below. 

1.  Please provide a description of your technical capabilities to provide commercial SAR satellite imagery.  At a minimum, address the following:

-	Sensor(s) and satellite(s) 
-	Frequency of coverage (repeatability)
-	High level formats (e.g. CEOS, GeoTIFF, other)
-	Low level data formats (e.g. Level 0 data)
-	Data content (sigma-naught, beta-naught, or other value, calibrated)
-	Data representation (8-bit vs 16-bit)
-	Applications look-up tables (e.g. ice LUT)
-	Data compression (MrSid, other)
-	Ordering processes and required lead times
-	Anticipated file sizes, delivery mechanisms and time lines. 

2.  NOAA is seeking limited data rights to broadcast and distribute SAR satellite imagery for environmental monitoring, education,  non-commercial, and other governmental purposes.  Data and data products or value-added products containing commercial SAR satellite imagery will not be distributed to other commercial entities.  Please describe your current copyright and license agreements.  Address distribution to academic institutions, scientific organizations, or contractors who are acting on behalf of the U.S. government for non-commercial applications.   Discuss the possibility for data sharing with other governments worldwide in areas of common operations, e.g., among foreign national ice centers.

3.  Please provide a schedule and rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) for the costs to the U.S. government to acquire commercial SAR satellite imagery.  Discuss pricing options based on volume, multi-year contracts and redistribution tiers.

As an option, NOAA would like to use its Fairbanks, Alaska Command and Data Acquisition Station to acquire and process SAR satellite imagery.  Discuss licensing and distribution costs for data captured at this facility.  For this option, please also provide information about the orbital parameters of your spacecraft and the uplink and downlink frequencies used for data transmission.

4.  Please describe your capability to provide SAR satellite imagery for the volume and area of interest for the missions below.  Include suggestions for optimizing the operational configuration to receive this imagery in the timeliest manner, from user request to delivery.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to amend synopsis/ solicitation number N00173-02-R-RS03 for a Pedestal Tracking Mount, previously posted in the FBO on 29 April 2002. This amendment is numbered 0001. The purpose of this amendment is to revise the RFP closing date, correct a clerical error in the text, and respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation.  The closing date for Synopsis/ Solicitation Number N00173-02-R-RS03 is hereby extended to 29 MAY 2002.  Reference to Federal Acquisition Circular 01-03 is hereby deleted and replaced with "Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07".  Question 1: How many units are required?  
Answer 1: One (1).  
Question 2: Is it in our favor to propose a shorter delivery time? Answer 2: Delivery time may be proposed for any time prior to the required delivery date specified in the RFP.
Question 3: Does the total weight include the controller?
Answer 3: Total weight does not include the controller.
Question 4: Are there any shock and vibration requirements?
Answer 4: No.
Question 5: Is the system open to the environment?  Can you specify the conditions? (Wind, snow, rain, ice, salt, humidity?)
Answer 5: The Government anticipates that the system will be primarily indoors. Occasionally, the system will be taken to an outdoor range, where it will be protected from adverse weather but may be subject to humidity from 20% to 90% and wind up to 25 mph.
Question 6: What are the physical dimensions of the balanced load?
Answer 6: Typical IR camera ex Radiance camera from Raytheon - 6 inches x 6 inches x 12 inches
Question 7: What are the contract quality requirements?
Answer 7: See Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-4 for Inspection and Acceptance requirements and Warranty requirements.
Question 8: Is it the Government's intent to have the operator manually acquire and track a target up to 500-degrees/sec velocity if the tracking system is not exercised?
Answer 8: 500 deg/sec squared is an acceleration requirement, not a velocity requirement.
Question 9: Are any transportation or shipping cases required?
Answer 9: No.
Question 10: When does NRL anticipate awarding the contract?
Answer 10: Undetermined at this time.  Date of award will be based on the number of proposals received, the time required to perform evaluations, and other factors that cannot be accurately projected at this time.
Question 11: Does NRL have a not-to-exceed budget for this requirement, including options?
Answer 11: Yes, but, as stated in the original RFP, technical considerations and past performance are of greater importance than price for the purpose of proposal evaluation.
Question 12:  Are the specifications based on a currently available product, or are they derived from the user mission statement?
Answer 12: The specifications are derived from requirements.
Question 13: The solicitation states that a small business is 750 employees.  I thought a small business was 500 employees or less.  Has this changed?
Answer 13: The definition of what constitutes a small business varies between the different NAICS codes.  In certain cases, the number of employees is the determining criteria.  In other cases, dollar income is the determining factor.  Please reference the current NAICS codes.
Question 14: There is no NSN listed.  Is this a COTS procurement or is there any development involved?
Answer 14: The Government anticipates this to be a COTS procurement.
Question 15:  Is it an absolute requirement for 3 references to which the same or similar products have been delivered within the last two years?
Answer 15: See Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.305(a)(2)(iv).
Question 16: Is the tracker meant for shipboard use?
Answer 16: See Answer 5, above.
Question 17: Is the tracking accuracy and angular resolution specification a hard requirement?
Answer 17: Yes
Question 18: What is the power requirement?
Answer 18: None
Question 19: Can you provide me with a technical point of contact?
Answer 19:  It is not appropriate to do so at this time.
Question 20: Can you provide physical, electrical, and optical performance data (i.e., focal length- fixed or zoom) for the visible video camera option?  Is it correct to assume that this option includes the automatic video tracker electronics (AVTE)?
Answer 20: 6 deg FOV fixed.  Yes for the AVTE.
Question 21: (a) Is it correct to assume that the track head is the portion of the tracking mount that provides the azimuth and elevation motion for the payload?  (b) What is the width requirements for the tracking head?  Are there height, width, and weight requirements for the pedestal portion of the tracking mount?  (c) Is it correct to assume that the pedestal is just a barbette/post to support the tracking mount?
Answer 21: (a) Yes. (b) No width requirement. No requirement on pedestal.  The Government desires that the whole system be about 42-inches tall (to the center of az/el axes). (c) Yes, pedestal is just a post.
Question 22: Can the total azimuth travel of 180 degrees be interpreted as +/- 90 degrees?  Can the total elevation travel be interpreted as +/- 37.5 degrees?
Answer 22: Yes to both questions.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.

<DESC>Optical Radiation Research and Field Services: Laser and Broadband Bioeffects and Personnel Protection, SSS PKR-02-02. Qualified sources are sought for professional scientific and engineering services in primary support of the Optical Radiation Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory?s Human Effectiveness Directorate; as well as provide support to US Army and US Navy biomedical detachments at Brooks AFB TX. Scientific, engineering, and analytical capabilities are sought to understand, mitigate, and exploit effects of optical radiation devices (lasers and broadband) and their countermeasures on personnel. Technical efforts will focus on six major areas: safety standards for optical sources; personnel susceptibility to optical sources; personnel protection against optical systems; high energy laser (HEL) safety analysis; optical radiation bioeffects; and optical radiation safety. Research will require experiments using human and non-human subjects, studies that correlate optical exposure with visual function and performance, threshold studies for eye and skin injuries, development of diagnostic and triage technologies and medical treatment modalities, development of methods to assess probability of exposure to optical radiation, and field hazard analysis of military and commercial systems. Efforts will require development and testing of protection technologies, low-vision models and simulations, medical accident registry and safety databases, operational engagement models, and special test equipment that measures physical, psychophysical, and environmental properties of optical protection. On-site government facilities equipment at Brooks AFB TX will be used, although performance of some work off-site is permissible and may be required. Potential offerors must be able to demonstrate capability in the areas of psychophysics, optical engineering, systems analysis, ophthalmology, optometry, mathematics, statistics, risk assessment visualization and simulation, laser physics, test and measurement, non-linear optics, or theoretical physics. A thorough knowledge of laser safety and biomedical literature, personnel protection technologies, visual performance in military environments, and radiometry across the optical waveband is essential, as well as capabilities and experience in software engineering that would be at least the equivalent of CMM Level II certification criteria. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) 60 month, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated for this effort. Any contract awarded from this requirement will require the contractor to have a ?Cleared Facility.? Contractor personnel will be required to have a Secret security clearance, with some personnel cleared to the Top Secret level. Teaming is highly encouraged, as well as the use of technical consultants in academia and industry.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXTERNAL EXPRESS PALLET SYSTEM ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS)
<DESC>NASA/Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas 77058, Mail Code: OA  Description:     PURPOSE:  This is a “Request for Information” (RFI) only. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks information related to commercial interest in two categories.  CATEGORY A: Potential Commercial/Non-NASA Users of the ISS External Accommodations  CATEGORY B: Potential Commercial Providers for an External EXPRESS Pallet System for ISS This RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  Upon review of the information provided to NASA, it may be determined that it is in the best interest of the Government and Private Industry to make a “Request for Entrepreneurial Offers” requesting such commercial offers which could lead to a “Commercial Space Act Agreement”.    FRAMEWORK: ·  EXPRESS Pallet Needs:   NASA needs up to three (3) EXPRESS Pallet (ExP) Systems (in accordance with NASA specifications) to be launched and left on-orbit beginning in the late 2003, early 2004 timeframe. The ExP system consists of 24 Adapter equivalents, 5 Controller units, a NBL Trainer, 5 STEP-EPs, an EP Trainer, 1 EP Checkout unit/KSC, Integration Services, Sustaining Engineering on H/W and S/W, Maintenance, and Operational and Training Support.  ·  Flight Rate:    As part of the FY03 Program Operating Plan (POP) review process, NASA is currently accessing 3 different flight rate options.  The three options being accessed are for a Shuttle flight rate of 4, 5, or 6 flights per year, which will support the launch of up to 12 Express Pallet adapters per year, to be shared between commercial and non-commercial users.   Information obtained from this request could provide NASA the necessary information it needs to determine the number of adapters per year for those higher flight rate options based on the expected commercial use.  ·  Terms: Currently, no public funds have been or are anticipated to be appropriated to NASA for allocation to these public-private partnerships. The terms and conditions of any agreement or partnership are flexible in cases where there is significant private investment and a clear public benefit.  Such flexibility includes but is not limited to negotiating part or all, of the marginal costs for NASA provided resources and capabilities in the near term where there is strong potential that a particular commercial ISS activity will become self-sustaining or such an activity enhances the International Space Station. ·  General Information : Commercial use of the ISS, Commercial Accommodations, Offer Contents, and Pricing are located at website:   http://commercial.hq.nasa.gov   .     INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED: CATEGORY A: Potential Commercial/Non-NASA Users of the ISS External Accommodations 1.  What organization, company or other Government agency do you represent? 2.  What would you use the ISS for and what would be the purpose/end product of such use? 3.  What % of your end use will benefit US taxpayers? 4.  How many flight opportunities would you need and over what period of time? 5.  What Payload Accommodation/Services would you need both during launch, on-orbit and for return (i.e. Truss site, single or multiple adapter sites, viewing angle, etc.) 6.  Describe general user requirements? 7.  What price are you willing to pay for both transportation and accommodation access to the International Space Station External Users Accommodations  CATEGORY B: Potential Commercial Providers for an External EXPRESS Pallet System for ISS 1.  Description of Offer: ·   Describe business venture – technical & commercial merits ·   Top level project milestone schedule ·   Services required from the US Government/NASA ·   Benefits to the Government/NASA/public ·   Terms and conditions of Agreement 2.  Technical information: ·   Description of hardware/software/services ·   Description of operational concept 3.  Company information & Management Team ·   Ownership ·   Location and Facilities Required ·   Services provided ·   Points of contact (business & technical) ·   Top Level Organizational Structure 4.  Market Analysis & Strategy Summary ·   Industry Analysis – competition, risks, etc. ·   Target market and projected market capture  ·   Extent to which your business case is dependent on U.S. government users ·   Sales Forecast and basis of estimates (Pricing) ·   Assumptions that involve a commitment by NASA (i.e. Shuttle Flight Rate, Use Rate (Adapter/year), % for Commercial, % for NASA, Price Structure, Integration Time, Documentation Structure, Customer Base, etc.) ·   Launch Carrier  5  Financial Plan ·   Capital investment plan ·   Contingency plan ·   Break Even Analysis ·   Profit and Loss Responses Due: Responses to this RFI are due no later than June 14, 2002.

Subject: Request for Industry Comments. RFP USZA22-02-R-0005, USSOCOM Language Training Support. 

Dear Industry Partners,
 
The United States Special Operations Command is planning to purchase comprehensive language training support under an umbrella contract in support of all of SOF for these services. This includes the major components (Army, Air Force, Navy). This objective is to acquire these training services in accordance with the attached draft Statement of Work/Performance Work Statements (PWS). The PWS is not 100% complete at this time but that is because some valuable data is missing.  That data is your input.  We would like you, if you were interested to take time and submit your recommendations in making this a quality product. For instance, your comments on the type of contract vehicle and your comments on the structure of Schedule B are important to us. The Government normally dictates these areas. 

Our goal to you is to have a final solicitation posted in early June.   As you can see we are under a very tight schedule with the overall award(s) NLT 30 Sep 2002.  To do that we ask for your support in providing your input to us no later than 17 May 2002 for Government consideration.  Let me assure you that we will listen and consider your input seriously but we will make final decisions based on overall impact to our mission requirements. Please add your touch to this process.

The objectives we are trying to achieve for this contract are stated in the PWS, particularly Section 1.0 Scope. The main objective is to place the language training needs for all of the component commands within USSOCOM under one or perhaps up to two ?umbrella? contracts. The contract (s) will provide specific visibility into areas where duplication may be occurring and offer opportunities for cost savings. Proper management of the language training service contract will give a ?big picture? of total asset visibility and allow the Commander in Chief (CINC) and subordinates to make better and more informed decisions. Some of the areas that I, as the Contracting Officer would like particular feedback on is as follows:

(a) Part of our initial determination is whether the government will reserve this action for small business as a set-aside. The overall management structure for contract performance seems considerable.  

 	(b) The contract resulting from this solicitation will be considered a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with some minor variations as designated in Section B. The contract will be awarded for base period of five (5) ordering periods, with the potential for four incentive award term extensions.  Section B at this time only contains the base year.  We want your input before we finalize the out years for this solicitation.   

(c) For planning purposes, an industry briefing and individual one-on-one sessions (with prime companies only for one-on-one) the date and destination for this has not been establish but will be held in the near future. The briefing will require attendees to be cleared to a minimum SECRET clearance.  If this posses as a problem please notify us as soon as possible.  

(d) The Government plans to require the contractor to be accredited, as stated in Section 1.3 of the PWS. Your opinion on this matter is solicited.   

	For purposes of this contract, the term "user" is defined as any person, including but not limited to members of the uniformed services, civilian Government employees, and contractor personnel requiring services under this contract.
 



We look forward to hearing from you and hope this draft documents gives you the information you will need to make a business decision.  IF you should have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me directly at (813) 828-7347 or Mr. David Johnson, (813) 828-7448 or Ms Kathleen Henderson (813) 828-4820. We are here to support our customers in getting the best support but to assist you in getting the answers!
