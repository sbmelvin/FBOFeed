<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE AIR FORCE TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS NOTICE.</p>
<p><br />The intent of this notice is to update the SSM-R industry partners regarding the SSM-R DRAFT RFP Release.</p>
<p>1. The Government requests all Offerors intending to Prime on the SSM-R contract to respond with any comments and questions on the attached Comment Resolution Matrix to the following address: 850ELSG.PK.Workflow.PAFB@us.af.mil. Please provide all comments no later than 2 p.m. Mountain time on May 4, 2018.</p>
<p>2. The Government has questions to industry pre-populated in the Comment Resolution Matrix.</p>
<p>3. The CDRLs that the Government intends to include in the SSM-R contract are iterated, at a minimum, one time in the Draft RFP. Offerors may see an additional instance or version of a given CDRL if the same CDRL is attached to multiple work statements and the requirements related to, or included in, that CDRL are different to the extent that the Government perceived it was advantageous to provide an additional version. At formal RFP release, the Government intends to have all CDRLs populated for all orders.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to provide to industry a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Summary document as clarifications to any questions or comments. The Government does not intend to reply directly to any comments or questions.</p>
<p>5. The Government is willing to hold/conduct limited, 1 hour, telephonic one-on-one communications with Offerors intending to Prime on the SSM-R contract to address specific issues and questions that Offerors may have regarding the SSM-R draft RFP documents. To schedule a telephonic one-on-one communication with the SSM-R team regarding the SSM-R DRAFT RFP, submit an e-mail to 850ELSG.PK.Workflow.PAFB@us.af.mil and provide several proposed dates from which the SSM-R team may select.

Once the one-on-one is scheduled and confirmed by the Government, the requesting industry partner will be required to submit, in writing, the specific questions it intends to discuss during the one-on-one not later than 24 hours prior to the scheduled one-on-one. The purpose of providing this information is so the Government can dedicate adequate and appropriate resources to address the issues and or questions. Failure to submit questions to the Government as prescribed, will result in the scheduled one-on-one being rescheduled or cancelled.</p>
<p>6. The Government currently anticipates releasing the SSM-R RFP in August 2018, but is striving for an earlier release.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon all potential offerors to ensure that once a FINAL RFP is released in the future, the FINAL RFP is thoroughly reviewed to identify changes/updates that may, and most likely will, occur from this DRAFT RFP to the FINAL RFP.</p>

<SUBJECT>Respirator Study: Assessment of Elastomeric Respirators in Healthcare Delivery Settings
<SOLNBR>2018-N-67799
<RESPDATE>041918
<CONTACT>Katie L. Oyler, Contract Specialist, Phone 4123864450, Email ycy4@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Office of Acquisition Services (OAS) on behalf of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Personal Protective Technologies Laboratory (NPPTL) intends to issue a solicitation for an initiative is to determine the feasibility and capability of U.S. healthcare delivery organizations to routinely use reusable respirators and/or rapidly convert to their use during a public health emergency.<br /><br />It is intended that multiple contracts will be awarded as a result of the upcoming solicitation. <br /><br />Background Information:<br />The demand for the respiratory protective devices (RPD) worn by U.S. healthcare personnel (HCP) during a large respiratory infectious disease outbreak, such as an influenza pandemic, is expected to far exceed domestic supplies. Approximately 3.6 billion disposable and 1.6 million reusable respirators may be needed. A rapid increase in RPD usage was apparent during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). During these events, HCP reported that N95 filtering facepiece respirators were not readily available in some locations due to exhaustion of available supplies, inability of suppliers and manufacturers to meet the surge in demand, and shortages of fit testing equipment.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthcare facilities stockpile a six to eight-week supply of disposable N95s, however achieving this recommendation has been a challenge for many due to financial limitations. In 2012, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials estimated that U.S. acute care hospitals have 60 million N95 respirators on hand, two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated demand during a severe influenza pandemic. This underscores the importance of including RPD in the Strategic National Stockpile maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br /><br />Wider utilization of reusable elastomeric respirators, which can be cleaned and repeatedly worn, are being considered as one way to mitigate shortages of disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies. The Veterans Health Administration recently stockpiled elastomeric respirators for use during a surge in demand for N95 respirators. The National Academy of Medicine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration have recently held stakeholder meetings to assess, in part, the potential future role of elastomeric respirators in healthcare delivery. In 2013, Worksafe British Columbia issued a report about the use of elastomeric respirators during a surge in demand. In 2009, the University of Maryland Medical System began fitting HCP with elastomeric respirators to wear during patient care. Another study by the Veterans Health Administration determined that stockpiling elastomeric respirators, in addition to other types of respiratory protection, may result in considerable cost savings.<br /><br />However, reusable elastomeric respirators are infrequently used in U.S. healthcare delivery, so most HCP have little or no experience with them. CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) need to better understand whether and in what settings elastomeric respirators could be used in the context of patient care, especially during public health emergencies when there is an increase in demand for N95s and other RPD.<br /><br />The purpose of this initiative is to determine the feasibility and capability of U.S. healthcare delivery organizations to routinely use reusable respirators and/or rapidly convert to their use during a public health emergency. A competitive contract funding mechanism will identify and select up to three U.S. healthcare delivery organizations as partners for a series of demonstration projects and clinical studies.<br /><br />The Statement of Work includes a Base Contract and two Options (two optional tasks). Offerors may submit a proposal for (1) the Base Contract, (2) the Base Contract and Option A, (3) the Base Contract and Option B, or (4) the Base Contract, Option A, and Option B.<br /><br />The government intends to post the solicitation around the end of April.

Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, April 17, 2018 at 10 AM local time at Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge, 4009 Hill Road, Tule Lake, CA 96134-9715. If attending the site visit please contact Stacy Freitas at stacy_freitas@fws.gov or (530) 667-8308.  Contractors should submit any questions on this project directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov later than close of business on Thursday, April 19, 2018. Questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment directly thereafter.

The following is the current Statement of Work of the required tasks. 


1. General

The purpose of this contract is to remove lead shot from the soil of an abandoned small arms range at Tule Lake NWR per the attached Work Plan.  The Work Plan was prepared by Ahtna Environmental Inc. (Ahtna) to guide field staff in the future cleanup of lead associated with the former small arms firing range at the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The location and layout of the Tule Lake NWR firing range is shown on Figures 1 and 2.  The purpose of the attached Work Plan is to document site specific ecological risk-based threshold concentration (RBTC) for lead, proposed remedial action areas, the methods that will be utilized for the removal, dust management protocols, disposal requirements, and backfill and grading requirements.

Camp Tule Lake is a culturally significant property on the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge that served as a civilian conservation center and segregation facility.  The camp was established by the U.S. government in 1935 to accommodate vocational trainees as part of the expansion of available land for the Klamath Reclamation Project.  During World War II the camp was used for sheltering Japanese American strikebreakers, imprisoning Japanese American dissidents, and housing Italian and German prisoners of war.  After the war, on 25 April 1946, the camp was transferred from the Army back to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).  In 2008, Camp Tule Lake was included as part of the larger Tule Lake Unit when it was designated as the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument.  Camp Tule Lake is currently co-managed by the Service and the National Park Service (NPS).  The purpose of the Tule Lake Unit is to preserve, study, and interpret the history and setting of the incarceration and later segregation of Japanese Americans at Tule Lake during World War II.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a one year fixed price purchase order to Inova Diagnostic, Inc., San Diego, CA 92131 for the acquisition of reagents kits and supplies used in patient and donor testing.
<p><br />The proposed vendor, Inova Diagnostic, Inc., is the only known manufacturer, registered trademark holder and supplier for all of the reagents kits and supplies that must be used with the Dynex DSX&reg; System currently in place to process various ELISA assays for the Department of Laboratory Medicine/Chemistry Department on the NIH campus. The reagent kits and supplies have been validated for patient care testing and FDA approved for Dynex DSX&reg; System. Any non-FDA approved supplies or systems could cause the cancellation of patient care testing or delays in completion of various protocols. This would cause unwarranted expenditure or possible waste of very limited Government research funds and time. The comprehensive system of the instrument, reagents, and consumables is necessary to produce a complete testing result.</p>
<p>The estimated product list and quantity is attached to this notice and titled-Supply List 18-005366. The exact quantity of products cannot be estimated at the time of award. The government reserves the right to increase quantities pursuant to FAR 52.217-6. The purchase order shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(i) allowing the Contracting Officer (CO) to solicit from one source. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Each response should include the following Business Information:</p>
<p>a. DUNS.<br />b. Company Name, address, POC, Phone and Email address<br />c. Current GSA Schedules or NAICS codes appropriate to this Award.<br />d. Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, hubZone, veteran owned, etc.) as validated in System For Award Management (SAM). All offerors must register on the SAM located at http://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/#1<br />e. Capability Statement</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT seeks to lease the following office space through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP):<br />State: North Dakota<br />City: Bismarck<br />Delineated Area: Rapid City Downtown Area Plan East of East BLVD. <br />Minimum ABOA Sq. Ft.: 6800<br />Maximum ABOA Sq. Ft.: 7000<br />Parking: 12 spaces<br />Space Type:	Office<br />Term:	Up to 15 Years<br />Agency Specific Requirements:
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG08. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with RLP 17-REG08 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease. All documents can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

In making its determination about whether alternative space is economically advantageous, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through replacing the existing lease and relocating to the alternative space, such as the potential cost of remaining liability on the existing lease, physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.<span style="line-height: 23.4667px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Government will not consider expressions of interest it receives after the deadline established for the receipt of expressions of interest.<span style="line-height: 23.4667px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Government</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;seeks to lease the following space:</span>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The UHUD is an element of the A/OA-10 navigational system and is considered a subset of the A-10A Inertial Navigation System's (INS), which interfaces to the Integrated Fire and Flight Control Computer (IFFCC) and UHUD Control Panel. The UHUD is a data display subsystem which receives power and signal inputs from aircraft subsystems. The UHUD provides the pilot with a visual display of weapon delivery and target information in both day and night operations. In addition, the UHUD also provides real-time simplified visual aids for normal flight operations. The UHUD displays flight information to the pilot by projecting an image from the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) onto the Combiner Assembly which is positioned in front of the pilot. This allows the pilot to maintain a forward-looking field of view through the Combiner Assembly. The projected image is focused at optical infinity so that the pilot does not have to refocus when viewing the image or the aircraft's surrounding environment. In the event of an electronics failure, the UHUD PU includes an electrically generated depressible standby aiming reticle to serve as a backup or emergency mode of operation. The Technical Orders (TOs) identified in the "Subject" will be utilized while performing Depot repair and maintenance. These procedures are required to guide Air Force technical through the successful repair of an unserviceable asset while utilizing the UHUD Test Systems Part Numbers: 201326926-10. <br /><br />See attached Sources Sought Synopsis with Contractor Capability Survey and Statement of Work for additional information.</span></p>

<DESC>The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch Systems Enterprise Directorate (LE), Experimental Launch and Test Division (LEX), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM is interested in obtaining capability statements demonstrating industry's ability to meet Excess Ballistic Missile (XBM) motor sustainment and independent verification, and validation (IV&amp;V) mission assurance requirements for launch vehicles based on XBM and commercial propulsion systems. RSLP provides XBM motor storage, maintenance, and logistics support, and utilizes XBM motors and commercial launch vehicles to provide launch services, payload integration, and mission planning for Government customers. <br /><br />The RSLP Mission Assurance (MA) contract will procure MA support for Peacekeeper (PK)/Minuteman (MM) based launch vehicles, and commercial liquid engines and solid motor based rocket systems using Government certified and Federal Aviation Administration licensed launches. The objective of the MA process is to identify and mitigate design, production, and test deficiencies that could impact mission success for orbital and suborbital launch services. <br /><br />MA is defined as an integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis, production, verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution process performed over the lifecycle of a launch system, from mission conception to space vehicle separation in the required orbit, including collision avoidance and de-orbit maneuver(s), as required. MA services include, but are not limited to, technical, engineering, and analytical services, quick response research, mission assurance, and special studies to support launch vehicle acquisition, launch mission planning, the launch campaign process, and post-flight reporting for suborbital and orbital RSLP missions.<br /><br />The current Launch Services Mission Assurance contract with incumbent, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) Federal Space and Defense (AS&amp;D), expires on 13 December, 2019.

<p>A. Objective:</p>
<p>To find sources that are qualified to meet the supplies/services as listed in section 11B. Note that the specific requirements in section C are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.</p>
<p>B. ISO 9001 certification requires an external, independent audit of the management system to verify the program is meeting the ISO requirements. This certification provides unbiased confirmation the management system is working, meeting the customer service benchmarks, and continuous improvement objectives. Therefore, the independent audit verifies the program is meeting customers' requirements for high-quality, validated, and standardized biological detection assays and reagents that are available and accurate at point of use.</p>
<p>To achieve ISO 9001 registration, the DBPAO will undergo two audit stages. The stage 1 audit primarily consists of quality management system document review.
