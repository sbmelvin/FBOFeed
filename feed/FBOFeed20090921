The current Power 911 Positron work center employed by Seymour Johnson AFB is a proprietary product of  AT&T and has proprietary rights to all parts and specifications necessary for the required upgrade.  Manufacturer:  Bellsouth.  

This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:Rachael.Roney@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Samuel S. Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Hereafter "VA"), located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, plans to solicit the market and make competitive award of a Real Property Lease Agreement for approximately 9,000 net usable and 10,000 gross square feet of program office space located within five miles of the VA.  The space must include at least 40 parking spaces.  At least two patient spaces must be marked as handicapped and located directly adjacent to the building entrance.The five-mile geographic radius will be measured directly, independent of landscape (i.e., "as the crow flies").  The radius will be strictly enforced and the VA will not accept or consider offers from beyond its boundaries.  Evaluation will likely take into account the proximity of the space to the medical center. The anticipated lease agreement would be for a five-year base term with one five-year option to be exercised by the unilateral action of the VA. The VA will consider the following type of response to fulfill this need.  The lease shall be for a standard fit-out ready stand-alone building or suite with active utility connections that can be modified to meet the general needs and floor plan of the Veteran Community Outreach Center (VCOC).  This structure may be existing, or constructed as a build-to-suit project.  The VA would be the sole occupant of this space once fit-out appropriately for its use.  The VA would anticipate amortizing the cost of any fit-out/construction into the monthly rental payments to be made to the lessor across the five-year base term of the lease.A beneficial occupancy date, with the space fully modified and prepared for the VA's use, is required no later than April 1, 2010.  Evaluation will likely take into account whether the offered space could be made ready for VA use prior to that date.  Interested parties are required to send an email to rachael.roney@va.gov and/or sonja.stroud@va.gov to request a market survey of their available property.  This email must be received no later than October 9, 2009.  The email must include a point of contact name, telephone number, email address, the physical address of the property, the available square footage, asking price (if available), and a general overview of the building's age, condition, prior/current use, and available utilities.Following October 9, the VA will begin the process of formal market surveys at each offered site.  This market survey will consist of a group of VA stakeholders visiting and evaluating each offered space to make a go/no-go determination of whether the space currently meets or can be made to meet the VA's needs.  These market surveys are anticipated to occur during standard business hours in the month of October, and will require the building owner or a designee pre-approved by the VA to be present.  Market surveys are typically 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length.Following market surveys, the VA will release a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) to owners of spaces which were rated as a "go" during the market survey.  This SFO will specify a time period in which offerors must prepare a full, signed lease offer and submit the offer to the VA for final evaluation.  The VA may conduct discussions (negotiations) as necessary with offerors to reach a final, best-value decision regarding the ultimate award of a lease.  All correspondence regarding this synopsis, the resulting solicitation, and the ultimate award of this lease must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.  The approved designees for this procurement are Rachael Roney and Sonja Stroud, who are available at 518-626-6137 or 518-626-6139, respectively. The contract specialists can be reached via e-mail at rachael.roney@va.gov or sonja.stroud@va.gov.

<DESC>East Canyon Dam CRB
This sole source determination has been prepared to document the facts and rationale to support the determination that according to FAR 6.302-5 Authorized or Required by Statute.  
The expert services are sought based on unique technical qualifications to review Reclamation's state-of-the-art analysis to understand the dynamic performance of the East Canyon thin-arch dam and potentially unstable foundation blocks upon which it is placed.  As a state-of-the-art analysis, very few experts in the world are capable of efficient and technically adequate review of the volumous and complex dynamic predictions and failure probabilities of the interaction of the thin-arch dam with the foundation, potentially unstable foundation blocks and hydrodynamic reservoir models subjected to extreme ground motions.
The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act and the Reclamation Public Protection Guidelines states that, for estimated annualized loss-of-life risk greater than 0.01 lives per year, Reclamation considers there to be justification for taking expedited action to reduce risk.  The Guidelines further state that every effort should be made to complete the risk reduction actions within 90 days of determining the need for expedited action.  
The July 30, 2009 risk analysis identified risks greater than 0.01 lives lost per year and the associated analysis and the recommendations to reduce the risk are ready for review by the CRB. As required by the Guidelines, risk reduction recommendations cannot be initiated until the CRB review is complete, so the procurement of the CRB services is urgent to comply with the Guidelines.
Specific citations of these Guidelines and Public Laws are:
Reclamation Safety of Dams ActPublic Law 95-578, November 2, 1978, as amended by Public Law 98-404 (August 28, 1984),Public Law 106-377 (October 27, 2000),Public Law 107-117 (January 10, 2002),Public Law 108-439 (December 3, 2004)Reclamation Guidelines For Achieving Public Protection in Dam Safety Decisionmaking (June 15, 2003)
Actions to reduce risk could include economically, socially and politically unacceptable and extreme alternatives such as evacuation of downstream inhabitants and/or restricting the reservoir to lower water surface elevations.  The preferred alternative that will be recommended to the CRB will be drilling to reduce foundation pressures and to support additional testing to reduce uncertainties in the analysis.  Another issue supporting the urgency of this procurement is the need to complete this drilling before the start of Winter 2009, when the drilling operations will become very difficult and expensive.

Synopsis: - Presoliciation Notice

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-investment Act of 2009 Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice of request for quotation TIRNO-09-Q-00163 to purchase monthly maintenance for the Intelligent Call Manager (ICM) / Customer Voice Portal (CVP) systems against Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) number TIRNO-04-Z-00007 with AT&T, a large business,  which provides for the upgrade of the Intelligent Contact Manager (ICM) and Customer Voice Portal (CVP) architectures.       

This requirement is to purchase maintenance of the telephone call routing systems at the IRS Call Centers. The Intelligent Contact Manager (ICM) is a sub-segment of the Contact-Call Centers that provides skill-status based call routing between multiple IRS’ Call Centers. It monitors real-time status and availability of Automated Call Distributors (ACD), Voice Response Units (VRU) and Agents (Customer Service / Collection Representatives) at more than 25 Call Centers. Such real-time call management is performed based on a dedicated ICM server-network infrastructure, which is comprised of central ICM servers (at two locations: prime Martinsburg Computing Center (MCC) and backup Tennessee Computing Center (TCC)) and peripheral ICM servers at the call centers). 
The Customer Voice Portal (CVP) is a web-based platform that provides for Prompt/Collect, Queuing, and Call Control services for contact centers and self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications. 
The IRS call center and Intelligent Contact Manager (ICM)/Customer Voice Portal (CVP) environment is not static, and numerous changes may be made throughout each year. The Contractor must be capable of responding quickly to task order requirements and providing responsive, timely services to ensure program success.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO AT & T Corporation.
 
A task order will be placed against a competitively awarded General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under the authority of FAR Subpart 8.4.  The IRS requires maintenance support for the intelligent Contact Manager (ICM) and the Customer Voice Portal (CVP).  The critical nature of this work requires individuals that have the specialize knowledge of the IRS Contact Center Environment (CCE).

<DESC>RECOVERY – PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) and Manual Turning Machines or Lathes. The CNC and Manual Lathes use various types of cutting tools to precisely turn / machine through materials to create complex geometric shapes to the desired configuration and tolerance. The CNC and Manual Lathes will be used for manufacturing and fabrication support services provided by the Fabrication Technology Division (FTD) of NIST. 
A lathe is a machine tool which spins material to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, or deformation with tools that are applied to the work piece to create an object which has symmetry about an axis of rotation.
Lathes are used in metalworking, metal spinning, and glass working. Most suitably equipped metalworking lathes are used to produce most solids of revolution, plane surfaces and screw threads or helices. The material is held in place by either one or two centers, at least one of which can be moved horizontally to accommodate varying material lengths. Lathes may be manually operated, mechanically automated, or digitally automated via CNC.

The Fabrication Technology Division (FTD) provides a wide range of engineering, fabrication and technical services to support the creation of unique measurement instruments and scientific apparatus needed by researchers in the NIST's Measurement and Standards Laboratories. FTD provides the mission critical engineering and manufacturing expertise and equipment needed to produce specialized parts and subassemblies for the extraordinary variety of one-of-a-kind instruments conceived by NIST scientists and engineers. 

FTD’s primary line of service is metal fabrication, mechanical engineering, and electromechanical assembly.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, Port Hueneme Site, CA is currently soliciting offers for engineering services which will directly support Commander, Naval Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  The government intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for engineering and analytical support services for the operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft as required by the  COMOPTEVFOR. This requirement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition. The solicitation and resulting contract will be for one base year and four additional one-year option periods. The main testing squadron supported by this acquisition will be Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9). The scope of this acquisition includes engineering and technical support for all phases of OT&E. OT&E may be divided up into early involvement, OT&E planning, OT&E execution, OT&E reporting, and in-service monitoring phases. The OT&E phases may be generally described as follows: Early Involvement: This is the earliest OT&E phase of a program, and typically begins more than one year prior to the first scheduled OT&E event. Tasks and deliverables during this phase focus on planning and resourcing future OT&E, and coordination with DT&E (Developmental Test and Evaluation).  OT&E Planning: This includes preparation for an OT&E phase of a program that will typically occur within one year. Tasks and deliverables during this phase center on detailed test planning and scheduling. DT&E coordination continues. OT&E Execution: This includes executing the actual OT&E. Tasks during this phase focus on scheduling, coordination, briefing, participation in, and debriefing test events. Deliverables focus on data collection and anomaly reporting. OT&E Reporting. This phase of OT&E centers on drafting the OT&E report after completion of the testing. This phase is time limited. Tasks include data collection and analysis. The draft final report deliverable is the contractor's prime focus during this phase. In-Service Monitoring. This optional phase occurs after OT&E is completed, reported, and the tested system is fielded. COMOPTEVFOR and VX-9 may determine a need exists to situate an analyst on-site with a fleet unit employing a system VX-9 recently completed testing on. Tasks focus on monitoring the performance of the fielded system. Deliverables include anomaly reports and drafts standard USN/USMC deficiency reports. Estimated performance start date is March 1, 2010.  Potential Offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This office will not issue hard-copy solicitations. The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 541330. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required from all large business offerors. Award will be made on a best-value basis; price and other factors are being considered.  An industry day is planned for the week of 5 October 2009 at Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake, CA.  The exact date and time will be posted via an amendment to this notice.  The anticipated release date for draft RFP number N00244-09-R-0072 is October 5, 2009.  The final RFP is planned for release one week after the Industry Day.  The RFP will close approximately 30 days after issuance. The closing date and time will be specified on the cover page of the RFP document.   The government will attempt to post draft documents to the NECO website as they become available. Interested parties are therefore encouraged to check the NECO website frequently for updates. Industry questions and comments while the documents are in draft phase are highly encouraged and should be sent to the POC via email as early as soon as possible after the draft documents have been posted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive award to Jacobs Associates (JA) in San Francisco, CA to extend a number of boreholes in the Anacostia watershed located in Washington, DC. This service is required to fulfill the need of the U.S. Geological Survey MD-DE-DC Water Science Center.  Services to be delivered by November 30, 2009.
JA is the only known source for this requirement because; JA is already under a contract by DC WASA for the drilling of the boreholes.  There will be a significant cost savings to the USGS be appending the boreholes, rather than contracting to have entire new boreholes drilled to bedrock or incurring expenses for a new casing to prevent the hole from collapsing and working with a new vendor to continue the work while risking damage to the hole.
THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). 
All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
FAX response to 703.648.7367 or email to:  tcrawford@usgs.gov.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:<BR><BR><BR><BR>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W9113M-09-R-0008, for the Development of Medical Countermeasures (therapeutics) for the Treatment of Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (HFV) will be issued on or about 16 October 2009 with an anticipated contract award on or about 30 April 2010.  This requirement is a total set aside for small businesses.  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website: http://www.ccr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost plus incentive type to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.  If you are a small business prime you would be required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Under the 50% rule in the case of a contract for supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the concern shall perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.<BR><BR>The Transformational Medical Technical Initiative (TMTI) mission is to protect the Warfighter from bioengineered or newly emergent biological threats by providing a response capability from identification of pathogens through the delivery of medical countermeasures.  To support this effort, TMTI anticipates multiple awards for development of therapeutics for the treatment of Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (HFV).  Only those therapeutics that have reached the HFV Class entry criteria are eligible to be considered for these contracts.  The HFV Class threshold entry criterion is: <BR><BR>Compound has demonstrated and achieved Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (as defined by the Integrated Medical TRLs https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=f6246b5fa678b0b327ab299902ed2015&tab=core&_cview=0) <BR><BR>Achievement of a TRL is predicated on successful completion of all activities listed for that TRL, as well as all previous TRLs.  For instance, achieving TRL 4 status indicates that a therapeutic has successfully demonstrated all activities as defined by the Integrated Medical TRL for TRL 1, 2, 3 and 4.  <BR><BR>The focus of these contracts is the advanced development and delivery of therapeutics that ideally are broad spectrum and flexible.  The base contract effort requires therapeutics meeting or exceeding the HFV Class threshold entry criterion.  Ultimately, the proposed therapeutic shall, assuming exercise of all options, undergo the New Drug Application/Biologic License Application (NDA/BLA) process and be delivered as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and licensed therapeutic.  TMTI intends to award up to six (6) HFV therapeutic  development contracts.  The base award for each of these contracts is intended to be cost plus incentive fee.  <BR><BR>The base contract will include all activities required to proceed with development of a HFV therapeutic to complete Phase I Clinical Trials exclusive of those activities required to achieve TRL 4.  The specific activities to be conducted will depend on the FDA licensure status of the proposed HFV therapeutic.  Offerors proposing a HFV therapeutic meeting the HFV Class threshold entry criterion but that have not been granted FDA permission to continue into Phase I Clinical Trials will conduct activities to support the submission of their IND, any subsequent tests required by the FDA, and Phase I Clinical Trials.  Offerors proposing a HFV therapeutic meeting HFV Class threshold entry criterion that have been granted permission to continue into Phase I Clinical Trials will conduct activities associated with Phase I Clinical Trials.  The exercise of options will depend on successful completion of the current activities and a favorable evaluation at down-select points, pursuant to a limited competition and stated evaluation criteria, and subject to the Governments paramount right to unilaterally decide not to exercise all options and to discontinue the advanced development of all HFV therapeutics.  TMTI intends to pursue schedule incentives for the base CPIF and each of the options exercised.<BR><BR>A TMTI regulatory compliance team may conduct a facility compliance review to verify the accuracy of the offerors affirmations.  The regulatory compliance team will provide advance notice of its visit to the offerors facilities.  The team shall provide its findings and recommendations to the HFV Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) technical team.  The offeror is solely responsible for furnishing the regulatory compliance team the necessary information to demonstrate meeting the qualifications.<BR><BR>Subcontractors may be used.  If an offerors approach includes subcontract performance, the offeror shall provide the same qualification information for the subcontractor(s).  The government regulatory compliance team may similarly conduct a site visit of the subcontractor(s).  <BR><BR>This acquisition is open to participation by foreign firms at both the prime contract and subcontract level, subject to FAR/DFARS Part 25 limitations.  <BR><BR>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the Best Value to the Government.  Delivery schedules reflecting each phase of the end items development, to include the ultimate delivery of an FDA licensed product, will be proposed by the offerors and will be evaluated under the evaluation criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation.   TMTI anticipates delivery of an FDA licensed therapeutic product within 4 to 6 years from an offerors receipt of an FDA IND acceptance, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 16 October 2009, at the following website: http://www.tmti-cbdefense.org/ .  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.  Questions or correspondence should be directed by e-mail only to sandra.oconnell@us.army.mil and please reference the RFP number W9113M-09-R-0008.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Only questions received within 14 days of issuance of the RFP will be entertained by the Government.<BR>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for to assess the options for installing an air cargo facility for durable and non-durable goods at Tocumen International Airport in Panama.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2008-09 Food Security Assessment, the number of food-insecure people in the Latin American and Caribbean region grew to 31% in 2008. Panama is a centrally located, tropical country with a shortage of refrigerated cargo storage space. The proposed air cargo facility would function as a regional air hub to consolidate and augment the trade of both perishable and non-perishable goods between the United States and Panama. The Grantee, Gulf Coast International Cargo Panama, S.A. (Gulf Coast Panama), is a Panamanian-owned cargo and distribution firm. Gulf Coast Panama has a twenty-year concession for the installation of an air cargo facility for durable and non-durable goods and adjacent office space at the Tocumen International Airport.</p>
<p>The study will consist of a market analysis, design of the facility, and financial analysis. Gulf Coast Panama estimates that the total area of the facility once all phases are completed is around 2,330 square meters. For the first phase of the project, at least 450 square meters of refrigerated storage area will be designated for perishable goods, 500 square meters will be for storage of dry goods, and 150 meters will be designated for office space. Total implementation cost of the facility is estimated $7 million.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $258,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

The Office of Communications and Outreach intends to contract for services from Press Association (450 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001-2603), the nation's oldest, largest, and most widely cited news wire service, for a period of twelve months, from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010. This service meets our needs to access up-to-date and breaking news on national, state, and local levels by providing exclusive on-line access to their AP Internet, Washington Report, and Education Alert and Daybook services for approximately 100 users.

This service also provides a first hand coverage that supports strategic planning and keeps staff on top of developing stories; offers private, internal access to the full stream of AP's premium state coverage; delivers intelligence that can track information on the U.S. Department of Education; and allows users to stay updated on education issues. In addition the Daybook service can provide a schedule of metro and statewide special events, including news conferences, speeches, announcements, meetings, hearings, and other major news events.
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the government will consider all proposals received within the open period of this synopsis. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<CONTACT>Dustin Pitsch, Contract Specialist, Email TMTI_TargetID@dtra.mil - Alynne Faughnan, Contracting Officer, Email TMTI_TargetID@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking technologies to aid in the identification of host pathways and drug-able targets to block infectious diseases caused by emerging and genetically engineered pathogens within DTRA’s Transformational Medical Technologies Initiatives (TMTI) program.  The Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative’s mission is to protect the War-fighter from potent known, naturally emerging and genetically engineered threats by providing a response capability that begins with identification of pathogens and proceeds through the development of medical countermeasures.  High priority organisms include hemorrhagic fever viruses and intracellular bacteria on the CDC Category A and B high priority pathogen list.


Information Sought

Specifically, the program is interested in identifying therapeutic pathways and targets.  These pathways may include highly conserved host targets unlikely to be subverted by genetic engineering or resistance mutation such as those essential to microbial entry, intracellular pathogen survival and replication; targets that enhance innate and adaptive immunity through pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, effectively priming the immune system to safely respond; targets that attenuate common final pathways of pathogenesis, e.g. attenuation of inflammatory and coagulation cascades, and alternative mechanisms that obviate microbial resistance or genetic engineering.  In vitro and in vivo methods are also sought that experimentally validate the role of host-based pathways and drug-able targets derived from basic research efforts. Solutions from domains outside of biodefense related-research (e.g. HIV, cancer, sepsis, and trauma) are encouraged

Instructions to Responders

Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses should be limited to five (5) pages for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents. Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such.  Submitted data and information will not be returned. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DTRA from non-government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact, and contact information. 

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis/ Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for Solicitation and inquiries related to same will not receive a response.  This RFI is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award.  Any and all information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.

Only electronic submissions of information provided to the email address specified will be accepted.  RFI responses should be sent to the following email address: TMTI_TargetID@DTRA.Mil.  All emails should include in the subject line the RFI number and the submitting organization’s name.  Responses should be submitted electronically not later than 5:00 p.m. EST on 01/15/2010.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for AFI Project
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-09-AFI
<RESPDATE>102209
<ARCHDATE>10232009
<CONTACT>Traci S Leach, Phone 410-965-9539, Fax 410-965-9560, Email traci.leach@ssa.gov
<DESC>Purpose:

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research to identify firm capable of providing all necessary services to support the ongoing and expanded deployment of the SSA Access to Financial Institution (AFI) Project.  

Introduction:

SSA’s eligibility rules require that an individual’s liquid assets must be under a specified limit.  Currently, there are over 7 million SSI recipients on the SSA rolls, and approximately 2 million individuals apply for SSI each year.  In addition, SSA conducts periodic re-determinations of eligibility which include obtaining account balance information maintained by individual financial institutions (FI).

The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 permits SSA to require SSI applicants and beneficiaries to provide authorization for access to their respective FI, in order to provide verification of their financial assets.  In most states, SSA’s current process for obtaining asset verification is paper-based.  The form SSA-4641-U2, “Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Obtain Account Records From a Financial Institution and Request for Records”, is mailed to the FI and asks the FI to provide account balance information over specified time periods.

The purpose of the AFI is to convert to electronic media the information exchanges (e.g., form SSA-4641-U2) that now occur in paper form between FI and SSA; obtain titling, balance and related information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor in addition to verifying the account balance and interest income revealed by the applicant, recipient or deemor; detect unreported accounts in financial institutions located in proximity to the home address of the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor and to automate the process whereby FI are reimbursed for the cost of account verification. Interested parties must be able to deliver a web-based application that allows for the electronic transfer of account information between SSA and FI.  The application would be used to verify eligibility for SSA’s means-tested program, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  

Background:

Accuity, a SourceMedia Company, has previously created and deployed a web-based application that electronically transfers asset information between FI and SSA on a geographically-limited (i.e., California, New Jersey, and New York) basis since 2005.  
The current SSA AFI project successfully verifies financial information exchanges and detects undisclosed financial accounts to all 110 Field Offices (FO) in the states of New York and New Jersey and to a limited number of users in the Office of Quality Performance (OQP) 15 regional sites. SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services.  To SSA’s knowledge, Accuity is the only company that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers, name and social security number as the identifying information.

Current Requirements:
SSA intends to implement, enhance and deploy the AFI system nationally in incremental phases overt the next five years. Interested vendor parties with the proven capabilities to create, support, and maintain such a system that electronically transfers asset information between FI and SSA nationwide are invited to submit responses to this notice.  Responses to this notice should consist of full capabilities statements demonstrating the firm’s previous and ongoing experience in developing and/or deploying such systems, including specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. Specifically, responses must address the following items:

1.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to establish and operate a secure automated system that would electronically transfer asset information between FI and SSA on SSI applicants and beneficiaries nationwide.  The information provided to SSA must include account titling, monthly balances and interest income on all types of accounts or certificates held by SSI applicants and beneficiaries, and may include spouses and parents’ accounts.  The system must provide an interface that allows SSA users to request and receive verified asset information.  

2.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to recruit most of the nation’s FI to participate in the electronic exchange of asset information, including your ability to create a system that would interface with large numbers of FI.  Such capability would include an established relationship with the financial community.  Also, include in your response your ability to train FI personnel in using the newly-created system.

3.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to detect unreported asset information in at least 10 FI located in geographical proximity to the applicant and/or beneficiary residential address.  Include in your response your ability to increase and decrease the number of FI set in the geographical parameters, or to change the distances used in the geographical proximities. 

4.	Please demonstrate your firm’s ability to electronically reimburse FI adhering to common accounting principles for fees charged by FI for account information, as well as your ability to provide billing information to SSA.

5.	Please provide evidence that your firm is legally approved to exchange information with financial institutions.

6.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to provide SSA with comprehensive management information, program data, and analytical support related to data collected from the system.

7.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to establish a secure/dedicated facility for encrypting backups for associated data files.

Response Instructions:
Any responsible firm that feels it has the capabilities and resources to meet the requirements listed herein may respond in writing no later than October 22, 2009 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA’s objectives. Interested parties shall respond by submitting their capability statements by email to traci.leach@ssa.gov.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENTS—FINANCIAL INSTITUTION  VERIFICATION.  The Government will not pay for, nor will it return, information provided in response to this notice.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses, or lack thereof,  to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The intent of this notice is to obtain industry comments and knowledge only for the purpose of assessing the availability of qualified sources.  Recent market research has provided that only one source can satisfy the below requirement. The US Army Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), Tobyhanna, PA 18466-5100, intends to issue a sole source procurement for spare parts, repair services, and technical support services for the Common Ground Station (CGS)/Joint Services Workstation (JSWS), which is part of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, to General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), Scottsdale, AZ. The Government does not possess all of the detailed design information or specifications that any source, other than GDC4S, would need in order to produce spare parts for the CGS/JSWS that meet the Governments form, fit, and function requirements. GDC4S is the configuration manager for the CGS/JSWS and controls the design below the performance specification level.  GDC4S proprietary data, to include drawings, software, source codes, and test and calibration procedures, is needed to assure interoperability and interchangeability with CGSs/JSWSs that have been previously procured from GDC4S. Only GDC4S possesses the unique knowledge of the CGS/JSWS design and, consequently, it is the only source that can provide the required services and spare parts. The intended resulting contract will be a five (5) year Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for spare parts with Time and Materials line items for spares, and engineering services as required. This sole source procurement is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1). For further information regarding this action, please contact Joe Santillo, Contract Specialist, at 570-615-7517, joseph.santillo@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: This is a Source Sought Synopsis announcement; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL OR FAX. OBJECTIVE: The Air Force Health Facilities Division is responsible for the programming, planning, design, construction, and initial outfitting of new and renovated USAF medical treatment facilities worldwide. They are chartered with modernizing hospitals, clinics, medical office buildings, warehouses, vet clinics and wellness centers. To meet the IO requirements, the AFMS/HFD requires a contracting vehicle that utilizes experienced suppliers/vendors who are able to rapidly respond to multiple requirements, meet constrained project schedules and provide a variety of products and IO services from planning through warranty. This contract vehicle will enable the Air Force to standardize execution, minimize acquisition leadtimes and costs, work multiple projects concurrently and complete projects on schedule. Under this contract, the IO contractor shall provide 1) initial outfitting transition (IO-T) services associated with a military construction project and/or 2) provide all initial outfitting (IO) commodities to outfit new or newly renovated medical facilities with some or all of the following items:<BR>"	Resource protection / security systems<BR>"	Information technology (except computer equipment, printers, faxes, and other off-the-shelf items)<BR>"	Medical equipment and clinical casegoods<BR>"	Furniture and furnishings<BR>"	Art work<BR>"	Communication systems<BR>"	Signage	<BR><BR>Task orders will be performed in two steps. Step 1 shall be Initial Outfitting Transition (IO-T), including project management, transition/relocation planning, planning/design and technical support, product selection/planning, inventory identification, storage, movers, supervision, and budget development, tracking and adherence. Step 2 includes procurement of the product, installation labor, transportation, tools, materials, storage and freight, casegoods, furniture and furnishings equipment, artwork, signage, information technology/communication and resource protection systems. Then contract will also include the move, reconfiguration, teardown, salvage, and/or disposal of existing products and inventory storage and installation of reusable systems furniture.<BR><BR>The objective is to have a contractor provide turn-key services to provide interior design, medical equipment, furniture, casegoods, communication equipment, information technology hardware and software, and furnishings for MTFs world-wide. These services must include cradle to grave project management services, design services, procurement of furniture and medical/clinical casegoods, warehousing capabilities, delivery, installation, inventory, warranty services, commissioning and training on all new equipment/furniture. The following are questions/concerns of the Government: (1) The contract should be world-wide with no division between U.S. regions and overseas. (2) The Government would like to have the flexibility to include furniture layout design services if we need them as we will not always be able to provide a Comprehensive Interior Design (CID). (3) The Government would like to have the option to reconfigure, restore or replace existing furniture components. The selected contractor will assist in assessing the condition and reusability of the existing furnishings. (4) The Government would want the ability to trade-in existing furniture for credit. (5) Vendors would be responsible for providing training on all new equipment. (6) The Government would like industry input as to the best way to make this turn-key operation work. (7) The Government would like industry to suggest ways to issue a single task order for a mix of furniture without running up against the barrier of dealer-exclusive relationships. Faxed responses to this request are preferred and should be sent to Fax Number (817) 886-6403, ATTN: Ed Chambers. Any email response to this request should be sent to edward.a.chambers@usace.army.mil. <BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, PO Box 17300/819 Taylor Street, Fort Worth, TX 76102-0300 <BR>817-886-1070<BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  The Europe Region originally completed this product line in conjunction with Drapes & Gowns for standardization in 2004 and it expires December 31, 2009.  The Kimberly-Clark Corporation was the vendor for the previous RIA award.  The Europe Region Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) decided to separate the Drapes and Gowns product line into three product lines, Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns, Surgical Drapes, and Surgical Gowns.  The Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns must be in compliance with the guidelines established by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which involves the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HIPAC) and the Departments Steering Committee for the Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) recommended infection control technology that is proven to reduce infections at the same time providing patient comfort and clinical performance.  Products will conform to the levels of barrier protection by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) PB70:2003 guidelines for Liquid Barrier Performance and Classification of Protection Apparel and Drapes Intended for use in Health Care Facilities.  The disposable Isolation Gowns & Patient Exam Gowns must be comfortable, strong, durable, have increased levels of protection (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, AAMI Levels 1-4) must have flame resistance, and be abrasion resistant having the lowest lint particles.<BR>1.	At a minimum this includes disposable Isolation Gowns in the following sizes, styles, and levels of protection.<BR>1.	Isolation gowns with fluid resistant open back elastic wrist universal heavy, medium weight.<BR>2.	Isolation gowns with fluid resistant full back knit cuff in the sizes universal and XL.<BR>3.	Isolation gowns with polypropylene full back knit cuff in the sizes LG and XL.<BR>4.	Isolation gowns with impervious open back thumb loop wrist in the size universal.<BR>2.	At a minimum this also includes disposable Patient Exam Gowns in size adult regular/large<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is December 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $202,969.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum this includes disposable Isolation Gowns in the following sizes, styles, and levels of protection<BR>1.	Isolation gowns with fluid resistant open back, elastic wrist, heavy and medium weight, size universal.<BR>2.	Isolation gowns with fluid resistant, full back, knit cuff, sizes universal and XL.<BR>3.

Patient Exam Gowns, size adult regular and adult LG.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.

Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the nine (9) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line three (3) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The criteria will be evaluated during a seven (7) calendar day period of time involving three (3) trials for all the disposable Isolation & Patient Exam Gowns conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>Isolation Gowns<BR>1.	(Product performance)  The isolation gowns level of barrier protection is readily identifiable on the gown and the packaging.  <BR>a.	The level of barrier protection for the isolation gown must be identifiable allowing the clinician to wear the proper gown for the procedure being performed.<BR>b.	Each isolation gown will be visually inspected making sure the level of barrier protection is provided on the gown and the packaging of the gown.<BR>2.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The isolation gown has adequate barrier protection and resists saturation and any penetration of liquids (fluid strikethoughs).<BR>a.	The isolation gown must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain protection for the patient and the clinician during the clinical procedure. <BR>b.	The isolation gown will be inspected during and after the clinical procedure process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness (fluid strikethroughs).<BR>3.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The isolation gown does not tear and/or perforate during the clinical procedure.<BR>a.	The isolation gown must effectively resist tears and/or perforations in order to maintain protection of the patient and the clinician during the clinical procedure.<BR>b.	The isolation gown will be inspected during and after the clinical procedure process cycle for visual signs of tears or perforations.<BR>4.	(Product performance)  The construction of the isolation gown is of good quality.  <BR>a.	The isolation gowns construction must have limited memory, is flexible enough to conform loosely to the clinicians body, is lightweight, has breathability, and has a pleasant odor.<BR>b.	Each isolation gown will be donned according to the manufacturers guidelines and examined for comfort, breathability, weight, conformity to the clinicians body, and any unpleasant odor.<BR><BR>Patient Exam Gowns<BR>1.	(Product performance)  The barrier protection level of the patient exam gown is readily identifiable on the gown and packaging.<BR>a.	The level of barrier protection for the patient exam gown must be identifiable allowing the clinician to wear the proper gown for the procedure being performed.<BR>b.	Each patient exam gown will be visually inspected making sure the level of barrier protection is provided on the gown and the packaging of the gown.<BR>2.	(Product performance)  The construction of the patient exam gown is of good quality.<BR>a.	The construction of the patient exam gown must have limited memory, is flexible enough to conform loosely to the patients body, is lightweight, has breathability, and has a pleasant odor.<BR>b.	Each patent exam gown will be donned according to the manufacturers guidelines and examined for comfort, breathability, weight, conformity to the patients body, and any unpleasant odor.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Surgical Gowns and Accessories for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  The Europe Region originally completed this product line in conjunction with Surgical Drapes for standardization in 2004 and it expires December 31, 2009.  The Kimberly-Clark Corporation was the vendor for the previous RIA award.  The Europe Region Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) decided to separate the Drapes and Gowns product line into three product lines, Surgical Gowns and Accessories, Surgical Drapes, and Isolation and Patient Exam Gowns.  The Surgical Gowns and Accessories that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and must be in compliance with the guidelines established by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which involves the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HIPAC) and the Departments Steering Committee for the Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) recommended infection control technology that is proven to reduce infections at the same time providing patient comfort and clinical performance.  Products will conform to the levels of barrier protection by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) PB70:2003 guidelines for Liquid Barrier Performance and Classification of Protection Apparel and Drapes Intended for use in Health Care Facilities.  The Surgical Gowns and Accessories product line includes coveralls, aprons, shoe covers, and head covers.  At a minimum this includes disposable Surgical Gowns and Accessories that must be comfortable, strong, durable, have increased levels of protection (AAMI Levels 1-4) must have flame resistance, be abrasion resistant having the lowest lint particles and are manufactured in the following range of sizes, styles, and range of protection.<BR>1.	Surgical Gowns and Accessories reinforced LG, XL 2XL.<BR>2.	Surgical Gowns and Accessories impervious XL.<BR>3.	Surgical Gowns and Accessories non-reinforced XL.<BR>4.	Surgical Gowns and Accessories reinforced impervious 2XL.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Surgical Gowns and Accessories.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S.

Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is December 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Gowns and Accessories, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $386,205.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum this includes disposable Surgical Gowns and Accessories that must be comfortable, strong, durable, have increased levels of protection (AAMI Levels 1-4) must have flame resistance, be abrasion resistant having the lowest lint particles and are manufactured in the following range of sizes, styles, and range of protection.<BR>1.

All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region.

Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the nine (9) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line three (3) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The criteria will be evaluated during a seven (7) calendar day period of time involving three (3) trials for all the disposable Surgical Gowns and Accessories conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR><BR>1.	(Product performance)  The surgical gowns level of barrier protection is readily identifiable on the gown and packaging.  <BR>a.	The level of barrier protection for the surgical gown must be identifiable allowing the clinician to wear the proper gown for the surgical procedure being performed.<BR>b.	Each surgical gown will be visually inspected making sure the level of barrier protection is provided on the gown and the gowns packaging.<BR>2.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The surgical gown has adequate barrier protection and resists saturation and any penetration of liquids (fluid strikethoughs).<BR>a.	The surgical gown must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain sterility and protect the clinician during the operating procedure. <BR>b.	The surgical gown will be inspected during and after the surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness (fluid strikethoughs).<BR>3.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The surgical gown does not tear and/or perforate during the surgical procedure.<BR>a.	The surgical gown must effectively resist tears and/or perforations in order to maintain sterility and protect the clinician during the operating procedure.<BR>b.	The surgical gown will be inspected during and after the surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of tears or perforations.<BR><BR><BR>4.	(Product performance)  The construction of the surgical gown is of good quality.  <BR>a.	The surgical gowns construction must have limited memory, is flexible enough to conform loosely to the clinicians body, is lightweight, has breathability, and has a pleasant odor.<BR>b.	Each surgical gown will be donned according to the manufacturers guidelines and examined for comfort, breathability, weight, conformity to the clinicians body, and any unpleasant odor.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.<BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Surgical Drapes for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  The Europe Region originally completed this product line in conjunction with Surgical Gowns for standardization in 2004 and it expires December 31, 2009.  The Kimberly Clark Corporation was the vendor for the previous RIA award.  The Europe Region Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) decided to separate the Drapes and Gowns product line into three product lines, Surgical Drapes, Surgical Gowns, and Isolation and Patient Exam Gowns.  The Surgical Drapes product group includes operating room table covers and Mayo stand covers.  The Surgical Drapes must be in compliance with the guidelines established by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which involves the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HIPAC) and the Departments Steering Committee for the Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) recommended infection control technology that is proven to reduce infections at the same time providing patient comfort and clinical performance.  Products will conform to the levels of barrier protection by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) PB70:2003 guidelines for Liquid Barrier Performance and Classification of Protection Apparel and Drapes Intended for use in Health Care Facilities.  This product line includes a full line of disposable, strong, durable, have sound drape ability, and flame and abrasion resistant Surgical Drapes.  At a minimum this includes disposable Surgical Drapes in the following range of sizes and styles.  The sizes are approximate understanding that companies manufacture slightly (+/- 2-3 inches) different sized product items.<BR>1.	Drape Surgical Sheet 60x76 inches fan fold.<BR>2.	Drape Surgical U-drape 47x51 inches.<BR>3.	Drape Surgical Fenestrated laparotomy.<BR>4.	Drape Surgical Split strip 77x120 inches.<BR>5.	Drape Surgical Sheet 56x77 inches reinforced.<BR>6.	Drape Surgical Extremity fenestrated reinforced tube holder.<BR>7.	Drape Surgical Extremity fenestrated reinforced arm board covers tube holder.<BR>8.	Drape Surgical Circle aperture 15 ]x15 ] inches.<BR>9.	Drape Surgical Neuro fenestrated adhesive window reinforced pouch with drawstring tube holder.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Surgical Drapes.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the Europe Region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is December 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.

Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>1.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>2.

The disposable Surgical Drapes samples: Three (3) of each size/style/level of protection as stated below per each of the nine (9) MTFs as follows.<BR>(1)	Drape surgical sheet (disposable) impervious approximately 60x76in (also known as 3/4 drape sheet) fan fold.<BR>(2)	Drape surgical U-drape adhesive strip impervious (disposable) approximately 47x51in.<BR>(3)	Drape surgical extremity fenestrated reinforced/impervious tube holder.<BR>b.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  NOTE:  The Europe Region TRBO shipping address is stated in item #1 above.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the nine (9) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line three (3) times.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The criteria will be evaluated during a seven (7) calendar day period of time involving three (3) trials for all the disposable Surgical Drapes conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR><BR>1.	(Product performance)  The surgical drapes folding, drape ability, and flexibility allow the product to function properly in the operating room.  <BR>a.	The surgical drape must be able to conform loosely to the patients body during the operating procedure without compromising sterility.<BR>b.	Each surgical drape will be applied according to manufacturers guidelines, and visually inspected for folding, drape ability, memory (drape stays unfolded and in place when applied), and conformity.<BR>2.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The surgical drape resists saturation and any penetration of liquids.<BR>a.	The surgical drape must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain sterility during the operating procedure. <BR>b.	The surgical drape will be inspected during the surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness (fluid strikethroughs).<BR>3.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) The surgical drape does not tear and/or perforate during the surgical procedure.<BR>a.	The surgical drape must effectively resist tears and/or perforations to maintain sterility during the operating procedure.<BR>b.	The surgical drape will be inspected during the surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of tears and perforations.<BR>4.	(Product performance)  The construction of the surgical drape is of good quality.  <BR>a.	The surgical drapes construction must have the correct fenestration size for the surgical procedure, critical areas around the fenestration must be reinforced, and the construction must have the lowest lint particles possible.<BR>b.	Each surgical drape will be visually inspected for fenestration size, lint free quality; the incision opening (fenestration/aperture) has good adhesion.<BR>5.  (Safety in Urgent Care Setting) - Packaging identifies the surgical drape which includes the size and other product descriptions for the surgical drape.<BR>a.	The ability to quickly and accurately identify the item and its contents reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient care needs.<BR>a.	Evaluator will visually inspect the package label making sure the contents information properly identifies the respective surgical drape.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.

Contracting Office Address:Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research to collect information from industry regarding availability of next generation military combat helmet systems that offer enhanced capabilities over the Marine Corps' current Lightweight Helmet (LWH) and ongoing Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) (with similar geometry to Advanced Combat Helmet) systems.  The Marine Corps is seeking information on next generation complete helmet systems encompassing potentially new helmet shells (including innovative geometries, design changes or alterations, and materials), retention systems, and suspension systems.  These next generation systems shall exhibit improved, balanced protection against blast, ballistic, and blunt impact threats, offer improved human ergonomics, such as stability and comfort, and offer improved installation/application/integration capabilities with existing and future head borne devices, such as suspension and retention systems, night vision goggles, optics, flashlights, masks, etc.  Industry is encouraged to submit innovative designs and ideas for any or all components of this next generation helmet system.     
Background: Military combat helmet designs have changed infrequently over the past several decades.  Many of the more recent changes involved material changes to improve ballistic protection.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE) is seeking alternative or new combat helmet system designs that offer improved, yet balanced, blast, ballistic, and blunt impact protection as well as increased human ergonomics and combat equipment integration.  PM ICE is interested in all design concepts at this stage, to include new combat helmet geometries, integrated or specially designed retention and suspension systems, and other concepts that may offer these improvements.  PM ICE is also interested in gaining an understanding of the analysis, modeling and simulation, test and evaluation and any other data that led to each new design.  Finally, PM ICE is also interested in learning about modeling and simulation tools that may be available to evaluate new designs against the factors noted above.   
In response to this RFI, interested parties are asked to provide the following information regarding their candidate systems: model number/name, system specifications, available test data, per unit cost, weight, production readiness or current production capacity, picture or CAD drawing of candidate system, a point of contact, and lead time to provide a prototype unit for evaluation.  Respondents may also provide product samples with their response if they are available.  Offerors with solutions in the design phase shall also include estimated timeframes to reach a prototype stage.  Any information marked "Proprietary" will not be shared outside of the government.  Interested parties with multiple candidate systems are encouraged to submit information on all available items or products.  The collection of this information does not constitute MCSC or PM ICE approval of any proposed product.    
Vendors who believe they have a product capable of meeting these requirements are requested to provide product literature, brochures, price lists, warranty coverage, business size, production capabilities, and any other relevant information.  Quantity and funding availability are unknown at this time.  The Berry Amendment will apply to any contractual instruments regarding future procurement actions resulting from this RFI.  In response to this RFI, interested parties are requested to submit the data electronically to andrew.fonda@usmc.mil. No telephone calls will be accepted. Product samples can be mailed to: Marine Corps Systems Command, 2201A Willis St., Quantico, Va. 22134-6050, Attn: Andrew Fonda.  Materials or products submitted will not be returned.  Submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information or samples received.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of this RFI.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.  No solicitation document exists. Responses and product samples are due no later than 3 November 2009.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Mercer, Inc. for Pension Administration Services. The period of performance is for six months.  PBGC is legally required to assume trusteeship of the Retirement Plan of Circuit City Stores, Inc. as a result of bankruptcy of the Circuit City Stores, Inc. This prior administration support provided by Mercer to Circuit City Stores, Inc. will no longer be available after September 23, 2009 (120 days after trusteeship) due to PBGC procurement requirements.  In order to ensure that future retirement calculations can be completed accurately and timely PBGC will require the services of Mercer for a short period after trusteeship.  

This action will be a one time contract for highly technical customized plan-specific services relating to the Retirement Plan of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (The Plan).  These services will be for pension administration expertise, detailed knowledge of participant data and complex participant calculation about “The Plan.”  These services are necessary to enable PBGC to assume trusteeship of “The Plan” and ensure that customer service standards, of uninterrupted payment of benefits to retirees and future payees, are met during initial trusteeship of “The Plan.”

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but a Notice of Intent. No RFP will be issued.  Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later than 10:00 AM eastern time, September 23, 2009) by email to the Contracting Officer, Patrick McFarlane at mcfarlane.patrick@pbgc.gov.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 4,429 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Austin/Mower County, MN, that will expire September 30, 2009.  The lease term requirement is five years.  The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2009.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North-County 45 and I 90		East-Cty 58 
South-Oakland, Cty  45 and Cty 3	West-I 90 / 218 N.

Other applicable requirements include:
	
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)

-	Parking – 50 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. However, such capability information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct future procurements of this nature on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the government in accordance with the authority prescribed in FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The NF/SG Veterans Healthcare System, Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center, 1601 SW Archer Road, Gainesville, FL 32608 intends to negotiate with Tornier Inc, on a sole source basis pursuant to VAAR 873 & 38 USC 8153 and FAR 6.302-1 for the DVO Solutions Hand Tray Kit (DVO-101). The Cover Loc technology allows fragments to be lagged to the plate for greater construct stability and allows screw placement at pre-determined anatomic angles. The optimized plate profile enables maximum distal placement of the plate to buttress volar-ulnar fragments without stuffing the compartment.  The optimized plate profile includes an anatomic volar tilt angle that allows for a more distal placement of the plate. With the raised ulnar portion of the plate the difficult volar-ulnar fragments are more easily buttressed and the tapered distal lip avoids overstuffing the compartment.  The distal and proximal holes are arranged to provide optimal subchondral bone support while also providing a secure interlocking basket effect.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number is 339112. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature to the Contracting Officer no later than September 23, 2009 at 4:00pm EST.

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause), 5352-242-9000, Access To Air Force Installations.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The State Departments broadcast television production facilities at Main State and the FPC are unique, state-of-the-art hybrid digital/analog platforms that include custom designed equipment for specialized applications. In such a custom-designed facility, diversity of brands and models severely drives up total cost of ownership (TCO). Staff must be trained on procedures specific to each brand of broadcast equipment. The broadcast facility has used Ikegami as the standard broadcast CRT monitor for nearly 10 years, and staff have extensive expertise in their calibration and use. These monitors are replacing existing inventory, enabling the myriad of connections for SDI digital and analog video signals, sync and tally to remain the same, as well as the dimensions for rack mounting. The availability of broadcast CRT monitors has been significantly reduced and manufactures are phasing this technology out for LCD technology because of High Definition technology because of the need to reach a global audience that often does not use this platform. Ikegami is not phasing this technology out and is positioned to support it for the next product life cycle. When manufacturer support is required to repair a broadcast CRT monitor, all support calls go to the same place for any of the monitor inventory. When any of the monitors need to be taken out of service for maintenance or sent out for repair, they can easily be swapped or replaced by the other Ikegami monitors in inventory.<BR><BR>

Solicitation Number:  FDA1060796

Response Date: 4 August 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541910 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following data and service: 

Medical Device Exposure Dataset Identification and Evaluation

Background:

FDA routinely obtains reports of adverse events occurring throughout the life-cycle of medical devices.  These reports come from the sponsor in the IDE prior to device marketing.  Upon clearance/approval of the device, reports may come from a post-approval study (PAS) or through medical device reports (MDRs).  As opposed to the well documented exposure information in the IDE study, post-marketing exposure to medical devices is difficult to ascertain.  It is often limited to information from passive surveillance or from single-institution case series analysis.

Knowing the number of individuals exposed to a medical device is key to many of FDA’s post-marketing efforts to determine whether public safety is maintained throughout the device life-cycle.  Use of exposure data would allow FDA to know the proportion of device users reporting adverse events via MDRs.  It would also allow FDA to determine whether post approval studies have difficulty recruiting due to slow device uptake.  In the event of potential safety signals for a medical device, exposure data would allow FDA to determine the number of people potentially affected by the adverse event as well as whether adequate substitutes for a medical device are present in the marketplace in the event of a recall.

Representative, nationwide data for medical device utilization at the manufacturer and device-specific levels would offer the opportunity to derive more accurate rates of outcomes.  To address this need for better information, FDA is asking for identification and evaluation of potential data sources for exposure to medical devices in the United States.  For this initial assessment, data focused in on of three areas is requested.  The areas of specific interest are gastroenterology/urology/renal, infection control/dental/general hospital/infusion pumps, or neurology/anesthesia/respiratory.

Objectives:

By the end of this evaluation of potential data sources, our objective is to identify the most appropriate medical device exposure dataset(s) available for purchase by or collaboration with FDA to assist with ongoing post-market device safety evaluation.

Scope of Work:

The scope of work of this project is the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. data measuring exposure to commercial medical devices.  Data evaluated in this project should be representative of the population exposed to the devices or able to be extrapolated to represent use in the U.S. population. 

This project shall require a thorough analysis of each set of identified data: (1) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (2) method of data collection and extrapolation to US population; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up (if any) and capture of care across all settings; (4) plans for further enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of data compilers or investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of data, including HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of data; (7) cost of data and updates; and (8) potential barriers that exist to government use of data.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the June 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 511210. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and NO additional written solicitation will be issued.<br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Kitware on a sole source basis.<br /><br />Background:<br />The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) is an open source software system for performing segmentation, registration and analysis of medical images. It has become the de facto standard in research labs at universities, small businesses, and the top commercial medical device manufacturing companies. There are reports that ITK is being used in multiple clinical products including surgical planning and surgical guidance systems.<br />The NLM, along with other partnering NIH institutes, funded the creation of ITK starting in 1999 at a total investment of $13M over the initial five years of its development. Six principal sites were chosen to develop ITK: Kitware Inc., GE Global Research, Insightful Inc., the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Utah, with subcontracts to Harvard Brigham and Women's Hospital, University of Pittsburgh, and Columbia University. Approximately fifty developers located at these sites contributed code and documentation to the toolkit. <br />ITK has an active community of developers and users. The ITK is supported on over 42 different programming environments spanning multiple versions of Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, SunOS, and others. It consists of over 1,600 C++ classes that are also accessible from Java, TK/TCL, and Python. Over the past ten years, algorithms have been contributed to ITK by over 30 groups located around the world. Its users' email list averages over 450 postings per month. The ITK software guide, which consists of hundreds of examples that teach programmers how to use ITK, has over 830 pages. That software guide has been downloaded over 34,000 times in the past five years, and it is viewed online over 3,000 times per month. ITK is typically downloaded over 11,000 times every three months. It has been estimated that over 80% of the papers presented at the 2008 Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference used ITK. The Insight Journal, an Open Access journal that hosts community contributions to the Insight Toolkit, has over 1,250 subscribers, 350 publications and 750 reviews. The most downloaded papers from the Journal have been downloaded over 2,000 times. These papers provide contributions of new classes and algorithms to ITK.<br />Kitware has received funding for the past five years to provide maintenance and support for ITK and its community. Our efforts include the following:<br /><br />1. ITK Community Support<br />&bull; Provide servers that host ITK code, wiki pages, web pages, email lists, dashboards, and other web-based community tools.<br />&bull; Monitor and answer the majority of questions posted on the ITK users' and developers' email lists.<br />&bull; Provide slides to presenters and make presentations ourselves on the use and benefits of ITK. Recent presentations include a technology course at RSNA 2008 and open-source workshops in three different countries as well as the US.<br /><br />2. ITK Code Support<br />&bull; Provide and maintain over fifteen computer systems that test ITK every night. These systems monitor the operation of ITK for a multitude of programming environments.<br />&bull; Track the resolution of and often provide the actual solutions for errors in ITK that are reported by users.<br />&bull; Generate stable releases of ITK at regular intervals to ease its adoption by new users.<br /><br />3. ITK Development Support<br />&bull; Host weekly developers' conference calls to discuss the needs, shortcomings, and future directions of the toolkit.<br />&bull; Operate and serve as editors and associate editors for the Insight Journal - the open-access journal that is companion to ITK and the conduit by which new methods for ITK are proposed.<br />&bull; Organize and, in many cases, conduct the movement of popular methods from the Insight Journal into ITK and its companion Insight Applications repository.
<p>Specifications:</p>
<p>The services to be performed during the next year build upon the successful strategy we have been following. The services to be performed include the following: <br /><br />1. ITK Community Support<br />&bull; Provide the servers that host ITK's web-based community tools.<br />&bull; Monitor and answer questions posted on the ITK users' and developers' email lists.<br />&bull; Help organize, advertise, and present at a 3-day course at the NLM that will provide programmers with the background materials and methods needed to continue the design, development, and support of ITK.<br /><br />2. ITK Code Support<br />&bull; Provide and maintain computer systems that test ITK every night for a multitude of programming environments.<br />&bull; Track the resolution of and often provide the actual solutions for errors in ITK that are reported by users.<br />&bull; Generate a stable release of ITK with an emphasis on ensuring the longevity of that release.<br /><br />3. ITK Development Support<br />&bull; Host weekly developers' conference calls to discuss the needs, shortcomings, and future directions of the toolkit.<br />&bull; Operate and serve as editors and associate editors for the Insight Journal.<br />&bull; Organize and, in many cases, conduct the movement of popular methods from the Insight Journal into ITK and its companion InsightApplications repository.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br /><br />The period of performance will be for one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>The Insight Toolkit has succeeded because an active community has formed around it. New users are engaged in presentations and on the email lists. Questions are rapidly answered on users' and developers' lists to reduce the learning curve. A massive collection of web-based resources are available to learn about the toolkit and support its distributed development and testing. All of the above are being led by Kitware who is unique in having 10 years of experience with designing, developing, and maintaining ITK and is thereby well known, respected, and trusted by the community of developers.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the computer systems, servers, expertise, and reputation held by Kitware for the support and development of the ITK community is unmatched in the industry. Without argument, no other single group can provide the depth and breadth of expertise and historical knowledge that is essential to serving the ITK community. Kitware is also prized for its reputation in supporting open-source software, and the value of that reputation in regards to convincing users and developers of the continued stability and openness of ITK cannot be over stated.</p>

The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.<BR>GOOD<BR>The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no deficiencies and any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.<BR>SATISFACTORY<BR>The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of successfully meeting the requirements.<BR>MARGINAL<BR>The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <BR>UNSATISFACTORY<BR>The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions, weaknesses or deficiencies, and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is September 28, 2009, 3:00 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>This Solicitation has been amended to include the following questions and answers:
The submit date has NOT been extended.


Q:  On this bid you have one Speco 5-50mm lens and nine cameras.  If the cameras have a built in lens and cannot be switched how big do you want the lenses to be on them?  
A:  SO-HTINTD9 is also a camera but is a fixed dome; Speco Intensifier Dome
Camera,5-50mm Ai Vf Lens Grey HTINTD9 CCTV Fixed Dome Camera so there will be 10 Cameras total.  The SOW will be adjusted to reflect this.
Q:  Also I was trying to find the Speco part numbers you have.  The first part number SAMLNT4042H I cannot find anywhere, and the second is a part number for a Speco dome camera with a 9-22mm lens in it yet the description in the project materials says “Speco 5-50mm Lens.”  Can you clarify this?
A:  SAMLNT4042H does not exist on the combo or the SOW.  Ensure you are reading the correct solicitation.  SO-HTINTD9 is also a camera but is a fixed dome; Speco Intensifier Dome Camera,5-50mm Ai Vf Lens Grey HTINTD9 CCTV Fixed Dome Camera.  The SOW will be adjusted to reflect this.
Q:   How many buildings will be involved in the Job?

A:  Approx 13,470sf
Q:  The second part number is SO-HTINTD9 with a description of Speco 5-50mm Lens.  SO-HTINTD9 is actually a full camera not just the lens.  Did you want the camera it self with that lens or was it supposed to be a HT-INTD camera with a bigger lens.  
A:  SO-HTINTD9 is also a camera but is a fixed dome; Speco Intensifier Dome Camera,5-50mm Ai Vf Lens Grey HTINTD9 CCTV Fixed Dome Camera.  The SOW will be adjusted to reflect this.
Q:  By “compatible” do you mean the same? Or what is your definition of compatible?
A:  Compatible would be something that is like the current system and can be added to it.

A:  There is no audio involved in the project.  SOW will be edited.
Q:  What Video projection?
A:  There is no video projection involved in the project. SOW will be edited.
Q:  Who will have the area we wish to trench in marked? Okie dig or the air base?
A:  There will not be a need for trenching.  All cameras will be mounted to bldg 1866.

<p>This is a small business set aside under NAICS code 333924</p>
<p>the hoist needs to have a capacity of 6<br />tons, (2 ea 3 ton hoists on a single bridge beam). Each hoist must have<br />independent control and be able to used together or separately, and run the<br />length of the bridge beam. The lifting height needs to be 19 feet. The<br />span of the bridge must be 50 feet and the runway beams need to be 80<br />feet long. The bridge beam should run the entire length of the runway beams.<br />The entire assembly must be supported from below. Due to the age and<br />construction of the existing building, the crane cannot be supported by the<br />building structure. Also, there are metal cables that run parallel in the<br />floor every 20 feet that hold the exterior walls to each other to prevent<br />the structure from collapsing (domed roof structure), so the pillars or<br />columns that hold up the runway beams need to be at intervals that do not<br />interfere with the existing cables in the floor. These columns need to be free standing and not have kickers that could interfere with the work flow.&nbsp; The control power for the<br />hoist is 120 Volt and the power supply is 460/3/60. The entire assembly must<br />also meet all UT safety and seismic requirements.</p>
<p>Concrete footers needed on the ground to attach hoist assembly support<br />columns will be installed by CSCI if they get the specifications by 30 Sep<br />09.</p>
</p>
<p><br />A site visit will be available on Monday September 21 10:00 MST. All questions should go through Jason Grove 801 775 2371.</p>

<DESC><strong>Questions &amp; Answers</strong><br /><br />1. Is the amount of time only limited to 1 day for each functional area needed to be completed and at the end of 8 days the entire 7.1 application is to be installed and configured?
<p>A: Not sure what is meant by "functional area" but yes at the end of the 8 days it is expected that the entire 7.1 application be installed and configured.</p>
<p>2. Who is the incumbent performing the work at the moment?</p>
<p>A: Local administration (The customer)</p>
<p>3. Is 7.1 already installed at all in either a Development of Test Environment?</p>
<p>A: No</p>
<p>4. Being as though the timeline is so aggressive is this is a new installation and complete configuration or has some of the work been completed already and the Government is looking for additional support?</p>
<p>A: This is a new installation</p>
<p>5. Who is doing sustainment of the BMC application after this is installed?</p>
<p>A: Local sustainment unless we want to pay for continued support, we assumed it would be local though.</p>
<p>6. Is there an option for a company to provide continual sustainment and administrative support of the application once configured?</p>
<p>A: Sure, if we can afford it. We did expect to be able to have phone support at least.</p>
<p>7. If the timeline is limited to the information available on the site can the server configurations prior to the contractor sending in a bid or the start of the project?</p>
<p>A: We can get the hardware installed and the OS / SQL installed prior to the 7.1 install by the vendor.</p>
<p>Overall: This [is] to be treated as though there was no 7.1 in existence. The vendor would help install the application and migrate the data from our 5.1 platform to the new 7.1.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response Date Extended to 23 Sep 09.</strong></span></p>

Solicitation Number:  FDA1060796

Response Date: 14 August 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541910 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following data and service: 

Medical Device Exposure Dataset Identification and Evaluation

Background:

FDA routinely obtains reports of adverse events occurring throughout the life-cycle of medical devices.  These reports come from the sponsor in the IDE prior to device marketing.  Upon clearance/approval of the device, reports may come from a post-approval study (PAS) or through medical device reports (MDRs).  As opposed to the well documented exposure information in the IDE study, post-marketing exposure to medical devices is difficult to ascertain.  It is often limited to information from passive surveillance or from single-institution case series analysis.

Knowing the number of individuals exposed to a medical device is key to many of FDA’s post-marketing efforts to determine whether public safety is maintained throughout the device life-cycle.  Use of exposure data would allow FDA to know the proportion of device users reporting adverse events via MDRs.  It would also allow FDA to determine whether post approval studies have difficulty recruiting due to slow device uptake.  In the event of potential safety signals for a medical device, exposure data would allow FDA to determine the number of people potentially affected by the adverse event as well as whether adequate substitutes for a medical device are present in the marketplace in the event of a recall.

Representative, nationwide data for medical device utilization at the manufacturer and device-specific levels would offer the opportunity to derive more accurate rates of outcomes.  To address this need for better information, FDA is asking for identification and evaluation of potential data sources for exposure to medical devices in the United States.  For this initial assessment, data focused in on of three areas is requested.  The areas of specific interest are gastroenterology/urology/renal, infection control/dental/general hospital/infusion pumps, or neurology/anesthesia/respiratory.

Objectives:

By the end of this evaluation of potential data sources, our objective is to identify the most appropriate medical device exposure dataset(s) available for purchase by or collaboration with FDA to assist with ongoing post-market device safety evaluation.

Scope of Work:

The scope of work of this project is the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. data measuring exposure to commercial medical devices.  Data evaluated in this project should be representative of the population exposed to the devices or able to be extrapolated to represent use in the U.S. population. 

This project shall require a thorough analysis of each set of identified data: (1) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (2) method of data collection and extrapolation to US population; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up (if any) and capture of care across all settings; (4) plans for further enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of data compilers or investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of data, including HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of data; (7) cost of data and updates; and (8) potential barriers that exist to government use of data.

Upon clearance/approval of the device, reports may come from a post-approval study (PAS) or through medical device reports (MDRs).  As opposed to the well documented exposure information in the IDE study, post-marketing exposure to medical devices is difficult to ascertain.  It is often limited to information from passive surveillance or from single-institution case series analysis.

Knowing the number of individuals exposed to a medical device is key to many of FDA’s post-marketing efforts to determine whether public safety is maintained throughout the device life-cycle.  Use of exposure data would allow FDA to know the proportion of device users reporting adverse events via MDRs.  It would also allow FDA to determine whether post approval studies have difficulty recruiting due to slow device uptake.  In the event of potential safety signals for a medical device, exposure data would allow FDA to determine the number of people potentially affected by the adverse event as well as whether adequate substitutes for a medical device are present in the marketplace in the event of a recall.

Representative, nationwide data for medical device utilization at the manufacturer and device-specific levels would offer the opportunity to derive more accurate rates of outcomes.  To address this need for better information, FDA is asking for identification and evaluation of potential data sources for exposure to medical devices in the United States.  For this initial assessment, data focused in on of three areas is requested.  The areas of specific interest are gastroenterology/urology/renal, infection control/dental/general hospital/infusion pumps, or neurology/anesthesia/respiratory.

Objectives:

By the end of this evaluation of potential data sources, our objective is to identify the most appropriate medical device exposure dataset(s) available for purchase by or collaboration with FDA to assist with ongoing post-market device safety evaluation.

Scope of Work:

The scope of work of this project is the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. data measuring exposure to commercial medical devices.  Data evaluated in this project should be representative of the population exposed to the devices or able to be extrapolated to represent use in the U.S. population. 

This project shall require a thorough analysis of each set of identified data: (1) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (2) method of data collection and extrapolation to US population; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up (if any) and capture of care across all settings; (4) plans for further enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of data compilers or investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of data, including HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of data; (7) cost of data and updates; and (8) potential barriers that exist to government use of data.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Ai! r Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees. Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Ai! r Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

This announcement supersedes all previous posts. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.<br /><br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for providing Operations Support and Studies for the US National Data Center (US NDC) program.&nbsp; This posting is NOT for the Phase 4 development of the US NDC System.<br /></span><br />The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this effort is to fine-tune the current system by optimization of software algorithms through Scientific and Engineering studies, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p>The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.<br /><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p>Current System Parameters include the following:<br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g, ClearQuest/ClearCase, Tuxedo, Net Vault, Trusted Gateway System<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p>The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p>Contractor responsibility will include the sustainment and integration of a total system including correction and implementation of fixes to software problems, on-going software and hardware upgrades, and advanced/on-going tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of ongoing US NDC sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1) One of the primary objectives of this effort is to sustain a software and hardware architecture to include complete configuration management which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p>2) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p>3) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p>4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p>5) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p>6) Studies</p>
<p>a) Conduct engineering/scientific studies to help optimize/tune detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.</p>
<p>b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.</p>
<p>All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. It is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. The estimated contract cost for this effort is approximately $10M - $15M and is anticipated to be a 4-year contract (basic with three 1-year options).

<DESC>Title: Biomedical Computing Support Services for Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG )

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice (SS). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. 

The NAICS code for this project is 541511. 

The small business size standard is $25M. 

Background: 

The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG’s) research focuses on discovering genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and identifying new approaches to cancer prevention. This project is for the renewal of contract N02-CP-31003 with Information Management Services, which was awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period with two additional award term years. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NCI. 

Purpose: 

The purpose of the support will be to provide routine as well as specialized services for the DCEG’s biomedical data management, analytic, and systems and web development needs for ongoing and new molecular epidemiologic and genetic studies of populations. The NCI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein. Based on the responses received from this SBSS notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NCI’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  

Project Requirements: 

The project will require a contractor to manage and coordinate staff in support of varied and simultaneous biomedical related projects of variable population size (hundred to several hundred thousand individuals) and complexity (data from molecular and environmental exposures, complex study designs, and multiple data sources etc). Specifically, the project will provide computing support for its biostatisticians, epidemiologists, geneticists and other DCEG professionals. This computer-related support falls into four main categories: 

(1) Biomedical Data management activities includes several biomedical data management-related tasks, including appropriate manual and automated secure processes to enter, store, and retrieve study data and documentation for environmental and molecular epidemiology and genetics studies;

(2) Statistical Programming, Analysis, Reporting, and Infrastructure Services includes providing support for programming to streamline analyses, performing environmental and molecular epidemiology and genetics study data analyses as directed by DCEG investigators, developing new statistical methods and study-design development, and for report and  manuscript preparation;

(3) Systems Design, Development, and Maintenance support will be required for study data management, statistical analysis and science administration processes such as budget tracking and;

(4) Web Design, Development and Maintenance Development support will include the design, development, and maintenance of study websites.

It is anticipated that a level of effort of 929,250 hours over a seven-year period will be required to perform the requirement.  

Anticipated Period of Performance: 

The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of options, and award term periods for this proposed acquisition is October 1, 2010 – September 30, 2017.

Capability Statement/Information Sought:

Q & A
This is for those proposing the Overland brand; this RFQ remains Brand Name or Equal.Line Items:Question: 0001     1)  The NEO4100 that is listed is actually End of Life.  Overland Storage has indicated that the correct unit to sell is:  a NEO4100E.  The part # is:  OV-LXN101602.Answer:  The NEO4000 is still available, and they have made some minor improvements on them.  They will continue to give them full support for a minimum of 3 years.
Question: 2)  The LTO-4 Drive has it's own part #.  It's part # is the same as Line 0002.  Would it be okay to change the quantity on Line 0002 to a quantity of 4 vs. 3 or will that be confusing.Answer: In order to not cause any confusion please do not make any changes.
Additional ClarificationThe LTO4 drives come in half-height and full-height, LVD SCSI or fibre channel.  The other Overland libraries like this that NPS has are all configured with full-height LVD SCSI drives, and we use two Fibre Channel Option (FCO) cards.  NPS is aware of the performance difference between the LVD SCSI and the fibre.  However, the NPS has weighed that against the extra cost for the additional fibre ports.
  The NPS has confirmed that all 3 part numbers are all still valid.o OV-LXN101588		NEO4100 w/1 LTO-4 SCSI LVD driveo OV-LXN901085		Add-on LTO-4 SCSI LVD drive (qty 3)o OV-LXN901082		4GB Fiber Channel Option (FCO) (qty 2)

In addition to the Regional Mission in Almaty, Country Offices are located in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and work in close collaboration with the Regional Mission to carry out USAID development priorities.  Within the Regional Mission, the Office of Health and Education (HE) has primary responsibility for the management of assistance in the health and education sectors.  

USAID/CAR’s objective in health care is to assist the public health systems in the Central Asian Republics to better meet the health needs of vulnerable groups.  Activities are focused on four areas:  1) Contributing to safer medical environments; 2) Strengthening public health capacity; 
3) Improving the quality of health services; and 4) Empowering civil society to better respond to health needs.  

B)  Basic Functions of the Position:

The position is located in the Uzbekistan Country Office (UCO) of the USAID/CAR regional mission.  The incumbent is a member of the USAID/CAR/UCO team and USAID/CAR Health and Education Office team.  The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the USAID/CAR/UCO Country Representative or his/her designee.  The incumbent receives supervisory support and technical guidance from the USAID/CAR Health & Education Office Director based in Almaty.  

The incumbent serves as the senior public health advisor on Uzbekistan to the USAID Uzbekistan Country Office Director, USAID Central Asian Republics (CAR) headquarter-based staff, and Embassy Tashkent.  Job holder shares responsibilities with USAID/CAR regional mission for the development and implementation of public health-related program activities and has direct responsibility for day-to-day coordination and monitoring of all USAID health development activities in Uzbekistan, including activities that implement or support the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  

The employee is responsible for overseeing USAID/CAR initiatives in the health sector in Uzbekistan, as assigned. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of health issues in the region, a background in public health programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with government officials, international donors, USAID implementing partners and local non-governmental partners.  Incumbent works closely with the Health & Education Office at USAID/CAR regional headquarters’ office in Kazakhstan to ensure that USAID-funded health development activities carried out in Uzbekistan contribute to measurable results that are in accordance with agency regulations, assistance objectives, international ethical guidelines, and public healthcare standards and best practices.

C)  Major Duties and Responsibilities:

The Public Health Management Specialist’s responsibilities and duties shall include, but are not limited to the following:

1) Job holder is the principal public health technical analyst and advisor to the UCO director and USAID/CAR on health-related programming in Uzbekistan.

In addition to the Regional Mission in Almaty, Country Offices are located in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and work in close collaboration with the Regional Mission to carry out USAID development priorities.  Within the Regional Mission, the Office of Health and Education (HE) has primary responsibility for the management of assistance in the health and education sectors.  

USAID/CAR’s objective in health care is to assist the public health systems in the Central Asian Republics to better meet the health needs of vulnerable groups.  Activities are focused on four areas:  1) Contributing to safer medical environments; 2) Strengthening public health capacity;

The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the USAID/CAR/UCO Country Representative or his/her designee.  The incumbent receives supervisory support and technical guidance from the USAID/CAR Health & Education Office Director based in Almaty.

The employee is responsible for overseeing USAID/CAR initiatives in the health sector in Uzbekistan, as assigned. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of health issues in the region, a background in public health programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with government officials, international donors, USAID implementing partners and local non-governmental partners.  Incumbent works closely with the Health & Education Office at USAID/CAR regional headquarters’ office in Kazakhstan to ensure that USAID-funded health development activities carried out in Uzbekistan contribute to measurable results that are in accordance with agency regulations, assistance objectives, international ethical guidelines, and public healthcare standards and best practices.

The Public Health Management Specialist’s responsibilities and duties shall include, but are not limited to the following:

1) Job holder is the principal public health technical analyst and advisor to the UCO director and USAID/CAR on health-related programming in Uzbekistan.

As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of health issues in the region, a background in public health programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with government officials, international donors, USAID implementing partners and local non-governmental partners.

<CONTACT>John Kusnierek, Phone (703) 875-4357, Email jkusnierek@ustda.gov
<DESC><p>The following questions have been answered by the Grantee and USTDA (question 5).</p>
<p>Q1. The RFP mentions that MXP will be involved in the project by providing support services to the contractor at no cost. What is the nature of those services?</p>
<p>A1. Logistic information i.e. information about best means of local transportation, hotels, and providing meeting rooms for the discussion of the project.</p>
<p>Q2. We foresee the basic data requirements listed below would be best provided by local personnel and would like to know if this information is included as part of the services that MPX will provide at no cost.<br />1 Historical growth of municipality (population and economic growth)<br />2 Historical growth of solid waste generation of municipality<br />3 Expected growth in both aspects<br />4 Historical and expected pricing data of; electrivity, fuel gas, other utilities, manpower, other</p>
<p>A2. No. We understand that it will be in the 20% of subcontractors from the Host Country under specific service</p>
<p>Q3. The RFP mentions that one of the Brazilian companies involved has made available a portion of land of their ownership for construction of the site. Has the site selection essentially been completed? If so, is our job just to verify that the selection is appropriate? If not, what/how many other sites are there to be considered in site selection?</p>
<p>A3. There is a case study, that is Caju Plant in Rio de Janeiro. Comlurb (municipal waste company) will give access to the site and information about characteristic of Rio de Janeiro&acute;s waste. But, initially the feasibility study should consider the possibility of other sites and eventually indicate (in general) a different technology (option) according to the different sites analyzed - Please see Task 1. After then the feasibility study focuses only in the site of Caju Plant (as study case). It is important to get a replicable technology for other similar project / sites in Rio de Janeiro. And in case of any constrain of the Caju Plant to waste to energy project (for example environmental constrain) - it should be indicated.</p>
<p>Q4. In regards to the Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment, could you provide further guidance in terms of the scope and detail of this study Vs a FULL EIA? Should the current sudy employ soil and air samples, for example, or should it take more of a qualititaive approach? A similar situation arises in regards to the legal, reglatory, and institutional review. How detailed should this study be?</p>
<p>A4. The study should consider all relevant (environmental and regulatory) aspect to a possible implementation of the WtE Plant - in other words, see if the project can really be implemented considering all legal and environmental aspects and constrains (and the impacts of air emission and soil contamination should be considered, according to the technology adopted and the environmental legislation). It should be analyzed if the project comply with environmental (national and international - see task 5) and regulatory aspect - and, in case of regulatory aspect, what could be improved or adopted by the municipality to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>Q5. Our firm will subcontract a portion of the work related to this project. Some subcontractors require a guarantee letter that somehow ensures that the work will be paid for if completed satisfactorily, can the USTDA issue something of this sort?</p>
<p>A5. USTDA cannot provide a guarantee.</p>
<p>Q6. As the RFP reads, the only requirement at the end of the project is to present a written Final Report BUT NOT a presentation in-person. Is this right?</p>
<p>A6. Yes. But the report should be clear enough for understanding of MPX. If not, maybe a presentation in person or video- conference will be requested.</p>

This modification is issued to obligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of 2009 funds to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for the purpose of providing $373,200 in operations funding for project # 20685 – EGS R&D (2004190). These funds are to be distributed to Agreement #19978-Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) with CO2 as Heat Transmission Fluid, in accordance with field work proposal #ESD09-006.  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will conduct experiments on fluid flow, heat transfer, and rock-fluid chemical interactions to 1) test theoretical predictions about favorable fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of COS, 2) obtain basic data needed to evaluate the concept, and 3) design a field test.

This contract was awarded competitively.  The contract is cost reimbursement due to the uncertainties of the research and development mission of the laboratory making the reasonable estimate of total costs of performance impossible and therefore not appropriate as a firm, fixed-price type contract.

<DESC>Recovery Action - DUNS 078576738. This modification is issued to obligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of 2009 funds to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for the purpose of providing $150,000.00 in operations funding for project # 20454 - Enhance and Accelerate Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) Service Functions to the Federal Government. These funds are to be distributed to Agreement #19076-LBNL Technical Guidance and Assistance, in accordance with AOP# 2004160. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will provide technical assistance activities to federal agencies in accordance with the identified work authorization as approved by the Federal Energy Management Program. None of the funds provided are approved for any type of support service subcontracting.
<p>This contract was awarded competitively. This is a cost reimbursement contract because the uncertainties of performance of the research mission of the laboratory make it unreasonable to estimate the costs of performance with enough certainty to support a firm, fixed-price contract.</p>

This modification is issued to obligate American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of 2009 funds to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for the purpose of providing $7,384,000.00 in operations funding for the Laboratory to enhance the Phase I Cloud Computing by installing additional storage to support data intensive applications. The cluster will be instrumented to characterize the concurrency, communication patterns, and Input/Output of individual applications. The testbed and workload will be made available to the community for determining the effectiveness of commercial cloud computing models for DOE. The Phase I research will be expanded to address multi-site issues. The Laboratory will be managing the project and will initiate any subcontracting opportunities. Prospective sources are requested to contact the laboratory. Information on how to contact and do business with the laboratory is available at the following URL: http://www.lbl.gov/Workplace/CFO/pro/small-bus/
<p>The contract was awarded competitively. The contract is cost reimbursement because the research mission prevents the reasonable estimation of the costs of performance making a firm, fixed-price contract type inappropriate.</p>

<DESC>Recovery Action: As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office (ORO) has issued a task order against existing Environmental Management (EM) Nationwide Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to perform EM scope on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) site. DOE-ORO requires the services of a contractor to perform removal and disposal activities of approximately 26,000 cubic yards of "hot spot" soil contamination and hydraulically isolate two major sources of contaminant releases in Bethel Valley (i.e., Solid Waste Storage Area [SWSA] 1 and SWSA 3). The scope is based on the selected remedy presented in the Bethel Valley Watershed Interim Record of Decision (ROD).<br />(DUNS # 192272396)
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: To reduce the time it would take to procure the required services DOE ORO awarded this task order under the existing EM Nationwide Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts.-These contracts help to stream line the competitive acquisition process and minimize the time it takes to procure the required services than if they were procured under full and open competition.</p>

<AWARDEE>Native American Services Sorp., 53285 Silver Valley Road, Kellogg, ID 83837 US
<DESC>The work required includes replacing two existing boilers with new water heaters and upgrading air handling equipment to improve the efficiency of heating and air handling systems at the Zuni Indian Hospital. This requirement is for a proposal leading to issuance of a delivery order under a competitively awarded Job Order Contract (JOC) for the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Service. The contractor is Native American Services Corp with a field office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Scope of Work includes (1) installation of two new water heaters to replace existing steam boilers and(2) install variable speed air handler drives at the Zuni Indian Hospital located at Zuni, New Mexico. Existing boilers are over 30 years old and obsolete. Steam for sterilization is no longer needed at the hospital and providing space heating by steam has become an expensive and labor intensive process. The existing air handlers are single speed units with low efficiency. Energy savings can be realized by upgrading the drives and controls. The contractor shall analyze existing systems to select appropriate equipment to provide heating, variable speed motors and controls for adequate heating to all appurtenances. The contractor shall determine if additional components are required for efficient use of exiting piping, coils, etc. and for efficient air distribution. The contractor shall provide electronic system controls and actuators for direct connection to the existing DDC system. The contractor shall also remove and dispose of existing boilers, associated equipment and air distribution equipment as required and provide training to hospital maintenance staff on the proper operation of the installed equipment. The contractor will provide “As-built” drawings of the completed systems in both paper and AutoCadd media. The magnitude of this construction project is between $500,000 and $1 million. This requirement was previously publicized as an informational Presolicitation Notice on August 4, 2009. THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE AWARDED BY ISSUANCE OF A DELIVERY ORDER UNDER EXISTING IDIQ CONTRACT HHSI161200900004I.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL
AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOTFOC)
FOR ACQUISITIONS UNDER $100K

MAJOR OVERHAUL KITS, INFLATABLE SEALS,
FACE CHANGE KITS, AND SEAT ASSEMBLIES


Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: 

(1)	Agency and Contracting Activity: The U.S. Coast Guard, Engineering Logistics Center (ELC) proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

(2)	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Approval is for a firm fixed price contract type required to purchase two (2) each of the following items: Major Overhaul Kit, Seat Assembly, Face Change Kit, and Inflatable Seal. These items will be purchased on a sole source basis from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Wartsila Defense (CAGE OEYA6) (Wartsila). Wartsila manufactures the M-9 seal that these kits and parts support as well as every part and all components of the kits. Wartsila is located at 3617 Koppens Way, Chesapeake, Va. 23323. 

(3)	Description of Supplies/Services: The requirement is to purchase two each of the following items to be used on the USCGC 418 Ft. WMSL Propulsion Shaft Seals: 

NSN NO.			PART NO.		QTY.		UNIT		AMOUNT
									PRICE
2840-01-576-0008	WLP001354-001	    2		
2040-01-575-9949	US75888-01-6		    2		
5180-01-575-9938	WLP001354-002	    2		
5330-01-575-9830	US75888-01-1-10	    2		    
				TOTAL						
See attached for a detailed description of, and specifications for these items. 

(4)	Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304©(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, HSAM 3006.302-1 and CGAP 3006.302-1(a)(2)(ii) since these items are available from only one responsible source or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.  

(5)	 Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: During the initial development and building of the NSC, proprietary data was not required nor purchased for the parts utilized.  The ELC does not possess the necessary drawings and specifications that would enable another vendor to manufacture any of the parts listed.  It is imperative that the parts conform to form, fit and function as to the existing Wartsila Stern Tube seal parts.  Wartsila owns all technical data, including all the proprietary rights to the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture these items.

(6)	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable: Wartsila is the only manufacturer able to supply the required Overhaul Kit, Face Change Kit, Seat Assembly and Inflatable Seal to meet the Shaft Seal specifications. A Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement to Wartsila will be posted on FBO to inform suppliers of the U.S. Coast Guard decision. This announcement will inform industry that it is the government intent to award a sole source contract to Wartsila since they are the only one responsible source and no other supplies or parts will satisfy these requirements. The notice will also state that the drawings, data and special tooling necessary for full and open competition are proprietary and available only from the manufacturer. The performance and acceptance data are also proprietary. However, all offers will be considered.  

(7)	Determination by the Contracting Office that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: Price will be determined to be fair and reasonable based on prior acquisition history with other contractors providing similar items and comparison with other published price lists if available. 

(8)	Description of Market Research: Market research was conducted using NESSS, FEDLOG, GSA Advantage, WEBFLIS and the World Wide Web. Similar items were found in NESSS for the face change kit and the major overhaul kit, however the items were for a much smaller boat and shaft and therefore less expensive. After researching all of these sites, it was determined that the NSC WMSL Overhaul Kit, Face Change Kit, Seat Assembly and Inflatable Seal are uniquely designed and manufactured by Wartsila. The Overhaul Kit, Face Change Kit, Seat Assembly and Inflatable Seal will be used to renew the worn components of the shaft seal.

(9)	Any other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The U.S. Coast Guard does not possess the necessary drawings, configurations and specifications that would enable another vendor to manufacture the Stern Tube Seal parts.  It is imperative that the Parts conform to form, fit and function as the existing Stern Tube Seal Parts.  Using other than OEM parts could cause failure of the shaft seal, which would allow seawater to enter the engineering room at a fast rate, presenting a very real possibility of the ship sinking, further endangering the crew.  The crew would have to use the emergency shaft seal, which would render the propulsion shaft unusable. The inability to use one or both of the ships propeller shafts in this manner would eliminate or greatly reduce the ability of the ship to meet mission requirements. 

(10)	A Listing of the Sources, if Any, which Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: In accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, in an effort to solicit as many potential sources as possible, a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement will be posted on FedBizOpps advising industry of the Government’s intention to award a fixed price contract to Wartsila unless other sources could provide verification of their capabilities to satisfy this requirement. 

(11)	A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition before any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: The U.S. Coast Guard could not purchase the rights to the technical data, drawings and specifications from the OEM, necessary for conducting a full and open competition. The manufacturing data rights, drawings, and special tooling necessary for full and open competition are proprietary and available only from the Wartsila. The Contracting Officer requested that Wartsila provides their position relative on providing unrestricted data rights to facilitate obtaining full and open competition on all future acquisitions. Wartsila is not interested in selling the data rights for the manufacturing of these parts. The U.S. Coast Guard will continue to perform market research to determine if other manufacturer(s) emerges with the capabilities to produce these kits and parts.

The VAMC, Walla Walla, WA, competed and placed an order for a patient safe lifting system for 2 rooms with slings and accessories and two mobile patient lifts.  The requirement includes installation and training.

money on administrative support and training. These costs have the potential to become
extensive considering different training classes that may have to be taken, learning curve

support from other systems. Findings from market research show that there are multiple
vendors providing these products. thereby ensuring open and fair competition.
VI. EFFORTS TO ADD ADDITIONAL SOURCESISOLICIT FROM AS MANY
SOURCES AS POSSIBLE:
In an effort to overcome such a barrier to competition in the future. the market will be scanned
frequentlj for new hardware that can fuIfill the government's requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 6.8.3.1 Maintenace Planning and Design  Interface Support, China Lake, CA plans to increase the level of effort under the current contract, N68936-01-D-0005 with Synectic Solutions Inc. This notice is for informational purposes only.  Synectic Solutions Inc. will continue to provide technical/management logistics support . They will continue to provide reliability and maintainability analysis, maintenance planning and design interface support requires  evaluation of designs, evaluating design changes, and maintenance planning. The purpose of this increase in the level of effort under the current contract is to provide the capacity needed to maintain current contract initiatives. Provide flexibility for anticipated additional support requirements and provide sufficient additional capacity to allow the continuation of services through the end of the originally intended period of performance.  The increase in the level of effort will sustain efforts through the current period of performance ending 26 April 2011.  The Government’s minimum need for the continuation of effort can only be accomplished reasonably and without inpairing continued support through the award of this level of effort increase.  Only Synectic Solutions Inc has the technical documentation and key personnel necessary to continue the support services currently being performed. It is not possible for any other potential source to become familiar enough with the tasking to sustain this workload without a break in services.  Failures to award this contract will seriously restrict the 6.8.3.1 ability to respond to our sponsors’ needs during the recompetition. These are continuing tasks and are time sensitive.  There are no other sources capable of providing uninterrupted support. The point of contact for this procurement is Ms.  Dawn Churchill, Contract Specialist, E-mail: dawn.churchill@navy.mil, Code: AIR-2.5.1.6.1.2

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<ARCHDATE>09252009
<DESC>Brand Name Justification
Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.
To the best knowledge of the VA, Dell is the sole authorized manufacturer for these services. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00pm cst on September 24, 2009. Additional manufactures that can provide the service will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the firm has been granted rights to provide the services being procured. The determination to open competition based on responses is solely with in the discretion of the Government. If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published. Responses should be emailed to kari.cozzens@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.
1.  Contracting Activity
     Department of Veterans Affairs     Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management     Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin     1615 Woodward Austin, TX 78772
2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a Purchase Order (PO) for maintenance of Dell Hardware Maintenance.  
3.	Description of Service and Supplies:  Dell hardware maintenance for the period 10/01/2009 - 09/30/2010 for the Corporate Data Center Operations (CDCO) Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  The attached list identifies the specific hardware maintenance requirements.
4.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 11.105(1) the particular brand name, product or feature is essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's requirement because, substantial duplication of cost to the Government would occur that cannot be recovered through competition.  
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  
The CDCO AITC currently owns all hardware identified in the attached list.  No other manufactures can provide maintenance services for these licenses.  Dell is the only manufacture since they own all software code, proprietary license rights used for patches, fixes, telephone support, online support, upgrades, and new releases, and hardware proprietary rightes.  The requirement can be competed among authorized resellers as a pass through service.  Competing the requirement other than brand name would not meet the Government's needs could cause additional cost to the Government in the area of re-procurement of software, downtime for maintenance services, and training for VA subject matter experts required to use the software.  This duplication of cost could not be recovered through competition of the maintenance services with other manufacturers.
6.  Description of Market Research:  Internet searches, research on GSA schedules, and discussions held with commercial companies and subject matter experts were held.  Research indicated that no other products in the market place can be identified to meet the Governments requirements identified above.  
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  Award will be issued as firm fixed priced off of the previously negotiated NASA SEWP IV contract.  Price competition is expected from authorized resellers.
8.  Other Supporting Data:  N/A
9.  Other Interested Sources:  None
10.	Future barriers to competition:  VA has to solicit for only the specific brand names/models already in place on the CDCO AITC network infrastructure at this time.  Future requirements developed as a result of new software procurement intend to remove barriers to competition by ensuring VA has data rights in order to maintain software internally or receive maintenance externally with knowledge of functional requirements.
