<RESPDATE>062909
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick K Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Agilent Technologies, Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware for the purchase of a Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS) Instrument under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 b(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
 
The Organic Chemical Metrology Group of NIST’s Analytical Chemistry Division is responsible for chemical measurements leading to the certification of a large number of Standard Reference Materials (SRMs).  Liquid chromatography with mass selective detection (LC/MS) is now used extensively by the group for chemical measurements.  

NIST currently utilizes four LC/MS instruments from Agilent Technologies (property numbers 584596, 620103, 618763, and 623796) for a wide variety of chemical analyses.  Because these instruments have the same technical performance and utilize the same data acquisition and processing software, measurements performed on one instrument are directly comparable to measurements on the other.  

NIST is seeking to augment its current measurement capabilities by purchasing additional instrumentation that is identical to, and interchangeable with, its existing instrumentation.  NIST’s current sample load is rapidly exceeding the capabilities of its existing instrument resources.  As NIST adds instrumentation, it is essential that continuity is maintained in instrument performance and data handling, and this can only be achieved by purchasing instrumentation with identical performance characteristics as the existing instrumentation.  This ensures compatibility of results if samples are analyzed on different instruments at different points in time as part of an SRM certification, or if samples must be reanalyzed at a later date to check material stability.

It is imperative that NIST have the ability to analyze and reanalyze samples at any time, on any LC/MS in the Organic Chemical Metrology lab, with no variation in results of the LC/MS instrument readings.  This can only be accomplished by using a bank of machines with identical performance characteristics.

Key required specifications are as follows:

1.	Integrated LC/MS system with all instrument parameters and modules controlled by a single data and acquisition package.

2.	Binary LC pump capable of producing binary gradients.

3.	Micro vacuum degasser

4.	Thermostatted well-plate autosampler

5.	Thermostatted column compartment with Peltier heating and cooling

6.	UV detector

7.	Single quadrupole mass analyzer with mass range of at least 50-3000 m/z

8.	Electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source, as well as an atmospheric pressure photionization (APPI) source

9.	ChemStation data acquisition and processing software  

Agilent Technologies, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide a Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS) Instrument that meets NIST’s requirements.  Therefore, Agilent Technologies, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS) Instrument.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on June 29, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Questions and Answers

1. In sections 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, the following terms are mentioned: work product, equipment, and accountable property. Are they all the same thing? If not, what are the differences among them?  Equipment and accountable property both refer to physical equipment we need to track.  Work product refers to tasks or projects that involve TSB personnel and/or equipment.

2. What is the meaning of "current antenna site lease information"? (Section 1.0) We currently lease multiple antenna sites for our mobile radio system.  We need to track data about these sites such as site owner, address, elevation, lat./long., site equipment, etc…

3. Section 2.0 mentions this task: Share database information with other similar applications. We are unable to find its specifics in the rest of this RFQ. Can USMS explain the scenario/manner in which data will be shared with other similar applications? Can USMS provide a list of these "other similar applications"? Section 3.0 explains in details each task outlined in Section 2.0 except this task of "Share database information with other similar applications". Can we know why?  We have additional Access db’s and excel spreadsheets that we would like to be able to share data with.  The application needs the ability to import and export data files (.txt, .csv, etc…)

4.  Section of Submission of Quote: Does a vendor have to provide two paper copies of quote by regular mail? According to this same section, it seems delivery can be made either via email or regular mail. Please clarify.  Delivery can be made by mail or email

5. If paper copies of quote are required, can a vendor deliver it to the following address in person? No hand delivered copies will not be accepted.  If yes, then any procedure is needed for delivery at the site?

6.   Related to Task 3.1.4; what are the specs of the Dell 2950 servers?  Intel Xeon Processor (CPU) E5450 3.00GH.  Minimum of 16Gig RAM. Intel Integrated Video Card.  Six 750Gig SATA HD, 10k or 15K or 7200 RPM.

7.  Related to Task 3.1.6; is there currently a barcode scan solution in place?  If so what product/system is used, how is it used, where is it used, etc?  There is not currently a bar code scanning function in place.  The application simply needs to have the scalability to include this feature.  The USMS will procure any additional hardware or proprietary software separately to implement a bar code reader utility.

8.  Related to Task 3.1.7; what is your definition of “scalable”? We want to be able to add RFID functionality at some point in the future without having to fundamentally re-design the application.

9.  Related to Task 3.2.1; what server will be used to host the application? Is this server a Windows server or other?  Does this server utilize IIS or Apache?  Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise x32 Edition (Possibility of upgrading to Windows Server 2008 Enterprise 32bit).  It will have IIS version 6 or 7. 

10.  Related to Task 3.2.6; what are the USMS configuration standards and DOJ computer security policies/configurations? Servers and desktops are managed via Group Policy.  Desktops do have a few configurations that are implemented in local policy of the machine which is in the image. 

11.  Related to Task 3.3; do you currently use Crystal Reports?  If so how is it being used?  Are users currently trained on Crystal Reports to create Ad Hoc queries and run pre determined queries?  Our unit is not currently using Crystal Reports.  Vendor will not be responsible for user training on Crystal Reports.  Application shall be compatible with Crystal Reports 2008.

12. What is the current system used for mission tracking and inventory control?  Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

13. In section 2.0 Scope, 2.5 states “Share database information with other similar applications.”  Is CSV format acceptable for this or do we need to create SQL queries? CSV format is acceptable.

14. In section 3.0 Tasks, 3.2.1 states “the front end shall be http based to be launched from the USMS TSB intranet site.  What is the web server it is running and the IIS version? It can be HTTPS as well and the IIS will be either 6 or 7.  Database should be compatible with 6 and 7.

 
15.  Section 3.2.5 states speaks on configuration standards.  It says that “technical information and collaboration will be provided to ensure the vendor has the required information to accomplish this.”  Is their any information you can provide on this at this time? Please specify the browser and version if able. We will be providing any additional technical information if needed.  We would like to make sure the Database can be accessed via web interface using IE6, IE7, IE8 and Mozilla Firefox 3.xx.


16. In the section titled SUBMISSION OF QUOTE, subparagraph e reads as follows: 
“e) The Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price may be emailed to: Valerie.Snowden2@usdoj.gov or mailed to the following address:” 
Does this mean that the proposal may be emailed and not provided in hard copy?   Quote can be either emailed or hard copy mailed.  The mailing address is provided in solicitation.

17. Is there a specific format required for the price proposal? There is no specific format for price.  Format for the submission of the quote is in the solicitation under Addendum to FAR 52.212-1

18. How will the design specifications be provided and who will be responsible for providing this information?  The selected vendor will provide analysis and design documentation based on requirements determined by the USMS and the vendor.
 
19. What is the present condition of the data to be imported into the new application? Understanding that the data presently exists in Excel spreadsheets and an Access data base, has the data integrity been verified? The current data will be sorted into the table format of the final delivered database and then imported.  The data accuracy and integrity will be the responsibility of the USMS.

20. Can you elaborate on the user acceptance testing process that will be required? Who is responsible for the test plan? Vendor is responsible for developing the test plan.

21. In section 3.2.7, it is stated that “The vendor will provide all necessary technical assistance required to implement the front end of the database in the USMS/DOJ WAN environment”. 
Can you elaborate on the processes and requirements for the vendor to perform in order to promote the application into the production environment? The answer to this question is as same as Section 3.2.5. If they have further question while developing the database we can help answering any question related to our network and configuration.  We want to make sure the database should be web application based.  IT should be accessed via any web browser.

22. Section 2.1 reads “Create a relational database to track TSB work products and accountable property.”- 
Is an audit capability required for the database in terms of what changes were made, by whom and when? 
What is the security scheme for access control that is required? 
Will there be USM participation (will SMEs be available to participate ) in a short discovery and business requirements solidification session with prototyping? Yes, USMS SMEs will be available throughout the project as needed.

23. Section 2.2 reads “Create an HTTP based front-end for the database or other suitable front end application”- 
Do you have a wireframe prototype, functional spec or Access data base that is being used today and can we have access to the same? This will be used for estimation purposes.  The USMS has an existing Access database.  Unfortunately examples could not be posted graphically.  The database forms include up to approximately 30 fields.  The database or field values will be defined and provided to the vendor.

24. Section 2.3 reads “Deliver a reporting capability compatible with Crystal Reports.”- 
What is the approximate number of reports envisaged? See Task 3.3 Can we have a list of the reports needed?  The USMS has a requirement to create reports based on time, quantities, person tasked assigned to etc… in the database.  The application will ne to be able to be queried by field or multiple fields by the user. For example how many radios, model number X did deputy Smith deploy during X time period.

25. Section 2.4 reads “Import existing data into the database.” 
Where is the existing data located and can we have a description of the sources/data and layouts? See Task 3.4
We were unable to post the examples.  The data is currently in Excel format,  It resides on the USMS network and can be duplicated as needed.  The format is who what where when and Item type, value, acquisition date, location etc..

26. Section 2.5 reads “Share database information with other similar applications” 
What are these applications and can we have a list/description of the similar applications? We have additional Access db’s and excel spreadsheets that we would like to be able to share data with.  The application needs the ability to import and export data files (.txt, .csv, etc…)

27. Section 2.6 reads “Create a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.” 
What is the scope expected for the disaster recovery plan and what are the recovery objectives? The USMS would like to have a structured backup and recovery integrated into the application or running in parallel.  This could be network mirror/synchronization, tape backup etc…  If we lose server or database we need to be able to recover quickly and completely.

28. Section 2.7 reads “Application support and maintenance”. 
Can you provide an overview of the SLAs expected for application maintenance and any other information that is relevant to this RFP?  Maintenance would include patches for any problems in the application, software updates as required to core applications and ensue compatibility, minor application changes (add a fileld).  

29. We are classified as a Small Business and have a GSA contract, are there any restrictions on teaming with another firm where we would be the prime.  There are no restrictions on teaming.

30.  Task 3.3 Deliver a reporting capability compatible with Crystal Reports.
QUESTION:
What version of Crystal Reports does the USMS use? Application shall be compatible with Crystal Reports 2008.
31.  Period of Performance is from 6 weeks - 12 weeks for full implementation.  Warranty support is negotiated if support & maintenance package for 1 year is purchased.  Does this mean the contract POP is for maximum of 12 weeks?  We would like the application to be fully implemented and tested within 12 weeks of contract award.  If the project timeline is proven to be unreasonable the USMS is willing to discuss further.

32.  For the Cost Proposal, is the Government asking for a quote for the 12 weeks implementation and a separate quote for 1 year optional maintenance?  The initial quote should include one year of maintenance beginning at the delivery time of the application.  Additional years should be priced and optional.

33. Is the period of performance inclusive of the time required to gather and define the requirments to create the database and develop the front end application and crystal report report interfaces or development only? We would like the application to be fully implemented and tested within 12 weeks of contract award.
 
34.  Are System Interface Agreement in place for data sharing with other similiar application owners?  Any such agreements are in place or will be put in place by the USMS.  Such agreements are the responsibility of the USMS.  All current data is USMS owned and in an Excel exported format. 
 
35.  Is there existing requirements for the front end application  and crystal report design?  If not, who will be providing the requirements for the front end application and crystal report interface developments?  Design will be a collaborative effort between the USMS and the selected vendor.  Requirements documentation will be the responsibility of the selected vendor.
 
36.  Will the Government provide Government Furnished hardware, software, and licenses for development and testing?  This is negotiable and may be a factor in vendor selection.  The USMS would prefer not to provide these resources.  The final product should be an installable application from digital media on any hardware software configuration deemed compatible by the vendor.
 
37.  What is the contract type (T&M, FFP, etc)?  Firm Fixed Price

38.  What is the minimum personnel security requirements for this task (U.S Citizen, Perm. Resident, clearance required, etc)?  Legal resident and lawful business.  The USMS will require personal information of anyone working on or with access to the application.  A clearance is not required but a cursory security background check will be performed1. In sections 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, the following terms are mentioned: work product, equipment, and accountable property. Are they all the same thing? If not, what are the differences among them?  Equipment and accountable property both refer to physical equipment we need to track.  Work product refers to tasks or projects that involve TSB personnel and/or equipment.

39.  Can the Government provide the IGCE (Independent Government Cost Estimate) value for this task?  The IGCE will not be provided.

40.  Is all the development work to be done in your Springfield, VA location? All development tasks will be performed at the contractor’s site.  Implementation and testing will be performed at the USMS TSB location in Springfield, VA.

41. What are your security clearance requirements? No security clearance is required.  However personal information and a cursory criminal history and background check will be performed on the selected vendor.

42. What are the locations of the field offices this will be utilized in? Is any travel involved or is the solution completely distributed and or accessed remotely from your Springfield location? Travel to field offices will not be required.

43. Are alternative technologies for your environment a consideration, ie grid architectures, transparent failover support, etc.? It is possible.

44. What is the location of the DR system? Is the DR system to provide "hot swapable" capability for continuous operational support?  GOV location to be determined by USMS and vendor.  Hot swap drives are an option.

45. The current assumption is that this data management system is to provide 24X7 access. Is this a correct assumption? Yes.

46. Is there a preference for storage. For instance, is it the Marshall Service's preference to have fully mirrored disk capability via a SAN. Or is DAS or NAS storage adequate for your current mission?  We have fully mirrored disk and NAS.  The server itself (Dell 2950) has about 2TB space and we can provide more space if needed.  We plan to get a SAN in place.


47.  In section 2.0, the tasks listed appear to have a corresponding task and deliverable listed in section 3 and 5 respectively. However, paragraph 2.5 indicates that software development and engineering support be provided to “Share database information with other similar applications” and has no corresponding task in section 3 or deliverable in section 5.  Please advise if there are any specifications and deliverables associated with this task. We have additional Access db’s and excel spreadsheets that we would like to be able to share data with.  The application needs the ability to import and export data files (.txt, .csv, etc…)

48.  Paragraph 3.6: Please clarify if the “application support and maintenance” required is for break/fix support and tech support via email or telephone; or if the USMS requires support to expand and enhance the capability of the Mission Tracking and Inventory Control Database initially delivered and implemented.  Patches, updated core application compatibility and minor enhancements adding a field etc.. 

49.  The term “Warranty Period” is used in both paragraphs 3.6 and 4.0. Is it correct to assume that the terms and conditions of the support and maintenance described in the contractor’s response to paragraph 3.6 define what is to be delivered to USMS under the option period? yes

50.  Paragraph 3.6: Please indicate any specific SLA provisions required by USMS. 
We would like to have a 4hr response to database malfunction or problem and a 24/7 technical support.  We would like to avoid a callback type of support.  A callback type support is when a call is placed for technical support and the vendor will give a time frame in which an engineer will call back.  This would be for the software application provided and its operation with other core applications.  This would not cover hardware or network failures of course.  We would also like a live tech support and a thorough troubleshooting documentation in case of database failure.


Basically, we would like to see a knowledge base documentation that indicates all errors or failures that may happen during backing up or restoring the database.

 
51.  Paragraph 3.2.8: Please clarify if the USMS intends to “make modifications independent of the original developer” if the Application Support and Maintenance option is exercised. If the maintenance is excersised the USMS would most likely utilize the agreement to make any changes.

52.  Paragraph 3.3: Indicates that the USMS is to design 10 pre-defined reports once the table structure is completed. Does the USMS have any milestones dates for completing the report design once table structure is completed? Not at this time.

53.  Please advise if the existing data currently maintained MS Excel and Access described in paragraph 3.4 contains all the essential data elements needed to track, maintain an report the objectives of paragraph 1.0?  Essential data elements have been identified.  

54.  Please describe the items that will be inventoried. (Trucks, guns, land, radios, etc) Equipment including radios, antennas, vehicles, firearms, computers, phones, etc…
                                                                   
55. Can the items being inventoried be broken down and need to be track once broken down by sub unit. e.g. A palette of MRE's can be broken into cases and further broken into meals and tracked.  There are some instances of this.  For example deployable video unit may have a computer, Ethernet switch and hard drive but be inventoried ans Viedo Unit #1.  The items could be traked by the unit or individually.  The majority of items tracked are accountable property with a value of over $1,000.  We do not track MRE’s, nuts and bolts etc…
                                                                   
56. Does the inventory application need to support "kitting".   The item is a truck, but all of the items in the truck are tracked as one inventory item. yes
                                                                    
57. Are any of the items in the inventory "aggregate" items?  E.g. Fuel tanks and the fuel in them.  Yes, Kits.   
                                                          
58. What are the expectations of user roles being able to see inventory across sites that they might not work at or service?  The database will be networked and shared based on user permissions across the U.S.
                                                                   
59. Is there a higher level management structure where a role would be able to see inventory in all sites as a manager? Yes, this would be the Administrator or Property Custodian.                                                               

60. In the objectives there is a reference to current antenna site lease information.   We are assuming that these are two-way radio communication sites.  Please list all data elements required for these sites or provide further explanation of the intent of the system to control these sites. We need to track descriptive data about these sites such as site owner, address, elevation, lat./long., site equipment, narrative etc…                                                                                        
61. Please provide the properties that would need to be tracked for personnel assigned to TOG/TSB tasks. NAME, badge number, phone numbers, address, etc.. 

62. Please provide the properties that would need to be tracked for equipment assigned to TOB/TSB tasks. Miscellaneous equipment including radios, computers, camera, antennas, firearms,, etc…                                                       
                                                      

63. 3.4 describes data in Excel and Access in a limited fashion.   Can we have a sample of any of the data from both systems? Unable to post but is basically item descriptors and who did what where with what.  The USMS needs to account for what it did where by whom with what resources were utilized.                                                       

64. There is information provided about tracking the assets. However, not a lot of detail is given about the context of the mission and data required to track it. Can this be elaborated upon more than has been given?  EX:  Personnel deploy to Hurricane Katrina with special vehicle and equipment.  We need to track who went with what equipment and what was done when.   
                   
65. Explain the context of your project codes and how/who creates, controls, and assigns the codes in the system. These are basically account numbers for different units of the USMS.  Property on code 1234 belongs to TOG.  1235 belongs to Prisoner transport etc..  It is simply a numerical field and internal identifier.
                                                                   
66. Can users at various levels create their own codes?  No, this is done by HQ.                                                          

67. In 3.1 "work products" are described as being tracked by this system.   Are those "work products" the mission taskings? Yes, work product refers to tasks or projects that involve TSB personnel and/or equipment.
