In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC; 562 State Road DD, Auxvasse, MO 65231-1012; for the performance of a research and development (R&amp;D) project in support of the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The estimated period of performance of the project is 36 months.
<p>The research project will be for an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract to provide the delivery of up to 125 healthy male Yucatan swine with weights ranging from 20-80kg. The swine will be healthy, disease free, swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) tested and shipped within 1 mismatch, at the required weight in 100% of the ordered quantity for each delivery, or the shipment shall be replaced. The animal facility requires the vendor to have a United States Department of Agriculture approved Class A animal breeder license. The requirement supports research focuses on the protection, resuscitation and stabilization of combat casualties at Echelon 1 and 2 points of care in the combat theater.</p>
<p>Healthy male Yucatan swine are required for critical on-going NAMRU-SA future scientific research efforts to have healthy, disease free animals from one vendor; this will ensure the scientific data generated is consistent, which is critical when testing different vendor devices under that same research environment. Due to the early involvement of Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC providing healthy male Yucatan in previous ongoing research efforts, they must continue to provide this supply until commencement to avoid the injection of inconsistency in study results. In addition, it is imperative that new data is being created, collected and reviewed under the same controls as previous data collection to ensure consistent analysis is being performed. This is critical to the integrity of the entire study and can only be accomplished through the use of the same supplier. In addition, Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC has an established history of delivering 100% healthy lots. Loss of one or two animals due to diseases will cause a major disruption on data collection and data analysis.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to continue previously supported advanced development of a cell-based wound therapy for treatment of eye trauma resulting from combat injuries. Cell-based therapies derived from a natural cell secretome show promise for addressing these complicated injuries given the presence of naturally occurring transmembrane and secreted proteins that play important roles in cell migration, signaling, and communication. Treating combat injuries with this type of therapy may lead to faster, more effective wound healing, enabling the warfighter to return to the battlefield. The goal of this program is to develop and attain FDA approval of a cell-based wound therapeutic that uses amnion-derived stem cell secretome for treatment and improved healing of eye trauma wounds.<br /><br />NMRC-AMD has funded related contracts in prior years, for similar projects. The first sponsored project, using the same biological products, investigated treatment of blast injuries and burn wounds. Additional projects investigated periodontitis and traumatic brain injury indications. Collecting and assessing data from previous studies provided essential knowledge and early clinical results demonstrating the potential of use of amnion-derived stem cells to improve healing for eye trauma resulting from combat injury. that can conduct research that utilizes Amnion-derived Multi-potent Progenitor (AMP) cells and their secreted cytokine solution ST266 (also known as Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution (ACCS)) to decrease loss of tissue, obtain more rapid wound healing, and decrease scarring for eye injuries. It is expected that the benefits of therapies developed to care for wounded service men and women will immediately be applicable to civilian patients and that successful development and deployment of this therapy may lead to other applications across a broad spectrum of needs that range from burn victims to adults afflicted with the slow-healing wounds typical of Type II diabetes.<br /><br />The proposed contract builds upon Noveome's (formerly Stemnion, Inc.) successful completion of pre-clinical animal trials and Phases 1 and 2 human clinical studies. Noveome has completed eight clinical trials in three indications including two in ocular diseases, two in oral health, and four in dermal diseases. To date, 233 subjects have been exposed to the platform technology drug, ST266. ST266 has been shown to be safe when applied topically to skin, the eye, and the oral cavity and the FDA has given approval to proceed. <br /><br />The proposed contract efforts include:<br />&bull; Manufacturing activities, including production of materials for clinical trials and preparation of facilities for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production<br />&bull; Phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of inflammation and pain post cataract surgery, analogous to the military-specific application for treating eye trauma<br />&bull; Regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and quality control activities</p>
<p>The period of performance for the proposed contract is anticipated to be 14-months from 01&nbsp;Jun 2018 - 31 May 2019. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 17:00 PM Eastern Time, 04 May 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following addresses:<br />jennifer.m.reed20.civ@mail.mil and thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil.</p>
