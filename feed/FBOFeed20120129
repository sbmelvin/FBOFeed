<DESC>Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program - Pre-solicitation Conference for the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) and the General Purpose Decontaminant(s) (GPD).<br><br>The Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program will host a Pre-Solicitation Conference to inform and solicit input from industry regarding draft Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) and the General Purpose Decontaminant(s) (GPD). This Pre-Solicitation conference will be conducted from 0900 - 1630 on 16 November 2011 in Fredericksburg, Virginia at the Riverside Center Conference Facility. Interested companies must pre-register no later than close of business 9 November 2011.  Request for attendance should be sent via e-mail to Ms. Erica Howell at erica.howell@usmc.mil and Ms. Stacey Shepherd at stacey.shepherd@usmc.mil.  Due to conference facility size, attendance is limited. Your request should include the company name, contact person, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and the names of the representatives planning to attend. Attendance is not mandatory and will not affect your eligibility to submit an RFP(s) offer. Questions received in response to this announcement will be discussed during the Q&A portion at the pre-solicitation conference.<br><br>Following the Pre-solicitation Conference, an opportunity will be afforded to attendees for 20 minute one-on-one discussions with the DFoS Program Manager.  The discussions will be held on 17 November from 0800-1200 at the JPM P location (50 Tech Parkway, Stafford, VA 22556).   A sign-up sheet for one-on-one discussions will be available at the pre-solicitation conference.  All attendees from outside the United States must also fill out a Foreign Visitor Tracking Record in order to attend one-on-one discussions.  The Foreign Visitor Tracking Record must be e-mailed to Ms. Howell and Ms. Shepherd at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1 November 2011.<br><br>Detailed information regarding the pre-solicitation conference, including agenda, directions, conference facility and accommodations, and the Foreign Visitor Tracking Record can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/dfos.html <br><br>Draft RFPs: <br>Draft Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for the JSEW and GPD programs will be posted on/about Friday 21 October 2011 at the following links:<br><br>https://www3.natick.army.mil/dfos.html<br>www.fbo.gov  <br><br>for solicitations W911QY-12-R-0006 and W911QY-12-R-0007.<br><br>Questions and comments regarding the draft RFPs shall be sent via e-mail to the above e-mail addresses and submitted not later than 9 November, 2011. Questions received in response to the draft RFPs will be discussed during the Q&A portion at the pre-solicitation conference.<br><br><br>Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW):<br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a JSEW that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment, such as weapon system optics and electronic equipment, in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination.  The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination, supporting thorough decontamination of sensitive equipment without adversely impacting the operational life or performance of the target assets. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the JSEW by basing the design on the maturation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products is central to the acquisition strategy.  An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, is intended to provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the JSEW into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS). The JSEW is considered to be a stand-alone capability.<br><br>Proposed products will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or stimulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and Blister-H. <br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with sensitive equipment, as defined in the JSEW Performance Specifications.  <br><br><br>General Purpose Decontaminant(s) (GPD):<br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a GPD that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons, in hostile and non-hostile environments, that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination thereby reducing health risk to friendly forces and non-combatants from CBRN contaminated assets.  In addition, it is desired that GPD also provide an immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, will provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the GPD into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  The GPD is considered to be a stand-alone capability.   <br><br>Proposed decontaminants will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and/or Blister-H; and/or biological efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) against bacterial endospores, vegetative bacteria, and viruses.<br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with equipment, as defined in the GPD Performance Specification.  <br><br>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  No solicitation exists at this time.

This is not a solicitation and no proposals are requested at this time.<br><br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a GPD that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personal weapons, in hostile and non-hostile environments, that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination thereby reducing health risk to friendly forces and non-combatants from CBRN contaminated assets. In addition, it is desired that GPD also provide an immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical contamination. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, will provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the GPD into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS). The GPD is considered to be a stand-alone capability. <br><br>Proposed decontaminants will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and/or Blister-H; and/or biological efficacy test data (live agent or simulant) against bacterial endospores, vegetative bacteria, and viruses.<br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with equipment, as defined in the GPD Performance Specification. <br><br>The draft RFP and associated attachments can be accessed from the solicitation link on this page or can be downloaded from the Natick Contracting Division website link below. This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.<br><br>The announcement number W911QY-12-R-0007 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this Draft RFP. <br><br>The Government has announced a pre-solicitation conference for interested parties on 16 November 2011.  Questions received at least three (3) business days prior to the pre-solicitation conference will be addressed during the conference.  The full announcement for the pre-proposal conference and registration information is available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-12-R-0007.<br><br>Questions regarding this Draft RFP will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.greenwood@us.army.mil with a courtesy to peter.wallace@us.army.mil. <br><br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby notifies industry at large and parties interested in the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD) W911QY-12-R-0007 of a change in contracting strategy for this program. The forthcoming solicitation for this item shall be in the form of a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation RFP IAW FAR 12.603. This change is in response to industry concerns regarding the complexity of the draft RFP, which is hereby withdrawn.   W911QY-12-R-0007 will continue to be the controlling document number for a General Purpose Decontaminant for Hardened Military Equipment (GPD-HME).   A separate Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, under the controlling document number W911QY-12-R-0034, for a General Purpose Decontaminant for Aircraft Exterior (GPD-AE) will be issued.  Any further information/documentation concerning GPD acquisition shall be issued under W911QY-12-R-0007 and W911QY-12-R-0034 on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) and the Natick Contracting Division website (http://www3.natick.army.mil). This is an announcement of a change in acquisition strategy only and no proposals are requested at this time. <br><br>The Government's revised contracting strategy for GPD is to issue a series of Orders for Commercial Items (Standard Form1449) using simplified acquisition procedures.  Multiple awards are anticipated. These Orders for Commercial Items will be for similar quantities and sequence to those outlined in the GPD test program schedule presented during the GPD Industry Day, beginning with a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation to procure 50 gallons* of GPD-HME and 20 gallons* of GPD-AE from multiple vendors for the first Competitive Prototype testing phase (CP I) of this program. (*Please note: The units of measure assume a ready-to-use product and a single surface application. Additional details on procurement quantities shall be provided in each respective solicitation. Offerors will be expected to make adjustments as necessary depending on the vendor's respective decontaminant configuration.)  <br>The intent of the two separate GPD solicitations is to acquire and test commercial products against specific evaluation criteria with the ultimate intent to procure and field: <br><br>1)	A thorough decontamination capability for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons and individual weapons exposed to chemical and/or biological agents/contamination (GPD-HME), [Solicitation W911QY-12-R-0007] and <br><br>2)	An immediate/operational decontamination capability for aircraft exterior against chemical agents/contamination (GPD-AE), [Solicitation W911QY-12-R-0034]. <br><br>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.  The announcement number W911QY-12-R-0007 for GPD-HME and W911QY-12-R-0034 for GDP-AE will be the controlling documents and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this announcement or any Draft RFP. <br><br>Questions regarding this announcement will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.greenwood@us.army.mil with a courtesy to peter.wallace@us.army.mil and shall be posted in a non-attribution basis to the Federal Business Opportunities and Natick Contracting Division websites.<br>
