<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Blvd. EPS Room 6074, Rockville, MD, 20852, UNITED STATES<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division for Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. Preetha Rajaraman of Rajaraman Consulting, 4938 Hampden Lane, No. 186, Bethesda, MD 20814 for epidemiology support for studies of the etiology of brain tumors and U.S. radiation technologists.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award with one twelve month option period.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) carries out cutting-edge, high-impact research designed to identify, understand, and quantify the risk of cancer in populations exposed to different types of radiation. Within REB's broad research program, areas of specific research focus include: etiology of highly radiosensitive malignancies, including brain/CNS tumors, and cancer risks associated with lower dose radiation exposure from occupational sources, including workers exposed to medical radiation.<br /><br />In early 2009, REB launched a large, international cohort-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) of glioma using samples of DNA from individual subjects enrolled in 22 major international epidemiologic studies. The REB has also been carrying out a cohort investigation of cancer risks in U.S. radiologic technologists. The U.S. Radiologic Study (USRT) cohort includes 146, 022 radiologic technologists residing in the United States and certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) for at least 2 years between 1926 and 1982. Cancer mortality risks have been studied in relation to occupational radiation exposures in the entire cohort, and cancer incidence risks have been evaluated in more than 110,000 technologists who completed at least one of three comprehensive questionnaire surveys administered over the last 20 years. In addition to detailed work history information, the radiologic technologists have provided detailed information about personal medical diagnostic radiologic imaging tests,, behavioral and medical risk factors, and information on cancer and other health outcomes. Occupational radiation doses for the study are being estimated by a multi-disciplinary team of dosimetrists, epidemiologists and statisticians. Individual radiation doses are expected to be available for cohort participants by the end of 2011.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain support in analyzing data and preparing manuscripts to publish the results from the work performed in the studies noted above. The contractor shall provide support in the analysis and preparation/revision of manuscripts in two main scientific areas:</p>
<p>a) Etiology of Brain/Central Nervous System Tumors <br />b) Low Dose Radiation from Occupational Medical Sources</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide support for 14 manuscripts at various authorship levels (first, senior, and second). The contractor shall be experienced in epidemiologic investigations and data analyses in NCI studies related to Brain /CNS tumors and low dose radiation. The contractor shall provide support in analyzing data, drafting tables and manuscripts, revising or provide comments on manuscripts until it is ready for submission. The contractor shall also rework and reformat the articles for resubmission.</p>
<p>The contractor shall have a Ph.D. in cancer epidemiology, graduate-level training in genetic epidemiology and radiation and other environmental exposure assessment, and at least five years of internationally-recognized experience working on etiologic and genetic studies of brain/CNS tumors, and in epidemiologic research on low-level ionizing radiation and cancer with at least 35 scientific papers on epidemiologic studies in these areas published in peer reviewed journals.. He/she shall have experience with leadership of large, multi-center international collaborations, as well as recognized leadership roles in consortia of investigators working on epidemiologic studies of brain/CNS epidemiology and/or epidemiologic studies of low-dose occupational radiation exposures. More specifically, the contractor shall be knowledgeable in the classification of brain tumors, and should have detailed knowledge of radiation dosimetry methods.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Dr Rajaraman has served as a member on the Advisory Committee for the Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium (BTEC) and based on her professional contacts with the leaders of the field, in this committee, she was able to launch a multinational GWAS study of Glioma in 2009. Dr. Rajaraman served on the program committee for the annual meetings for the 2009 ASA Radiation Health Conference and on the program committee for BTEC 2008 and 2012 annual meetings. These international organizations are prestigious in the world of Brain/Central Nervous System (CNS) tumor and radiation epidemiology research. Because of Dr. Rajaraman's involvement in these organizations, her competence, and her proven skills in analysis of complex epidemiologic data,, she has developed a very wide network of scientists that she can approach to obtain specific data and information that are not available in the open literature. This is crucial to the expeditious and successful completion of this contract.<br /><br />Dr. Rajaraman is an exceptional scientist with rigorous epidemiology training, a strong exposure assessment background, and notable molecular and genetic epidemiology expertise. She has extensive experience in epidemiologic fieldwork and in depth knowledge, training and experience in carrying out epidemiologic and genetic research on adult brain tumors, and is an expert on low dose protracted radiation exposure in relation to cancer risks. She has been invited to lecture on these topics for a variety of scientific meetings. <br />Dr Rajaraman's extensive professional experience and leadership role in two key areas makes her highly qualified to carry out the proposed work. From 2008 to 2011, she was the principle Investigator for the GliomaScan: Cohort-based Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of Glioma. She has been a co-leader on the multi institutional USRT study from 2005 to 2011. The NCI knows of no other source that has the unique set of training, knowledge and experience that REB requires for these tasks. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for a competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST, on January 12, 2012. For further information, please contact Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at Melissa.Ward@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

(TDSI) of Arlington, VA to procure the necessary Depot Level Specialized Test Equipment (STE) and access to the relevant technical specifications, drawings, schematics, and procedures in order for the US Navy to establish Depot Level Support for the AN/AQS-22 Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS). This effort will deliver the necessary STE and data to Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) in Jacksonville, FL. The procurement supports the MH-60R Aircraft Program and is to be executed by the H-60 Support Equipment Team, located at Joint Base McQuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Lakehurst, NJ. The effort will include the selection, production, shipment and installation of the necessary STE required for the Navy to perform Depot Level Repair of the Transducer Assembly (TA), Reeling Machine, Reeling Machine Interface Unit (RMIU) and Reeling Machine Control Unit (RMCU) components of the ALFS system. This equipment was originally produced by Thales Underwater Systems (TUS) of France. The effort will include all data necessary to establish the necessary logistics support (including training, publications, and calibration) of the STE, access to the technical information required to repair the above subsystems, as well as training in the repair of those subsystems.<br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate this procurement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not possess sufficient data, drawings, or other specifications to permit full and open competition. In order to complete the effort the US Navy is currently pursuing, the vendor that is awarded the contract must be able to share all of the necessary schematics, specifications, drawings, software source code, processes and procedures to the FRCSE artisans so that they can effect repairs to the ALFS components. In addition, in order to select, produce, ship and install the STE required for the FRCSE artisans to test and troubleshoot the components, the vendor must have access to all of this technical information as well. TUS has designated TDSI, in writing, as the corporation in the United States that they will be working with, and has granted them exclusive rights to the technical data for the purposes of completing the acquisition of the STE and forwarding the required technical information to the FRCSE artisans to support the initiation of organic depot support for the ALFS. As such, TDSI is the only responsible source that can supply the necessary STE, technical information and training required by the US Navy.<br /><br />Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement in writing. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) Database. The internet website is http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/ccringq or www.ccr.gov. It is mandatory to register with the CCR as your DUNS Number (Data Universal Numbering System) and your CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense. In addition, all invoices will be electronically submitted in the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the upcoming solicitation for Maintenance & Repair of Railroad Trackage.  The work includes, but is not limited to, providing maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, and minor construction for the railroad trackage and facilities at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, the main line extending from Camp Lejeune to the Havelock wye, and the rail and switches through the long ties on the New Bern to Morehead City rail line servicing MCAS Cherry Point.  
The proposed contract listed here is 100 percent small business set-aside.
  The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns.
The Government intends to use Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal and a price (or cost) proposal for evaluation by the Government.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 488210 with a size standard of $7,000,000.00.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus two 1-year options.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six (6) months under the Option to Extend Services clause.
  The Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.  
This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded 1 October 2006.  This requirement was previously satisfied with a combination Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The contract period was for a base year and four option years.  The FFP portion of the contract was valued at approximately $186,000 per year, and the IDIQ portion of the contract was valued at approximately $296,000 per year.  This contract utilized Performance Based Work Statement.  RFP N40085-11-R-8016 was solicited as HUBZone set-aside.  No offers were received from HUBZone firms at closing.  Due to a compelling need for the continuation of these services, the Contracting Officer approved award of a six-month interim contract to the incumbent and cancelled RFP N40085-11-R-8016.
  Based on the lack of offers received and the historical success of award and performance under the Small Business set-aside, it is determined appropriate to re-solicit this requirement as a 100% Small Business set-aside.  The requirement is being re-procured because the existing contract is expiring 31 March 2012.  The incumbent contractor is T&C Clearning and Railroad, Inc. 
Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at www.neco.navy.mil when it becomes available.  This solicitation is available in electronic format only.  Most documents will be in the Adobe Acrobat PDF file format via the internet.  The free Acrobat Reader, required to view the PDF files, can be downloaded from the Adobe website.
  
Contractors are encouraged to register for the solicitation when downloading from the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website.  Only registered contractors will be notified by email when amendments to the solicitation are issued.  
Please direct questions to Clifton Gaither via email at clifton.gaither@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>R--Facilitator for Combined Force Maritime Component Commander Course(CFFMC) and Executive Level of War Course(ELOC)conducted by the US Naval War College, Newport RI.
<SOLNBR>N0012412T0153
<CONTACT>Sheila K. Valloney 4018413727
<DESC>The U.S. Naval War College has a requirement for an individual to conduct a non-resident Combined Force Maritime Component Commander (CFMCC) course in the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii area and an Executive Level Operational Level of War (ELOC) in Newport, Rhode Island. The CFMCC course is taught in this area to support regional maritime commanders and senior leaders attending (as students) and lecturing (as guest speakers) at the course.  NWC resident faculty members prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses.  Because the course attendees are 1 and 2 star US and foreign flag officers, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course.
 The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, operational experience in maritime warfare at senior/executive levels, familiarity with the regional maritime issues, an understanding of Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level. The ELOC course is tailored for an officer in the rank/pay-grade of Navy Captain/O-6 on the numbered fleet staff to bridge educational gaps between courses offered for the Flag level and those offered to officers in the pay-grades of O-2 through O-5.  The course is taught at the NWC campus in Newport, RI with students assigned TAD for the week long ELOC. NWC resident faculty prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses.
  Because the course attendees are senior O-6s, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course. The qualifications for this position are unique and identical to those required to support the CFMCC course.
  For these reasons the Naval War College, Contracting Division, intends to award a Sole Source/Firm-Fixed price contract to David C. Nichols, Apollo Beach Florida. VADM (Ret) Nichols has fleet experience as Fifth Fleet Commander and Deputy Commander, US Central Command which gives him the necessary expertise and perspective for facilitating the CFMCC course in Pearl Harbor, HI and the ELOC course in Newport RI. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c) (1) and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), the supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.
  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government. Even though the intent is to award a sole source contract, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

The solicitation (RFQ) number will be N00124-12-T-0153 and is expected to be issued on or about 12/29/2012 with a closing date of 5JAN2012.
Questions may be directed to sheila.valloney@usnwc.edu

However, any firm believing it capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541330.   Please submit relevant documentation in writing to:  US EPA, ATTN:  Greta Perry, 26 W. Martin Luther King, Mail Stop: Norwood, Cincinnati, OH 45268 or fax your request to (513)487-2107, or email perry.greta@epa.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

With a specialized crisis response team and a vast national network, the EAP's goal is to minimize the potential impact of a traumatic event by helping to return the situation to normal as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The FDA EAP is a confidential, diagnostic and educational program providing assessment, short-term counseling and referral services free of charge for FDA employees, their families, and contractors where applicable. The EAP helps employees, their spouses, family members living in the employee's household, and other legal dependents with assistance in the areas of:</p>
<p>&#61607; Work-related issues<br />&#61607; Family or personal relationship issues<br />&#61607; Stress-related illness<br />&#61607; Alcohol and substance abuse problems<br />&#61607; Psychological and psychiatric disorders<br />&#61607; Grief and loss<br />&#61607; Legal or financial concerns<br />&#61607; Other issues (e.g., care of elderly parents, retirement)</p>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dycoda, LLC for the procurement of technical support in developing, executing, and documenting the MELCOR analysis of the Peach Bottom Unit 3 Spent Fuel Pool (SFP). A scoping study is being performed that combines structural and seismic assessments, more detailed mechanistic modeling of fuel heatup and potential fission product behavior, realistic treatment of offsite emergency preparedness, and the current SFP regulatory requirements. NRC staff is performing MELCOR modeling of the Peach Bottom Unit 3 SFP to support the SFP Scoping Study; however, highly-specialized contractor assistance is required on the MELCOR analyses for the Peach Bottom Unit 3 SFP, to augment the staff's efforts to estimate the effect on SFP accident consequences of a reduced amount of spent nuclear fuel being stored in the SFP. This estimation will be made with a focus on realistic MELCOR analysis. Dycoda, LLC is the only commercially available source that is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work. The estimated period of performance is seven and one half months. This notice is prepared under the authority of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Ashlee Bushell via email at Ashlee.Bushell@nrc.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. EST, on Friday, December 9, 2011. No request for quotation document is available and verbal request will not be honored. Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. No contractual document will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.

Ultimately, these delays would result in clinical hold, potentially cancelation of the study and additional costs.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. <br><br>Place of Delivery - Fort Detrick, Maryland<br><br>Set-aside Status: Unrestricted<br>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 1977, four Columbia River treaty tribes including the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, formed the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources and to protect their reserved treaty rights through the exercise of inherent sovereign powers of the tribes.&nbsp; The organization conducts business through one joint decision-making body referred to as the "Commission", which is made up of the respective tribe's fish and wildlife representatives, and operates on a consensus basis.&nbsp; The tribe's decision making authority is based in part on reserved treaty right in the Columbia Basin, statutes, case law and derivative documents such as The Pacific Salmon Treaty, and In-Lieu Sites legislation.&nbsp; Coordination with each tribe's respective fisheries management agency helps keep CRITFC aligned with tribal programs.&nbsp; CRITFC is the only existing organization which represents these tribes in treaty fishery related matters and has been a cornerstone for many successes in the restoration of salmon and the protection of treaty rights. You can find more information about CRITFC at <a href="http://www.critfc.org/"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">www.critfc.org</span></a>.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Sterilization Indicators and Controls. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is June 2012</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Sterilization Indicators and Controls. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $3,065,850.55. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 15 of the total 213 line items account for 80.29% ($2,461,613.84) of the total volume in sales $ 3,065,850.55 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </span></strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs</strong>. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.</strong> <br />1.

Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. <strong>Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO South verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. </strong>Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. The six items listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>Item Description Number Each to Send Material Description<br />Biological Indicator 25 each Rapid readout biological indicator, steam and flash (3 hour read out)<br />Chemical Process Indicator 50 each Chemical indicator strip for steam (250 degree F, 270 degree) <br />Biological Indicator 50 each Biological indicator for steam vacuum assisted or gravity sterilizers (48 hr readout)<br />Biological Indicator 50 each Indicator Sterilization Biological Plasma (24 hour incubation period)<br />Chemical Integrator for steam 50 each Integrator with extender and paper wick and steam and temperature sensitive chemical pellet contained in a paper/film and foil laminate envelope of laminate materials<br />Blue Sterilization Indicator Tape, Steam 1in x 60yd 2 rolls Blue Sterilization Indicator Tape (for use with disposable wraps), Steam 1in x 60yd roll</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 12 MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing Hospital Aquired Infections (HAI)) The Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class I External Tape and Strip) are easy to attach to a wrapped tray and/or instrument pan. Chemical Process Indicators tape and strips must attach easily and securely to items being sterilized to be able to determine a successful sterilization process.</p>
<p>2. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing HAI) The chemical process indicator (Plasma, Orthophthalaldehyde, Peracetic Acid, Glutaraldehyde) will clearly differentiate between processed and unprocessed products by color change (per manufacturer guidelines) when exposed to a sterilization process cycle. It is important for the Clinician to clearly differentiate between pre and post cycle on the indicator.</p>
<p>3. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing HAI) Steam Integrator indicator will confirm package sterility with a color change (per manufacturer guidelines) to all monitoring areas on the indicator strip, steam integrator indicators must be pre-printed with easily identifiable temperature parameter on strip (i.e. 250&deg; F, 270&deg; F). Following exposure to steam penetration, temperature and time (critical parameters for sterility), the integrator strip color change confirms that sterilization conditions have been met. Steam Integrator indicators will be placed in package/pouch (according to manufacturer instructions) for processing using an empty load steam process cycle.</p>
<p>4. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing HAI) A biological indicator read-out/result of negative growth, post sterilization process, indicates sterility has been achieved which allows sterilized package item to be released for use. In a biological indicator challenge, the sterilization process, using an item impregnated with a known quantity of microorganisms demonstrates the effectiveness of the sterilization process by the organisms' inability to continue growth.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government.

 It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 


(a) The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quote. 

(i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(4)  Quoting contractors shall submit sufficient technical data for products quoted for the Government to perform a technical evaluation. Failure to provide sufficient technical data will render as unacceptable and shall not be evaluated further for award.
  
(ii) DELIVERY SCEHDULE will be used to make a determination of how quickly the quoting contractor can deliver the Rotary Screw Air Compressor and other related parts. Quotes should, therefore, provide their best realistic delivery schedule to demonstrate they are responsive to the Governments URGENT need. 
(iii) PRICE

(b) Quotes shall be evaluated and determined by the contracting officer to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable under Factor (i) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY. Only those quotes determined technically acceptable under fact (i) Technical Acceptability will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). In the second step of evaluating quotes Factor (ii) DELIVERY SCHEDULE, will be evaluated and quotes shall be determined acceptable or unacceptable under this factor.
 Only those quotes that are determined as having an acceptable under Factor (ii) DELIVERY SCHEDULE shall be further evaluated for award.  

Factor (i): TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY is more important than Factor (ii) Delivery or Factor (iii) PRICE. Factor (ii): Delivery is more important than Factor (iii) PRICE. 
When combined, factor (i) and (ii) are more important than factor (iii). 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with quoting Contractors. Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractor best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 

Quoting contractors commercial catalog or technical data submitted shall be reviewed against the specifications of the individual CLINS herein.
 Only those contractors quotes that provide technical data or provide a commercial catalog that demonstrates the proposed items meet the salient characteristics shall be given a rating of acceptable for factor (i); TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. If a determination cant be made that the technical data submitted demonstrates that proposed items meet the minimum salient characteristics as specified herein and/or the technical point of contact cannot interpret submitted documentation as meeting these characteristics the quoting contractor will be given a unacceptable for factor (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. If the technical representative and/or the contracting officer is incapable of determining its equality to the salient characteristics through the submitted documentation the contractors quote will be given an unacceptable for factor (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY.
 

Quotes which can meet the Governments required delivery schedule of January 31, 2012 will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Contractors quote rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the quotes of other quoting contractors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate submitted Quoting Contractors DELIVERY SCHEDULE as follows:

SATISFACTORY: Capable of meeting the Governments January 31, 2012 delivery date. Quote receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

HIGHLY SATISFACTORY: Exceeds the required delivery schedule of January 31, 2012, by quoting a delivery of schedule of earlier than January 31, 2012.
  

UNSATISFACTORY: Not capable of meeting the Governments January 31, 2012 delivery schedule. 

(g) A written notice of award or acceptance of an quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoting contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order, once the quoting contractor performs under the order or returns a signed (if requested) copy of the order to the Purchasing Agent. Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Addendum to 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  See Below Addendum to 52.212-2:<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>Paragraph (a) is hereby replaced with the following:<br><br>The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its contents.  A proposal that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such proposals may be determined unacceptable.  <br><br>Prior to being considered for award, an offeror shall fully demonstrate that it possesses the capabilities which the Government has determined essential to the reliable, efficient and timely accomplishment of the required services.<br><br>Award will be made using the lowest-price, technically-acceptable source selection process.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the proposal that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <br><br>(1) meets the acceptability standards for non-price factors,<br>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<br>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<br>(4) is from a responsible offer(as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9),<br>and <br>(5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <br><br>Technical acceptability will be determined through an evaluation of the offeror's technical proposal. <br><br>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  <br>     <br>Evaluation Factors.  The following factors will be evaluated:<br>        <br>Factors 1.  Technical Merit.  Technical merit ratings reflect the Government's confidence in each offeror's ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  In evaluating the proposal risk, the Government will make an independent judgment of the probability of success, the impact of failure and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.<br><br>1.  Technical Merit shall be based on the review of the Compensation Plan, with primary emphasis on the employee salary amount. - The compensation plan shall include the break down of the contractor's compensation plan demonstrating employee salary amount, employee fringe benefits, as well as company profit overhead and G&A.<br><br>2.  An effective and realistic compensation plan for the geographic area of service (i.e. Maryland, Washington D.C. & Virginia).  The government will reject offers which propose contract hourly wage rates below those prevailing in the geographic areas.<br><br>Note:  Offerors must meet the experience requirement as outlined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-1.  Proposals that do not meet the mandatory experience requirement will not be considered further for award.]<br><br>The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating each offeror's technical proposal.  <br><br>Pass- To receive this rating, the offeror shall present a proposal that clearly and comprehensively addresses the technical factor.  The offeror shall provide sufficient details for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation.  The proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is capable of performing the requirement for the total proposed price indicated in its proposal, and has adequate recruitment and retention plans.   The primary determinant will be the employee salary amount to the individual HCP.  Offerors must propose a base salary which is at least commensurate with salaries paid for similar health care providers in the local area in order to be technically acceptable.  This salary in almost all instances exceeds the prevailing wage rates in the Department of Labor's wage determination for a locality.  A low, or no compensation plan, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements or appropriate compensation levels for geographic area where performance will take place. <br><br>Fail - This rating will be assessed on any offeror that presents a proposal that demonstrates any of the following:<br><br>1.	Fails to clearly and comprehensively the technical evaluation factors or submit a technical plan.<br><br>2.	Fails to provide sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation in addressing the factor.<br><br>3.	Fails to clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is technically capable to perform the requirements at its total proposed price.<br><br>4.	Fails to propose a base salary which is at least commensurate with salaries paid for similar health care providers in the local area.<br><br>Factor 2.  Price and Financial Capability.  <br><br>Price will be evaluated separately from the technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability in terms of:<br><br>A.  That the prices are consistent with and reflect the proposed staffing requirement.<br><br>B.  Offerors are cautioned that an unrealistically low price, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal, either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the required services, or he has made an imprudent offer.<br><br>C.  Compensation for health care providers (employee) shall not exceed $400,000 per year for personal services IAW Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1091 and DoD Instruction 6025.5.<br><br>D.  Impartial consideration will be given to all offers received in response to this solicitation.  Offers will be evaluated to determine compliance with all requirements of the solicitation, including any attachments and exhibits.  The evaluation criteria will be applied to all offers in the same manner.  Each proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its content and the Government will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's proposal.<br><br>E.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>F.  Price analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offeror's proposal, but will not be scored.  Pricing will be evaluated for realism and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Government's requirements.  The Government is interested in proposals that meet the requirements with acceptable risk, at a fair and reasonable price.  The submitted financial statements and/or evidence of a line of credit will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining offeror responsibility.     <br><br>(End of Addendum to FAR 52.212-2) <br><br>(x) Offerors will include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its Offer.<br>(xi) The Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition as well as any addendum.  <br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-4<br>(u) The non-FAR Part 12 discretionary FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and LOCAL clauses included herein are incorporated into this contract either by reference or in full text.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the agency. <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Yalcin Umurtak<br />Project Manager<br />HEMA DOGAL ENERJ&#304; KAYNAKLARI A.S.<br />Buyukdere Caddesi, Ucyol Mevkii No: 53<br />Maslak/Sisli/Istanbul<br />Republic of Turkey<br />Phone: +90 (533) 692-1033<br />Fax: +90 212 286 6562</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of a combined coal bed methane (CBM) extraction and power generation project at the Grantee's coalfield. The primary objective of the Study is to provide the Grantee with recommendations for an optimum combined gas extraction and power generation project and a financing plan to implement the project. The Study will involve various aspects for the development of CBM, including drilling and extraction, gas processing and compression requirements, on-site power generation using a combined cycle gas turbine technology, and related infrastructure requirements for piping the gas and selling the electricity to the Turkish Grid.</p>
<p>Turkey's power consumption is currently at a rate of intensity that is more than twice that of the European Union average. In order to meet rising demand and reduce the country's energy security risk, the Government of Turkey is seeking to diversify its supply of energy. Turkey's current energy mix is heavily dependent on imported oil and natural gas. The demand for natural gas demand has grown ten-fold since 1990, and this rapid increase has increased Turkey's energy security risk, especially since 98 percent is imported from neighboring countries. Together, Turkey's high energy intensity and growing dependence on natural gas make steps toward resource diversification and heightened energy efficiency high-priority domestic policy goals.</p>
<p>Coalbed methane recovery and utilization presents an opportunity for Turkey to lessen its dependence on imported gas, while also providing an alternative means to produce cleaner energy from coal. Through a competitive international bidding process in 2005, the Grantee was awarded a coal mining and coalbed methane (CBM) exploration concession by the government-owned Turkish Hard Coal Enterprises (TTK). The concession area of the Grantee is 6,890 square kilometers. The concession documents state the dual rights of the Grantee to (i) coal mining and sales to the Turkish market and (ii) CBM production and sales to the Turkish natural gas grid, while also reserving the right to use part or all of the CBM to power a gas-fired power plant to be built in the area.</p>
<p>The Grantee is developing several projects aimed at the extraction of CBM and its conversion into energy including electric power. The firm set up a CBM Project Group at its Amasra location and started developing the proposed CBM Project in 2007. Many of the initial tasks of the project have been completed, and the Grantee has already invested more than $12 million in drilling CBM wells to ensure that there is substantial resource of CBM. Initial results from these activities indicate that the gas level is sufficient for CBM extraction and utilization for a power plant using one gas turbine-generator. Accordingly, the Grantee is interested in an independently prepared feasibility study evaluating the CBM extraction potential, designs for the power plant, and a sound economic and financial analysis that the firm can use for implementation financing and technology selection. The Study will involve various aspects for the development of CBM, including drilling and extraction, gas processing and compression requirements, on-site power generation using a combined cycle gas turbine technology, and related infrastructure requirements for piping the gas and selling the electricity to the Turkish Grid.</p>
<p>The Grantee is a private Turkish corporation established in 1973 and is part of a group of nine companies under the Hattat Holding, Inc. The Grantee has the staff and technical capacity to manage the CBM project along with its coal mining operations over the long term. Although CBM extraction is a relatively new concept in Turkey, the Grantee, deriving from its technical knowledge and experience of oil and natural gas exploration, is well-equipped to implement the project.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$449,960 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, LOCAL TIME, JANUARY 31, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 1977, four Columbia River treaty tribes including the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, formed the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources and to protect their reserved treaty rights through the exercise of inherent sovereign powers of the tribes.&nbsp; The organization conducts business through one joint decision-making body referred to as the "Commission", which is made up of the respective tribe's fish and wildlife representatives, and operates on a consensus basis.&nbsp; The tribe's decision making authority is based in part on reserved treaty right in the Columbia Basin, statutes, case law and derivative documents such as The Pacific Salmon Treaty, and In-Lieu Sites legislation.&nbsp; Coordination with each tribe's respective fisheries management agency helps keep CRITFC aligned with tribal programs.&nbsp; CRITFC is the only existing organization which represents these tribes in treaty fishery related matters and has been a cornerstone for many successes in the restoration of salmon and the protection of treaty rights. You can find more information about CRITFC at <a href="http://www.critfc.org/"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">www.critfc.org</span></a>.</span></p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br /><br />Introduction<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Munitions Directorate is interested in developing far-term plans that may lead to innovative means to functionally defeat well-defended, hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs). The Munitions Directorate, with support from other AFRL Directorates, such as Directed Energy and Sensors, seeks to become better acquainted with and better understand innovative concepts and technologies that may be developed and applied over the next twenty (20) years to functionally defeat (deny, disrupt, or destroy) HDBTs. This may also include technologies that could improve HDBT functional assessment leading to a better capability to locate and characterize the targets. The purpose of this Request is to solicit concepts and relevant technology investment areas, assess technical maturity levels, examine top-level development timelines, and begin defining conceptual trade spaces. The requirements are described below:<br /><br />Target Scenario<br />(1) The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek information from all sources on innovative methods to functionally defeat the operation of a well-defended, hardened/deeply buried facility located within an unfriendly country. These innovative methods must be based on emerging technology or on technology that can reasonably be expected to be available by 2031. Emphasis should be placed on concepts/technologies that would functionally defeat such a facility for a given amount of time. Functional Defeat is defined as denial, disruption, or destruction of a facility's ability to accomplish its intended mission for a desired period. It is realized that this time period may not be easily defined. It will depend on the efficacy of the attack solution. Emphasis shall be placed on functional defeat systems that can be delivered to the HDBT or its close vicinity by current or projected delivery platforms. It is understood that some ambiguity must exist about the construction and intended use of the HDBT. For the purpose of this Request, it will be assumed that the HDBT functions as a key command, control, and communication node. Emphasis may be placed on directed energy applications for target location/characterization or for defeat mechanisms, either of which may be delivered to the vicinity of the target by conventional Air Force strike platforms, manned or unmanned. However, it is emphasized that this Request is not intended to pursue information, research, or development in regard to atomic or thermonuclear warheads.
<p>(2) For purposes of this RFI, the HDBT is assumed to be a tunnel complex with two portals built into the base of a granite mountain. The granite over layer is assumed to be 60 meters thick over both portals and 80 meters over the facility's mission space. Metallic blast doors are closed and hermetically sealed at both portals. The two tunnels are assumed to be 100 feet in length with directional turns. The facility is constructed on a single level and occupies between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p>(3) The HDBT makes use of state-of-the-art computers and communication equipment. It is tied to the local electricity grid but has a large capacity diesel generator to produce its electricity when the need arises. The facility draws fresh water from an internal deep well. Sewage is held in holding tanks and removed periodically. All incoming air passes through state-of-the-art biological/chemical filters.</p>
<p>(4) The specifications of this HDBT have been deliberately left vague. Any questions related to subsystem characteristics and capacities may be directed to Ms Pamela Pitchford and Mr. Charles Cottrell (AFRL/RWAS). However, the answers to those hypothetical questions, if provided, may also not be specific. Be aware that all data with regard to this Scenario are notional and do not represent any known target.</p>
<p>Response Requirements<br />The following should be included in any response:<br />1. Describe conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Target Scenario.<br />2. Provide a top-level development schedule, based on the conceptual approach, leading toward the Technology Readiness Levels of 5 or greater.<br />3.&nbsp; Limit response to ten (10) pages, single spaced.<br /><br />Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging near-term technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to address the functional defeat of the HDBT. All technologies or suggested concepts should be available for proof of concept demonstration by the Air Force within the nominal twenty (20) years after the issue of this Request.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government will evaluate the respondent's capabilities based on the following: <br />a) Thorough understanding of the Scenario requirements; b) Identification of conceptual approaches and requisite technologies to comply with the requirements specified in the Scenario; c) Description of the rough magnitude of potential costs to develop the requisite technologies to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or greater; and <br />d) Top-level development schedule. All responses should be limited to ten (10) pages, single spaced, and are to include the organization name, address, business point of contact/phone number/email address, and technical point of contact/phone number/email address.<br />Respondents to this RFI should stipulate any assumptions used in the development of their response. The Air Force anticipates that respondents will respond to the information request to the best of their ability with as much of the requested information as time permits by the specified deadline. No extensions to the schedule are foreseen.<br />This RFI is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. The Air Force may contact a respondent for more information or clarification purposes. The Air Force does not commit to contacting a respondent or providing any feedback on a response. The Air Force does not intend to issue any findings or reports outside the Air Force resulting from the RFI. Due to the expedited timeline, questions may be submitted with the RFI response and may be considered in any potential future solicitations. <br />Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil. Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) Functional Defeat. Responses must be received no later than 0800 Central Time on 01 February 2012. For technical questions, please contact Ms. Pamela Pitchford, AFRL/RWAS, pamela.pitchford@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2505, or Mr. Charles Cottrell, AFRL/RWAS, charles.cottrell@eglin.af.mil, 850-883-2723.<br /><br />DISTRIBUTION A. Approved for public release, distribution unlimited. (96ABW-2011-0541)</p>

<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, Space and Missiles System Center Space Superiority &amp; Development Planning Directorates (SMC/SYK), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA, 90245</p>
<p>I. Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1. The SMC Development Planning Directorate (XR) is issuing this presolicitation notice to provide the industrial base with information about XR's CHIRP+ WFOV payload acquisition and upcoming market research plans.</p>
<p>2. XR and the Infrared Systems Directorate (IS) are planning to hold an industry day in the second half of January 2012 to communicate to industry SMC's plan to procure up to three wide-field-of-view (WFOV), overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors to be launched as hosted payloads or free-flier rideshares. XR and IS will also present to industry how these sensors will fit into IS's OPIR architecture and discuss future plans for integrating, launching and operating these sensors. In addition, this will be the only opportunity for companies interested in building the sensors to provide Statements of Capability (SOCs) to the Government. The Government will also&nbsp;be offering interested companies the opportunity to have one-on-one meetings with program office representatives. The market research for the CHIRP+ procurement will be based mainly on the SOCs received at industry day; no sources sought synopsis will be posted on FBO either before or after the industry day.</p>
<p>3. The only procurement currently being actively coordinated is for the development and delivery of high TRL (Technology Readiness Level), flight-capable sensors. The sensors will be either 6-degree or 9-degree WFOV IR sensors intended for use primarily for battlespace awareness and secondarily for other OPIR missions. Cost will be a very important consideration, due to funding limitations. Currently, the Government is limited to spending $40 million or less per sensor. The Government intends to award three contracts for sensors to be developed and delivered within a 36-month schedule.</p>
<p>4. Two weeks prior to industry day, the Government will release the following documents and information: A draft Statement of Work (SOW); a draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD); SOC content and format requirements; and logistical specifics of the industry day. Currently, the industry day is planned to be held at SMC in El Segundo, California. The SOW and TRD are currently being drafted, and no drafts have been released to industry yet. The first draft releases will be for the formal industry day notice, which the Government plans to post to FBO in the first half of January.</p>
<p>5. The Government is building a bidder's library where finalized draft documents will be posted. The draft SOW and TRD for Industry Day will be posted to this site as soon as they are ready. The process for gaining access to this site can take up to two weeks, so contractors are highly encouraged to apply immediately. The following information is relevant to gaining access:</p>
<p>a. The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide will inform your organization of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>b. All contractors need to fill out the Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875.<br /><br />&nbsp; i. Regarding the DD2875, Part 1 needs to be completely filled out by the Contractor and the form then returned to Contracting POC designated below. Parts 2 through 4 will be completed by the Government. Please use the DD2875 template attached to this posting and do not change any fields that have already been completed.<br /><br />c. Prior to submitting the DD2875, a contractor must obtain an Information Assurance Certificate&nbsp;via the following link to the IA CBT: http://iase.disa.mil/eta/iaav9/iaa_v9/index.htm</p>
<p>d. Every contractor must have an External Certification Authority (ECA) or a Common Access Card (CAC) to use the Livelink environment. The ECA's are available at http://www.verisign.com/dod-interoperability/index.html. Contractors should purchase from this website.</p>
<p>e. Only contractors with SECRET Clearance verified through JPAS will be allowed to access the Bidder's Library. <br /><br />The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide, Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875 have been attached to this pre-notice. The Livelink User Agreement, SAAR Form DD2875, and a copy of the IA CBT Certificate should be submitted to the points of contact listed in Section II of this notice NLT 3 January, 2012 to allow sufficient time to process and approve access to the bidder's library.</p>
<p>6. The Government encourages participation from the small, disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>II. Point of Contact: All communication associated with this presolicitation notice and the upcoming industry day shall be submitted via email to the contracting POC for this procurement, Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil. The alternate POC is Mr. Andrew Mitchell, at Andrew.mitchell.ctr@losangeles.af.mil.<br /><br />III.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), in the interest of economy and efficiency, this procurement is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order that was placed in accordance with applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.<br /><br />The SEC has a requirement to place a logical follow on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order in the interest of economy and efficiency. The action is for continued technical support for the Office of Financial Management's (OFM) Budget and Program Performance Analysis System (BPPAS) which is an SEC-specific financial subsystem built on the Performance Cost Management (PCM) software suite licensed from Business Objects SAP. BPPAS contains two complex financial subsystems supporting the agency's Budget Formulation and Execution and Activity-Based Costing (ABC) programs. The technical support also includes help desk and technical services support for the Budget Formulation and Execution Subsystem as well as additional detailed system documentation and transition services. The order for PCM technical support, system documentation, and for BFE help desk and technical services support is for a six (6) month period from January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012 with an option for an additional three (3) month period from July 1 to September 30, 2012. <br /><br />The incumbent BPPAS contractor, Delta Solutions, currently holds a GSA schedule contract (GS-35F-5362H) during the period of May 13, 2008 to May 12, 2013.
