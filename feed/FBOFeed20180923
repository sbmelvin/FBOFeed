The Government intends to award a single firm fixed price purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is anticipated to be a sole source award to Comcast Communications LLC, as their pricing is the most advantageous to the Government due to loyalty program pricing and incentives. In addition, cancelling the current accounts would nearly double service costs and increase installation charges with a new vendor. Finally, the vast geographic parameters for service covers Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska, and Comcast is the only provider that can service the entire area.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistic Center San Diego – Seal Beach Detachment intends to issue a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 to ANSYS Inc, 2600 ANSYS Drive, Canonsburg, PA 15317. The proposed contract action is for a license and a license renewal for NAVFAC’s Mooring Analysis equipment currently in place.   

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The AQWA Suite software is proprietary to ANSYS and is currently installed as NAVFAC EXWC’s primary tool for required to continue its mooring design and analysis which is tasked to NAVFAC EXWC directly by Navy Expeditionary Program Office (NEPO).
 Updated licenses are required annually to ensure all software is operating optimally and the Navy receives the most accurate data for analysis.  Changing NAVFAC EXWC’s INLS support and planning software would require an entire overhaul of existing systems and require exorbitant man-hours of system engineering, putting operational NAVFAC EXWS and NEPO capabilities and accuracies at risk. Accordingly, ANSYS is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this software.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

(AGI) 220 Valley Creek Blvd, Exton, PA 19341-2380. The proposed contract action is for Systems Tool Kit (STK) and Orbital Determination Tool Kit (ODK) software and patch updates which support NAVSOC’s Orbital Analysis System (OAS).

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and as implemented under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The STK and ODK software is proprietary to AGI is currently installed on the NAVSOC Orbital Analysis System (OAS) and is used to perform orbital determination, predict exact location of the satellites, provide on-orbit event timelines and to plan maneuvers for collision avoidance.
NAVSOC has engineered applications and interfaces to work directly with STK and together with ODK are critical to NAVSOC Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  License renewals and patch updates are required to keep this software in use, up to date and accurate.  Changing NAVSOCs orbital analysis software would require an entire overhaul of existing systems and require exorbitant man-hours of system engineering putting operational satellites at risk due to loss of orbital analysis and collision avoidance capabilities. Accordingly, AGI is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this software.  

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
