<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the upgrade and support of an Optech, Inc., Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM), 1 ea.  In addition to the upgrade, technical support for (1) training, (2) periods of installation and operational use, and (3) data processing will be provided. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Optech, Inc., as the only known responsible source who can meet Agency requirements. There are no other sources that have the unique capability to supply the technical expertise needed to upgrade the lasers. Optech is the manufacturer of the equipment and all replacement parts are available only from Optech. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become familiar enough to upgrade the equipment and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 17, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement. This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement. The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to increase the capacity and ability of Brazilian counterparts to effectively promote sustainable energy generation and use through the provision of training and capacity building activities in the following areas: Energy Sector Regulation; Energy Efficiency Concepts & Technologies; Renewable Energy Project Development; and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency Financing.  Since 1996, USAID/Brazil has financed an Energy Program supporting the Government of Brazil's(GOB) energy sector restructuring and privatization efforts.  The overarching goal of this program has been to reduce the threats of climate change by focusing on the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  While the program has many accomplishments, notably in the fields of policy and regulatory reform and technical capacity building, a number of barriers continue to limit the implementation of these technologies in the marketplace. Despite economic, environmental and societal benefits of renewable energy technologies, the market implementation of these by potential users, governments and utilities has been far short of the potential. Barriers to the effective application of these technologies include policies that have limited effectiveness in achieving the needed market transformation and private sector participation, perceived economic/financial constraints, social perceptions, and lack of information about these technologies. Institutions, contractors, for profit and non profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this renewable energy program to be implemented in Brazil are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia. Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in some or all of the thematic areas: (i) Policy and Regulatory Framework: capacity building activities play an important role under this IR as they may be designed to: (a) help identify policies and regulations or lack of enforcement, that pose the most serious impediments to promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency; (b) promote institutional strengthening; and (c) allow for local institutions to learn from international regulatory experiences; (ii) Technology Transfer and Cooperation: workshops, trade missions and invitational travels are key tools for the promotion of U.S.?Brazilian trade and cooperation; and (iii) Market Development: insufficient information about renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies has prevented the development of these two markets in Brazil.  In addition, there is a lack of qualified professionals/entrepreneurs with adequate entrepreneurial capacity to design related projects, prepare business plans and feasibility studies, etc. USAID/Brazil encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 6, 2003. Proposals due date will be April 24, 2003.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of one complete operational HC36m Hypercomputer®, and license for use of the associated Viva software.   This purchase includes one complete operational HC36m Hypercomputer®  for FPGA-based computing, comprising at least a Pensa® PCB, configured Motherboard, Chassis with ancillary systems including a SCSI hard drive, and the VIVA 2.1 software with a one-seat license. The license shall be renewable annually for a period not to exceed five years. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Star Bridge Systems, Inc., (SBS) of Midvale, Utah, on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. SBS is the only known source which can meet agency needs under and competition is impractical for the following reasons: (1) Under a Loan Agreement, NASA/MSFC evaluated HAL (Hyper Algorithmic Logic)-15 Hypercomputer from SBS. The HAL-15 is the first of a new breed of high performance computer that replaces the traditional central processing units with faster Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These are specialty chips on a circuit board that can reconfigure themselves hundreds or thousands of times a second. This makes them 1000 times faster than traditional commercial CPUs. This maximizes the use of millions of transistors (gates) on each silicon array. HAL is programmed graphically using the company's proprietary programming language, VIVA. This language facilitates rapid custom software development by the system's users. NASA/MSFC will purchase HAL to continue to explore: digital signal processing; pattern recognition; reconfigurable computing; neural networks; genetic algorithms; and high speed parallel computing.   (2)The Hypercomputer/Viva hardware/software combination provides a complete turnkey solution for developing and executing highly parallel algorithms on powerful state-of-the art dynamically-alterable microcircuitry using an intuitive graphical interface and polymorphic visual programming language. The combination of these features provides a capability unique to these SBS products.  Interested firms have 10 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their capabilities and qualifications. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 10 days or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>Radiation Decontamination Program: SOL BAA03-13, proposals due April 21, 2003, POC: Mr. Thomas McCreery, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714. Facsimile: (703) 516-7360, E-mail: baa03-13@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred). Contractual point of contact: DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO), Attn: Mr. Mark Bennington, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714. Facsimile: (703) 696-2208; E-mail: mbennington@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred). OBJECTIVE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) from qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs and DOE laboratories for the Radiation Decontamination (RD) program under BAA 03-13. The threat exists that a terrorist group will set off a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), a so-called dirty bomb, generating a cloud of radioactive particles on or upwind of a military installation.  The overall goal of DARPA's Radiation Decontamination (RD) program is to develop a system of technologies that will allow for the detection, decontamination and controlled clean-up of radioactively contaminated buildings and military bases located downwind from an RDD event so that they can safely be reoccupied for military use.  For this purpose the threshold of contamination that is considered safe corresponds to an absorbed radiation of 1 milliSievert/year at a distance 1 meter from the building surface.  Offerors are free to team with any entity, including Federal and Department of Defense Laboratories. If an offeror intends to team with a federal entity, it should include a copy of the teaming arrangement or a signed commitment letter along with a description of the tasks the federal entity will perform and the costs associated with those tasks. ACQUISITION INFORMATION: DARPA requires that all parties interested in participating in this BAA register their organization by providing a principal point of contact, phone number, fax and email to baa03-13@darpa.mil with the SUBJECT LINE: Rad-Decon POC INFORMATION. DARPA will host a Pre-proposal Conference on 18 March 2003 at ANSER, 2900 South Quincy Street, Suite 800, Arlington, VA  22206. Each organization that plans to attend this meeting must indicate their intention by email to BAA03-13@darpa.mil, with the subject line, "BIDDERS CONFERENCE". In addition, each organization must provide the names of all planned attendees (using the same email address). Additional instructions will be provided to those who register. Registration to attend this meeting must be received no later than 14 March 2003. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA. Evaluations of all proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal considering the following general criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: a) Scientific and technical merit, b) Offeror qualifications, c) Cost realism. Specific criteria for each proposal category can be found in the PIP. Multiple awards are anticipated for the RD program. As a result of this BAA, DARPA may award traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and/or Other Transaction Agreements. No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-13 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and formats of abstracts and proposals. Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award. The PIP is not classified and may be obtained via the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo. Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be sent via email to baa03-13@darpa.mil. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) compilation will be posted on-line and periodically updated. The FAQ will also be found at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo. It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded beginning in May 2003. A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP. The Government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission. Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement. Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the following requirements: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation. Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose. Contractor personnel are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements. By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.

C. - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL The proposal shall contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed, by element of cost, for meaningful evaluation.  The estimate must include the total cost of the project and the amount and source of project funding (e.g., funds requested from Indian Head and/or funds to be provided by the proposing organization as cost sharing).  The offeror's cost share may take the form of academic training (such as Distance Learning and On-Campus Courses), equipment or access to unique facilities, independent research and development (IR&D), cash, foregone intellectual property rights, and other acceptable forms of in-kind contributions. (Note:    Work breakdown structures are neither required nor desired.  Cost/funding proposals should be organized to include four sections in the following order: total project cost, cost sharing and in-kind contributions, and cost to the Government.  Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a breakdown of costs of the project.  Cost should also be broken down on a task-by-task basis for each task appearing in the statement of work.  This should include all of the proposed cost to the Government and cost sharing by the offeror.  The following information should be presented in your proposal for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase, total offeror cost share; funding requested from the Government: and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of mone y).  Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market value of leased items, and the method used for marking such evaluations.  Profit shall not be included as a cost element.   Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include (1) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; (2) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements;   (Note:  just put in-kind contribution prior to cash, hoping to send a message to potential offerors)   and (3) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash or in-kind contribution in the future.  Affirmative, signed agreement s are required from outside sources of cash.  Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the sources of the offeror's cost share so that the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources may make a determination.  For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort?  What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any required to support these activities.  The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort that is not covered by cost sharing The costs incurred and work performed by any DOD or national laboratory "partneri ng" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement.  Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made.   D. PROPOSAL PAGE FORMATS All proposals should be printed such that pages are single-sided, with no more than fifty-five (55) lines per page.  Use 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8 1/2" x 11") paper or A4 metric paper.

Evaluation Criteria and the Basis for Award - The Coast Guard will conduct a best value tradeoff process to determine a single offeror for this Effort.  In so doing, the Government may award to other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal.  The Coast Guard's evaluation of Offerors' proposals will be based upon a complete assessment of the following:  Understanding of the performance work statement requirements.  Each Offeror's Proposal will be evaluated to determine whether all requirements of the PWS were addressed.  Proposed technical approach, ability to meet required delivery dates; program management and organization; key personnel qualifications; and compliance with requirements.  Past Performance - Your company's past performance will be evaluated under existing and prior contracts for similar products and services.  The Government will focus on the offeror's performance and information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the procurement under consideration.  Sources other than those identified by your company in your proposal may also be contacted/accessed by the Government, with the information received/retrieved by the Government for use in the evaluation of your company's past performance.  Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria - Demonstrated understanding of PWS requirements is the most important non-cost factor.  Other non-cost factors are of equal importance.  When combined, the non-cost factors are significantly more important than evaluated price.  However, the cost must be determined fair and reasonable and will therefore be reviewed for reasonableness.  To receive a copy of the Performance Work Statement for this requirement you may either download the attachment, or send an e-mail request (with the solicitation number on the subject line) to ybell@comdt.uscg.mil not later than December 18, 2002.

<ARCHDATE>02282004
<CONTACT>Delores Bryant Contracting Officer 2023662660     delores.bryant@marad.dot.gov;
<DESC>Statement of Work Provide technical support services for a feasibility design study of a new icebreaking research vessel capable of operation in the ice-covered waters and open oceans of Antarctica.   An initial set of science and operational requirements currently exist.  They include, among others, the need to conduct acoustic profiling and bottom mapping during icebreaking, the towing of nets and instruments from the stern during icebreaking and the ability to conduct Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) operations and geotechnical drilling from a moon pool.  In addition to these requirements, the vessel should be acoustically quiet, have reduced air emissions from diesel engines and incinerator operations, have double hull protection, as well as enhanced icebreaking capabilities.      These requirements need to be translated into design criteria and several special studies may need to be performed to properly understand the full implications of certain requirements on the vessel design and cost.  Of significance is the need to develop bow and stern forms that satisfy the above requirements and reflect suitable ice management around the hull to ensure the proper functioning of scientific sensors and equipment. Additionally, the feasibility design shall incorporate applicable U.S. and international rules and regulations, including classification society, that govern the design and construction of vessels for Antarctic operations.  A preliminary cost estimate is also to be developed.  Deliverables include copies of reports or special studies that were conducted, vessel plans and characteristics and a design history notebook.  The effort will take into consideration the design and operational experience gained by existing U.S. and foreign vessels engaged in polar research.  As a result, it is important that the technical support service contractor have prior experience in the design and operation of research vessels in the ice covered waters of the polar regions, preferably the Antarctic, and this will be considered an important factor in evaluating responses.  Resumes of the principals that will be used on the project need to be submitted. A firm, fixed price bid is sought for the above Statement of Work. The Award for the above technical support services will be based on Best Value to the Government. NOTE: The above effort may lead to a competitive solicitation by the Government to U.S. industry for the contract and detailed design and construction of the vessel.  The Contractor conducting the above Government study will be excluded from participation or teaming with other industrial firms or organizations for that competitive design and construction effort.

These kits will provide guided-weapon capability for a modified warhead, the BLU-113 P3I, which will be procured separately. Raytheon Company is the current GBU-28 B/B prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design of the GBU-28 B/B weapon system and integration of the weapon with the aircraft platforms, the B-2 and the F-15E. Raytheon was not required to furnish a technical data package to the System Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available to interested sources to aid in accomplishment of the GBU-28 integration with the BLU-113 P3I warhead or the aircraft platforms, or production of the GBU-28 guidance and tail kits. The scope of the effort shall include evaluation and assessment of the BLU-113 P3I throughout design, development and test to ensure interoperability with the GBU-28 B/B kits and to minimize SEEK EAGLE certification costs. This effort includes hardware modifications to the GBU-28 B/B to accommodate a modified nose shape, a slightly longer BLU-113 with slightly increased diameter, reduced cost telemetry kit redesign, future in-flight fuze reprogramming capability and the production of up to 350 guidance and tail kits.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. However, for those interested in this acquisition, request the complete performanced-based Statement of Work (PBSOW). The Request For Quotation (RFQ) Number is NAMA-03-Q-0007. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 512191 and the Small Business Size Standard is $25 Million. All responsible small business sources may submit a quote that will be considered by NARA. The purchase order will be for a period of one year (12 months). CLIN 0001 Lot prices for all U. S. Air Force 12" analog Videodisc platter images and conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0001AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0001AB 800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor. Note: The actual conversion project will be to convert the images to either CLIN 0001AA or CLIN 0001AB which will be determined by NARA based on the quotes received. The delivery date will be six months after contract award. Place of delivery and acceptance will be National Archives and Records Administration, Special Media Archives Division (NWCS-S), Room 5360, 3301 Metzerott Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, f.o.b. destination.CLIN 0002 Other Direct Costs. The following CLINs are Optional and may or may not be exercised by NARA during the period of performance. CLIN 0003 Lot prices for all U. S. Forest Service 12" analog Videodisc platter images and conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0003AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0003AB 800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor. Note: The actual conversion project will be to convert the images to either CLIN 0003AA or CLIN 0003AB which will be determined by NARA based on the quotes received. The delivery date will be six months after the option is exercised. CLIN 0004 Other Direct Costs. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award a purchase order for Analog Videodisc Image Conversion to Digital Format. The Contractor must convert an estimated 152,857 U. S. Air Force analog images, currently stored on 3 sides of two 12" analog videodisk platters, from the holdings of the Still Picture LICON of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA-NWCS-Stills). The analog videodisk images to be digitized are finding aids for the prints, negatives and positives in Record Group 342, Records of USAF Commands, Activities and Organizations, Series FH. The analog images are divided among several segments covering different historical periods. The finding aid databases that track the images on the videodiscs and allow for subject and item-level access to specific images are currently in MS Access97.  All the functionality that now exists for those databases must be preserved.  The databases delivered to NARA must remain in MS Access97.  There are three databases: USAFMAIN, AFCOLOR, and USAFCAPS. A preliminary analysis of the three databases undertaken by NARA and the fields they contain is attached to this PBSOW.  The Contractor must undertake its own analysis to make sure that it has a thorough knowledge of what each database contains, what fields are in the databases, and what type of information is in each field.  Of the three databases, the USAFMAIN is the most used database. This database is currently used to convert the videodisk side and image numbers assigned by the creator of the discs and databases, to USAF original negative numbers.  Many researchers who contact NARA seeking copies of USAF images, have seen the images on a videodisk, and only have the videodisk location numbers to identify the image(s) that they want copied.  However, the USAF Negative numbers are required to retrieve the original negatives or prints for making copies.  Therefore, reproductions cannot be made until NARA is able to determine the original negative number from the corresponding videodisk location number in the database.  This prime functionality must be maintained and enhanced to allow NARA or its researchers to locate the USAF negative number or the videodisc image number on the DVD+R.  (See Attachment 1to the PBSOW for definitions) When a user provides any one of the three numbers (USAF, Videodisk or DVD+R), the database modified by the Contractor must be able to retrieve the two other corresponding numbers.  For example, if a user provides the videodisk number, the modified database must be able to retrieve and display the corresponding USAF negative number and the image number on the DVD+R. The Contractor must convert an estimated 47,801 U. S. Forest Service analog images, currently stored on one-side of one 12" analog videodisc platter, from the holdings of the Still Picture LICON of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA-NWCS-Stills). The analog videodisc images to be digitized are finding aids for the negatives and positives in Record Group 95 (Records of USFS), Series G (General browsing file).  The analog images are divided among several subject categories. Each of the Title Frames was shot 4-5 times, in order for them to show up when scanning the videodisk at high speeds.  These multiple frame entries will be maintained during the conversion project. In addition, the USFS videodisc has many blank frames, which will be left in during this process as well. The database associated with this disc is currently non-useable.  The database was created in C-Quest Photo Finder, a DOS application.  The database was backed up by the National Agricultural Library staff utilizing a MS-DOS Backup.com application in October of 1992 onto 4-5.25" floppy disks for the Dictionary Files, and 16-5.25" floppy disks with Names Data Files.  NARA has the C-Quest application disk, but requires that these floppy disks be restored with an appropriate RESTORE.COM application, in order to utilize the files on the floppies.  Once the C-quest database can be reconstructed, NARA must be able to export the caption data to an ASCII delimited file, and then import the data into a MS-ACCESS97 database.  This database will then need to be modified to reflect the DVD+R disc and file name for each of the included digital files. The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price purchase order. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition as well as any addenda to the provision. Note: Offerors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items also applies. The following evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, will be used in awarding the acquisition: (1) past performance and (2) technical capability (subfactors are procedures, equipment availability, and technical personnel expertise/experience) as compared to price. Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered. The Offeror should include a completed copy of Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items with its quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, with the previously referenced PBSOW as its addendum, applies to this acquisition. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Paragraph (b) of this clause incorporates by reference the following FAR clauses: 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Viet Nam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Viet Nam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.225-1 Buy American Act Supplies, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is conducting a national building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.  More information about NIST's investigation may be found at the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov.  NIST intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) to provide services under Project 7, Occupant Behavior, Egress, and Emergency Communications.  Specific information for Project 7, may be found by following this link to the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov/media/WTCplan_new.htm#proj7.  

The objective of this requirement is to provide a data set that includes selected publicly available published first-person accounts of the WTC evacuation.  This data set includes approximately 500 existing accounts collected by the NFPA and the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) since September 11, 2001, along with a matrix of encoding variables that captures important incident details for each account.  The NFPA will enhance this existing data set to include additional accounts to be supplied by NIST and additional factors of interest to the investigation of the WTC evacuation on September 11, 2001.  The NFPA is uniquely qualified to perform this effort for three reasons:  1) The NFPA is a nonprofit organization specifically chartered to reduce the worldwide burden of fire and other hazards on the quality of life by providing and advocating scientifically-based consensus codes and standards, research, training and education. 2) Part of their charter includes investigations of technically significant fire incidents and fire data analysis.  3) The NFPA has spent more than one year developing their existing database, which would not be publicly available to other sources for this contract.  

The Government anticipates the award of a commercial firm-fixed price purchase order on or about March 17, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within 
the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) for Multi-Sector projects.

The Contractor would have three goals: 1) to survey the Kosovo economy, focusing on the aviation, telecommunications and roads sectors, with the goal of identifying potential USTDA investments; 2) to perform standard due diligence on any projects identified; and 3) to prepare a profile of Kosovo for the Europe region, which highlights sectors and projects to be watched for their future potential as USTDA investments.  This will include projects in the environmental, wastewater, mining, and manufacturing sectors.

The Contractor will be required to have experts in the aviation and telecommunications sectors, as well as a generalist capable of looking at projects in a variety of sectors.  They would be asked to focus on the development of Terms of Reference (TOR) for projects in Kosovo, propose budgets, explore options for financing the projects, evaluate the potential for U.S. exports, examine any potential environmental impacts, and analyze the possible impact on U.S. labor.  The Contractor is required to have a road project consultant capable of reviewing the Durres Morine road project; however, the road project consultant will not be required to travel.

It will be critical that the Contractor meet with Kosovo Government officials, UNMIK and representatives from all of the major financial institutions active in Kosovo.

In addition to identifying these and other potential USTDA projects, the Contractor will also be required to provide an overview of the Kosovo investment climate as it relates to USTDA's future interest in the province.  It should include projects in the environmental, wastewater, mining and manufacturing sectors that USTDA should monitor for their future potential.   The team should also propose any additional DMs that should be sent to Kosovo.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $45,000.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) advances economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing and middle income countries. The agency funds various forms of technical assistance, feasibility studies, training, orientation visits and business workshops that support the development of a modern infrastructure and a fair and open trading environment.



USTDA's strategic use of foreign assistance funds to support sound investment policy and decision-making in host countries creates an enabling environment for trade, investment and sustainable economic development. Operating at the nexus of foreign policy and commerce, USTDA is uniquely positioned to work with U.S. firms and host countries in achieving the agency's trade and development goals.  In carrying out its mission, USTDA gives emphasis to economic sectors that may benefit from U.S. exports of goods and services.

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to set aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: Small business concerns for purposes of USTDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for USTDA's purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern with an annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, Offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The SOW defines hardware requirements intended to maximize the portability of the existing CHS-2 mission software to CHS-3 products with minimum or no breakage. The contractor will be required to provide world wide technical assistance and support ser vices, technical assistance to address CHS-3 integration problems, equipment installation, CHS-3 software development, software and hardware maintenance, material fielding support, and test support.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), will make available a request for proposal (RFP) to interested offerors with the ability to serve as a Clinical Center (CC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Primary emphases will be on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive, individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of CCs; a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-09; a Radiology Center (RC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-10; and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-11.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to read the RFPs for all of these components of the LTRC to better understand the overall structure and function of the Consortium.  CCs, will recruit and enroll specimen donors; perform clinical testing of subjects; extract data from the patients? medical records; obtain lung tissues and other specimens and perform initial processing of these specimens and transmit clinical data, computed tomographic (CT) image data, and biological specimens to appropriate centers of the LTRC.  CCs will provide reports of any radiographic or pathological abnormalities noted by the RC and/or TC to the donor subjects? primary care physicians.  In addition, each CC will perform hypothesis-oriented, tissue-based research, using LTRC specimens, that addresses pathogenetic mechanisms of COPD and/or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication. ******This is not a RFP and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this notice.  It is anticipated that  RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-08, Lung Tissue Research Consortium: Clinical Centers, will be available on or fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This modification is issued to add the response date.

This is a sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering a purchase of 10,000 PSIG Pneumatic Deadweight Gauge (PDG).  The anticipated quantity is six (6) each of 10,000 PSIG Pneumatic Deadweight Gauge (PDG). This is a gas pressure system consisting of a pneumatic deadweight pressure gauge with a piston /cylinder module, a 35 kg mass set, gas booster,  gas pressure controller and basic software for assisting in pressuure generation, control, and measurement.  The deadweight gauge is semi-automated with on-board sensors to generate gas pressures accurately. The gas booster operates off shop air and the deadweight gage uses bottled gas, (nitrogen), to generate pressure. The system operates directly in gas without liquid/gas separators.  The deadweight gauge is a primary pressure standard capable of generating gas pressure 300 to 10,000 psig within +/-0.004% uncertainty. Absolute pressure is generated by addition of atmospheric pressure. Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business.   (2) indicate if they are a small disadvantaged or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (3) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures.  (4) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess your firm?s capabilities. (5) Provide Point of contact and assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.
A GSA schedule acquisition is anticipated.
This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. At this time, no solicitation exists. Submit all responses to this notice to the point of contact listed below.  All responses/questions should be submitted to Glenna Pound Contracting officer via e-mail at Glenna.Pound@afmetcal.af.mil or by Fax  at 740-788-5157 or mail to 813 Irving-wick Dr W Heath Oh 43056-6116 if e-mail is not possible.

<CONTACT>Regina Blair, 312-353-6400, Ext. 1702
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Chicago District is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that currently possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience necessary to meet the design criteria for the McCook Reservoir Mixing System. THIS is a sources sought for planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost in curred for their participation in this survey.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.  BACKGROUND: The reservoir will be operated as a facultative pond.  Mixing will only be used to resuspend the sediments at the bottom o f the reservoir, and the zone of mixing influence only needs to be approximately 10’ deep.  The purpose of mixing the bottom 10’ is to facilitate sediment removal when the reservoir is gravity drained via a bottom outlet.  Sediment will be resuspended and gravity drained while the reservoir is still full, throughout the entire range of water depths.  (The mixed layer will have 20 to 240’ of water above it.)  ·	Expected water depth range = 30’ to 250’.   ·	The mixers would be used to remove the sediments with the entire range of water depth still above the mixing zone.  Above the 10’ mixing zone, it is desired that the water have very low (near zero) velocity so that mixing with the upper water column is m inimized.  ·	A mixing system for Stage 1 of the reservoir is the current focus.  Stage 1 is separated from Stage 2 and from the sump area by weirs that are approximately 150’ high. A plan and profile of the McCook Reservoir is available by contacting Dr. Jennifer Mil ler at (312) 846-5502.   ·	Maximum depth of solids layer at bottom of reservoir = 36” of material with a water content of 99%  ·	Average dry density of solids = 1.68 g/mL ·	Bottom slope of reservoir =  (a maximum of ) 1% toward the outlet. ·	Reservoir will contain water approximately 10% of the time, and will be dry (and exposed to the elements) the remainder of the time. ·	The mixer design could have a variable number of mixers for the variable water depth, but the overall design must address both low water and high water conditions.  PLEASE SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FOR THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCENARIO: 1.	The number and layout of mixers or jets, including any auxillary pumps or other equipment, and including the space requirements of any equipment that would be located outside the reservoir. 2.	Technical data/description for the proposed equipment, including the horsepower rating. 3.	The total energy input that would be provided. 4.	A general description of the type of controls used for the system. 5.	A general description of the anchors or supports for the mixers or jets. 6.	Any special considerations or equipment that would be needed for the system to operate year-round, and for the equipment to withstand year-round exposure to weather conditions in an empty (completely dewatered) reservoir. 7.	Maintenance requirements for the equipment, including the equipment life, maintenance and replacement frequency, and replacement costs.  8.	An estimated cost for the system, broken down into construction cost and O&M costs, assuming a 20 year life for the system.  ALL CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS are due to Regina Blair and Dr. Jennifer Miller prior to the close of business on 30 April 2003, via email or fax.  Ms. Blair’s email address is: regina.g.blair@lrc02.usace.army.mil and Dr. Miller’s email address is: Jennifer.mi ller@lrc02.usace.army.mil. FAX TO: (312) 886-5475, ATTN: Regina Blair.

<RESPDATE>031403
<CONTACT>John Pfender 812-854-5198
<DESC>The Navy, on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program is issuing this Request for Information (RFI). SOPMOD is presently conducting a market survey. Sources are sought that can provide Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non Developmental Items (NDI). NDI include items that are developed but not yet in production, but can reasonably be expected to be in the status of production-ready articles for comparative testing on or about February of 2004. COTS/NDI information is sought for a Lightweight Machine Gun Muzzle Brake and Suppressors (LMGMBS) for small arms in 5.56mm and 7.62mm to meet the operational requirements of USSOCOM Special Operations combatants. This RFI is to explore industry ability to supply a coordinated modular family of complimentary muzzle brake/suppressors. The SOPMOD Program is interested in exp loring COTS/NDI extended life, expanded application, high-endurance lightweight machine gun suppressors that demonstrate noteworthy capabilities. The LMGMBS will correct the current operational shortfall of suppressors that are optimized for use with current 5.56mm and 7.62mm lightweight machine guns. Sought are improvements in materials, manufacturing process, high endurance coatings, and other unknown technologies that yield extended performance suppressor life to a threshold of 15,000 rounds with an objective of 30,000 rounds under various firing schedules. Suppressor characteristics sought are: length10 - 6.6inches, weight 32 - 24 ounces, diameter 2 -1.5 inches, sound reduction 20-28dB, up to a 2.5 MOA zero shift when fitted to gun, with minor or no loss in instrumental accuracy, endurance to failure under harsh firing schedules approximately 10,000 rounds, and approximatel y 500 rounds under continuous belt-fed full automatic fire. While the SOPMOD program objective seeks to include the minimum number of muzzle brake/suppressor variants requisite to the applications, preliminary market studies indicate that it may be necessary to study several specialized variants. Lightweight Machine Gun Muzzle Brakes and Suppressors are sought that may or may not require different versions of sound suppressors for use on both 5.56mm and 7.62mm machineguns. Market survey information must be received NLT 14 March 03. The vendor response to this market survey must include the following information: 1.) Technical description of product, to include photographs (electronic photograph preferred). 2.) Current users/customers of the product, if any. 3.) Contact information for current users/customers, if any. 4.) Test qualification history of product, if any. 5.) Year 2 003 and 2004, cost and delivery schedule for 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 units. 6.) Industry comments on the feasibility of the performance parameters and system descriptions noted above. If item is of foreign origin, vendors must include information on local government plans for procurement and local government/military contract information, if any. The government may be interested in purchasing product samples of certain LMGMBS. This notice is related to, but not a part of,  solicitation N00164-02-R-0065 in that it seeks to compare COTS/NDI solutions to ongoing developmental efforts at some future date.  This notice does not constitute an invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the government/SOPMOD Program to procure subject material.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  The contracting officer for this contemplated actio n is Mr. John Pfender, telephone (812)854-5198, email pfender_j@crane.navy.mil.   The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information alone or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.


Requested Response:  

Parties interested in providing pricing information for past conservation technical services need to respond by accessing the TspCost Web page on the internet.  The web address is http://tspcost.sc.egov.usda.gov/  or link from http://sc.egov.usda.gov Information and instructions for populating the database are shown there.

Please submit questions about this notice by sending an email message to: edward.biggers@usda.gov.  Questions may also be sent by U.S. mail to: Edward M. Biggers, Jr., Director-Management Services Division, Room 5221-S, 1400 Independence Avenue., SW, Washington, DC 20250.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis. This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than March 28, 2003.  NASA/MSFC is seeking ideas and information from potential offerors on the development of chemical propulsion technologies. MSFC’s particular interest is information or ideas that address the challenges and issues that advance these technologies from their current state to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. This request is not for information concerning flight demonstrations, technologies beyond TRL 6 or at development stages less than TRL 3. It is requested that the potential offeror provide a self-assessment of performance, schedule, and system goals for the chemical propulsion technology. Research conducted by the In-Space Propulsion Investment Area is at the forefront of NASA's efforts to seek new means of enabling faster and more cost efficient missions to the outer planets. Advanced propulsion technologies are being developed to contend with NASA's unique challenges of enabling missions with fast access throughout the solar system and the ability to rendezvous with, orbit and conduct in situ exploration of planets, satellites and small bodies. The sought information is for the advanced chemical propulsion technology area as follows:	Chemical propulsion systems have historically been baseline for primary propulsion and other phases of planetary missions. Advanced storable propellants and/or advanced thrusters, with higher Isp than current systems, may offer significant performance improvements benefits for a range of aggressive planetary missions. Cryogenic propellants may offer similar improvements. The challenges associated with cryogenic propellant utilization include the control of propellant boil-off so that the system is not penalized by the additional propellant mass required to accommodate typical boil-off conditions. Lightweight or optimized components, resulting in improved propellant system propellant mass fraction, also may offer significant improvements. Only United States companies/citizens are requested to respond to this announcement. Interested parties should submit information not to exceed three pages (per technology area) and a maximum of two resumes (not to exceed two pages each). The format is at the discretion of the potential offeror. All proprietary information should be marked. Any responses, questions, comments, ideas and/or information regarding this announcement should be directed to the Marlyce R. Alexander via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission. In responding, please reference RFI-8-1500303. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.	 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?group=C&pin=62   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering a purchase of 9610 Vibration Calibration System Software.  The anticipated quantity is twenty nine (29)each of 9610 Vibration Calibration System Software. The Bruel and Kjaer 9610 Vibration Transducer Calibration System calibrates accelerometers and velocity pick-ups that are used on aircraft and jet engine test stands.  This new buy is to update and enhance the software on the original system to allow calibration at discrete frequency points.  The original system used a DOS operating system on an obsolete IBM 286 computer.  The new software will run on a PMEL supplied PC with MS Windows and will follow the flow of the old software with some new features.  This Bruel and Kjaer 9610 Vibration Transducer Calibration System is an automated system that calibrates a wide variety of accelerometers and velocity pick-offs that are in the USAF inventory. The automated software is a menu driven, user friendly program that minimizes the number of manual operations required by the user.   The 9610 Vibration Transducer Calibration System is based on an improved FFT back-to-back comparison calibration method (calibration by substitution).  The sensitivities of two transducers, one a reference, the other a DUT, are compared using a dual-channel signal analyzer to measure the ratio of their outputs.  The dual channel analyzer also generates the random noise signal supplied to two different shakers.  Calibration by substitution involves two measurements.  The reference measurement, in which a working standard accelerometer is calibrated against a standard reference accelerometer, is stored.  Then a DUT is calibrated against the working standard, producing a frequency response function, which is compared to the stored measurement.  The 9610s were procured in the late 1980's and are in need of updating. This acquisition will mainly consist of operating software plus some new features that were not present in the existing model.  The new software shall emulate the old software and shall be able to run the original instrumentation that came with the 9610.  AFMETCAL plans to use one of the lab?s newer controllers to install and run the new software.   We do not plan on procuring another computer/controller.  Furthermore, a manual or real time calibration showing outputs from both reference standard and DUT, would be beneficial in trouble shooting and discrete frequency calibration of a transducer. Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business.   (2) indicate if they are a small disadvantaged or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (3) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures.

<SUBJECT>H -- Quality Metrics Pilot
<DESC>The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intents to engage in a limited pilot project with M-CAM under FAR 6.302-1 for the following:  

Patent application filings have increased dramatically throughout the world.  Technology has become increasingly complex, and demands from customers for higher quality products and services have escalated.  In response to these demands, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) developed the 21st Century Strategic Plan.  The Strategic Plan is an aggressive and far-reaching five-year plan that reflects both a thorough internal process review and a systematic attempt to incorporate the best thinking of our stakeholders.  The Strategic Plan identifies a number of efforts that will improve the quality of our products, further expand our e-government objectives, and strengthen our ability to be one of the most efficient intellectual property organizations in the world.

The USPTO recognizes that a robust quality assurance program is critical to maintaining the public?s desired level of patent product quality.  The public?s interest in quality has been repeatedly and strongly voiced.  Accordingly, improving patent quality is a major objective of the Strategic Plan.  To reach our goals, the USPTO has initiated an improved Quality Assurance Program.  The improved program integrates past quality review programs into a single integrated Quality Assurance Program for the USPTO, expands the quality review of work products, and improves the connection between the results of the review and subsequent training requirements.

Prior to the Strategic Plan, the USTPO established its Office of Patent Quality Review (OPQR) end-checking process more than 25 years ago.  While the randomly sampled OPQR measures are statistically valid, they have proven difficult to use when building training programs.  Particularly difficult has been the development of training programs to help individual examiners whose needs do not coincide with the Technology Center averages determined by OPQR statistical measures.  Further, OPQR is a stand-alone organization at the end of the examination pipeline.  This has made it difficult to modify the OPQR process to better connect their quality measurements into training program development.

Not long ago, the USPTO established an In-Process Review (IPR) of examiners? work products using a review standard based upon applicant/attorney feedback.  The Quality Assurance Examiners (QASs) for each Technology Center (TC) reviewed a random sample of completed Office actions per fiscal year.  A further sample from the reviewed pool was used for follow up with applicant?s representative to get their judgment of the quality.  The results of the random sample were used to determine general TC-wide training needs from which the QASs develop training courses. The USPTO is currently expanding the IPRs of examiners? workproducts as part of the improved Quality Assurance Program.

Current USPTO quality reviews generate organizational measures, but do not provide measures that can be used to identify individual quality performance levels and address the needs of an individual examiner.  The major goal of the expanded quality review program under the Strategic Plan is to identify quality trends and individual examiners with significant quality concerns and to provide sufficient help to address those concerns.  Employing the applicant/attorney based review standards of our prior In-Process Review and adding measures of indicia of quality performance the reviews under the Strategic plan will provide a robust field of feedback at the organizational and individual quality performance level.

The USPTO is interested in obtaining assistance with defining the quality performance metrics and indicators associated with the In-Process Review (IPR) Program, on a limited pilot basis. Particularly, the USPTO is interested in developing objective quality metrics and indicators at the organizational level of quality performance based upon the data collected during the In-Process Reviews. This pilot would be used to identify the critical objective data points and verify the link of performance in these areas to overall patent examination quality at the organizational level.  Additionally, these indicators and the data collected during IPRs will flow into numerous processes within the Patents organization including:

?	Training development.
?	Examiner certification and re-certification.
?	Annual performance appraisals.
?	Quality award determination.
?	Selection of Supervisory Patent Examiners, QASs, and Examiner Trainers.
?	Calculation of Technology Center quality measurements such as reopening rate.
?	Calculation of overall USPTO quality measurements.

Any responses to fulfill the above stated requirements can be submitted on a cost or no-cost basis. Provide previous product applications and references.  Include any terms, conditions, disclaimers, and/or limitations connected with the response.

All questions regarding this notice should be submitted to Janet Carlson, via e-mail at Janet.Carlson@uspto.gov, or via telephone at 703/305-8219.  The deadline for submitting responses is 5:00 pm EST, March 10, 2003.

<SUBJECT>Joint Tactical Radio System-Fixed Maritime (Cluster III)
<DESC>Commerce Business Daily Notice of Modified Advisory Multi-Step Process and Postponement of Industry Day for Joint Tactical Radio System ? Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3.  IT ALSO INCLUDES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE JTRS M/F. POC:  Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, Contracting Officer, (e-mail address: mark.lopez@navy.mil); commercial telephone (619) 524-7168. DESCRIPTION: This CBD announcement is to publicize postponement of the previously planned JTRS-M/F (Cluster 3) Industry Day, scheduled for 11-13 March 2003.  A new date and time for this Industry Day is to be determined and will be publicized through a future announcement. Despite the postponement of the JTRS-M/F Industry Day, RFI responses to the previously released CBD announcement (dated February 6, 2003, FBO#0433) will still be evaluated.  As stated in the February 6, 2003 CBD announcement, these RFI responses will allow the government to evaluate and advise the respondents about their potential to be viable competitors IAW FAR 15.202 (i.e. Advisory Multi-Step Process) for the JTRS-M/F system development and procurement. The government will not evaluate submitted information if it only concerns a part of the JTRS-M/F System, e.g. only the radio.  Submittals must address the entire JTRS-M/F system. In addition to the information requested in the February 6, 2003 CBD announcement, Prime System Level potential offerors are requested to provide to the government an additional twenty (20) page limit (total) response addressing the following supplemental areas: S1. The JTRS-M/F program office requires information regarding how to fulfill the JTRS JORD networking requirements.  Describe the approach for incorporating each of the networking performance and management requirements discussed in sections 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 of the System Specification into your proposed JTRS-M/F system.  Address the viability of having this functionality internal to the JTR and if there are any potential impacts to the JPO waveforms (e.g. WNW, Link16, DWTS, etc.).  Discuss the viability for providing a single point of entry for each security enclave through an additional Layer 3 network switch/router that meets US Military data communication network (e.g. the Navy?s ADNS) protocols.  Describe your system implementation of the IP/open system interconnections (OSI) routing services (minimum of OSPF Version 2), multiple OSPF processes, quality of service (QoS), protocol translations (e.g. X25), WAN interface support (e.g. ATM), and PPP services.  Describe your system approach for the implementation of quality of service (QoS) functionality to include QoS configuration and maintenance, signaling, policy and shaping, congestion management, and congestion avoidance into the above-mentioned routers.  Address the viability of also providing Dynamic QoS (DQoS) functionality into the routers. Additional information desired (and not subject to the page limit) by the government for informational purposes is: S2. Modified Cluster 3 Schedule to incorporate networking requirements ? Provide an executive type schedule that portrays the efforts planned in order to deliver the Cluster 3 (as modified by this RFI).  Identify the level of schedule risk associated with the proposed schedule.  In the event the offeror believes the proposed schedule to be of high risk, provide a schedule of low to moderate risk. S3. ROM cost of Delivered baseline Cluster 3 system (as modified by this RFI) ? Provide an estimated production price of a Cluster 3 system for DDG-51 class ship with a breakdown of the major equipment/cost areas. Questions S2 & S3 are for informational purposes only and will not be subject to evaluation.

<DESC>On May 29, 2002, an F-16 U.S. Air Force jet fighter crossing the Tohono O?odham Nation airspace had engine trouble and crashed.  The impact area was sampled for the presence of jet fuel and heavy metals under project NUEX027102 (Oracle Environmental, 15 Oct 02).  One hot spot of JP-8 contamination was identified as well as an ash-laden burn spot contaminated with heavy metals and hydrocarbons.  The depth of the JP-8 contamination is between 6 ? 12 inches and the burn spot?s dimensions are approximately 40 feet in length, 15 feet in width and 1 foot in depth.  This project involves the cleanup of this contamination.  Contaminated soils will be excavated by hand, placed in Supersacks, transported to a staging area and loaded into roll-off containers by helicopter, and then trucked to a landfill for disposal.  The bottom of the excavation will be sampled to ensure cleanup goals have been met. Supersacks will be filled with backfill material at the staging area/borrow pit.  The backfill bags will be transported to the site via helicopter and spread in the excavation by hand.  A final report summarizing field activities and presenting results of the sampling will be written.

"Executive Leadership Development" Seminars

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management is soliciting price quotations to perform the services described in this request for quotations (RFQ).  This procurement is set aside for competition among small businesses only.  The North America Industrial Classification Code (NAIC) is 611430 with a size threshold of 100 or fewer employees for determining if a company is considered small business for purposes of this acquisition. 

The work will consist of three segments:  1)  the design and staffing of two separate and unique one-week long seminars, which are a part of the Executive Leadership Development Seminars (ELDS), and which are to provide leadership training to the Phoenix Area Indian Health Services (PAIHS) to be conducted July 28-August 1, 2003 (session two), and August 18th -22, 2003 (session three),  2)  the delivery of the aforementioned week-long seminars at the Western Management Development Center (WMDC) in Aurora, Colorado (a suburb of Denver), and 3) the evaluation and design improvement of each completed seminar based on WMDC staff and participant feedback.
 
This work will support the delivery of leadership training in the ELDS whose primary mission is to ensure new competencies and fresh perspectives to the current and future leaders in Indian health care settings by developing partnerships with various tribes, universities, foundations and other organizations.  The WMDC plans to conduct the seminars in 2004 and 2005 as well. We expect each seminar will be attended by up to 40 participants from the Indian health services.

Any proposal must cover all three segments.  Partial proposals will not be accepted.

After all proposals have been submitted, the responsible WMDC Associate Director and WMDC Contracting Officer will evaluate the proposals and award a contract for the seminars based on the criteria included in this request for quotation.  Each respondent to this RFQ will be evaluated to determine their ability to meet the primary learning objective of delivering leadership training through to accomplish the mission of the ELDS. A second evaluation criteria will be the price to deliver the work as outlined above.  The technical evaluation results will be significantly more important than price in determining the successful offeror.  The dollar amount of this award will be less than $100,000 . 

Your proposal must be received at the address listed below by close of business, 5:00 pm MST on  Monday, March 24, 2003.  Any proposals received after this time and date may be considered only if the Government determines it is in its best interest to do so.

<DESC>Request For Information and Request for Proposal (RFI / RFP):  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a hardcopy solicitation will not be issued. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is requesting information and proposals seeking potential U.S. sources interested in competing for production, fielding, and sustainment of a Leaflet Delivery System, (LDS), variant materiel solution, referred to as the Wind Supported Air Delivery System (WSADS).  Currently, USSOCOM has a requirement for up to two (2) systems, with a possibility for follow-on requirements up to a total quantity of 74 systems.  The Request For proposal (RFP) Number is: USZA22-03-R-0022.  Because of program schedule, this is a combined synopsis, request for information from industry, and solicitation seeking proposals on qualified candidate technology that will meet the performance specifications of the WSADS.  We seek frank information and proposals from each respondent on how your unique approach might meet the needs of the program (see below).   Although we intend to make use of information you submit to further shape this acquisition, we will not release any information about your approach that might compromise your competitive posture or proprietary information.  USSOCOM desires a materiel solution to address the Psychological Operations (PSYOP) forces requirement to accurately deliver (PSYOP) products (leaflets) to a variety of targets and threat areas with minimal risk to aircrews/aircraft/delivery system.  The desired solution must be useable across the spectrum of conflict and during peacetime operations. Candidate systems must be able to transport leaflets via autonomous flight to a designated release point (LAT/LONG at specific altitude and Grid Coordinates).  The system must also monitor wind conditions while in flight and modify calculations, if needed, to solve for proper release point within the indicated tolerances; automatically release the leaflet cargo; and proceed to a predetermined destination for recovery.  Interested parties can obtain a copy of the USSOCOM WSADS Performance Specification LDS-WSADS-OOO2, dated 1 September 2000 by emailing a request to duvalm@socom.mil.  This announcement is an RFI / RFP seeking responses from potential sources interested in competing for production, fielding, and sustainment of the WSADS LDS variant starting in late April/May 2003 timeframe.  There are no development funds available and the proposed system must be COTS having completed necessary safety assessment/analysis reporting and have demonstrated capability for US military air-drop and ground-launch employment.   Responses shall identify the respondent, describe proposed applicable technology relevant to the LDS requirement and WSADS performance specification, and outline past organizational experience with autonomous precision guided airborne delivery systems.  Responses to this notice are due no later than 28 March, 2003.  Based upon an assessment of the responses to this RFI / RFP, it is the intention of the LDS Program Manager to enter production within 180 days after deadline for response to this RFI/RFP.
