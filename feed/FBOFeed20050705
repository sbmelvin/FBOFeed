<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a purchase order to the University of Minnesota for “MPO/State DOT Travel Survey Archive”. Under the BTS grant,  investigators formally contacted the 50 largest Metropolitan Planning Organizations. Several paper reports were received and were digitized and posted to the webpage.  Presently there are over 60 surveys from 28 metro areas and states together with documentation and reports available on the project web page. There are nearly 60 different data formats making tabulations from each survey or a combination of surveys very difficult. The main objective of the project is to organize the data into a standard format to allow for easy queries.  The project will use the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)  a metadata  standard used for documenting datasets developed in European and North American data archives, libraries and official statistics agencies. The “Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive” was funded by the United States Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 2003 to 2004 (funding expires in mid-2004) under the “BTS research grants” program.  It is now housed at the University of Minnesota at http://www.surveyarchive.org).  This project is a continuation of the BTS project.  This travel survey archive is the only place in the United States where this work has occurred.  Moving it to another location would require extensive effort and would result in higher costs and delays due to loss of experience and familiarity with the archived datasets.  No other known source possesses the knowledge required to successfully provide this service. This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about June 7th, 2005.

<DESC>The work shall consist of furnishing all plant, labor, equipment, materials and supervision to complete construction work for Project PQWY 02-1050, INSTALL STORM WATER CATCH BASINS, AIRCRAFT RAMPS, at McChord AFB Washington. Following is a brief summary of the project and is provided solely for the purpose of revealing the general nature of the work involved. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The intent of this project is to provide catch basin structures that can be closed during aircraft deicing operations to prevent the flow of liquid deicing fluid into the storm water drainage system. When deicing fluids are not present the catch basin will need to open to allow storm water to flow into the existing storm sewer system. There are forty-six catch basins identified on the following attachments that will need to have steel structures fabricated and installed. Catch Basins will need to be measured prior to fabrication to ensure proper fit. There may be minor differences for each catch basin inlet, i.e. single or double grate with one or two valves. Airfield pavement will not be removed or damaged during construction. The structures will be cast specifically for each catch basin and during installation they will be set into the catch basins and properly sealed to the surrounding concrete or asphalt pavement to prevent leaks. The catch basin inserts must be designed and installed so that they may be easily opened and closed by aircraft maintenance personnel. The applicable NAICS Code is 237110 with a small business size standard of $17.0 Million. The magnitude of construction is between $100,000 and 250,000.

It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the continuation of the Financial and Administrative Systems Support (FASS) services to provide real-time operations and sustaining support to the Financial Management, Human Resources, Procurement and Center Operation areas.  It includes user support and operation and sustaining engineering activities for 1) Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) formerly the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP), the Electronic Government (e-Gov)and other administrative systems such as time and attendence and budget modules implemented at JSC; 2) legacy applications operating at JSC; 3) pre-implementation planning and implementation support for the transition to future IEM and e-Gov modules and 4) development and sustaining engineering of new JSC unique administrative systems to support Center Management requirements. IEMP is an Agency-wide initiative designed to moderize NASA's financial systems and processes. NASA/JSC intends to acquire the services from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The 3-year base period of performance of the contract will be from August 25, 2006 through August 24, 2009 with two 1-year options for extensions of services through August 24, 2011. The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition under Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as contemplated by the provision of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), which states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services required by the Agency may be deemed to be available from one original source in the case of a follow-on contract, for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The provision also states that this exception is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.  The original JOFOC for the current FASS contract was approved by the JSC Competition Advocate of July 16, 2001. This JOFOC determined that, pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), continued support by SAIC was essential to prevent a lapse in the real-time operations and sustaining support services to JSC.  SAIC has developed most of the existing legacy systems during the past eight years and acquired a unique level of expertise and corporate knowledge necessary to provide the required program support that is currently not available from any other source. SAIC’s knowledge of the NASA-unique processes involved with the Federalized SAP version and its knowledge of our legacy systems will be critical to JSC during the aggressive Agency mandated implementation schedule of new IEMP and e-Gov modules during the next six years.  SAIC has a unique level of expertise and corporate knowledge in-place, including the documentation, facilities, and the personnel required to support the IEMP and e-Gov modules and the legacy applications currently utilized by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Human Resources (HR), Office of Procurement (BA)  and Center Operations Directorate (JA).  These qualifications and resources are not available from any other company since many of our legacy systems were developed specifically for JSC by SAIC personnel.  Qualifications include expertise in the data structure, transactional processes, reporting, and information technology of these applications, for both the local JSC and the implemented Agency applications. Due to these combined factors, the resources required for continued operations support for the CFO, HR, BA and JA administrative systems and the Agency-mandated schedule for implementation of the new modules, the services provided for in this contract must be expanded. SAIC’s support has been vital to JSC in dealing with the changing government priorities and new requirements associated with the IEMP and e-Gov implementations.  Their knowledge of our legacy data was instrumental to our success in converting to the SAP financial system.  They have the same level of knowledge for many of the legacy systems that will be converted or interfaced to the Integrated Asset Management (IAM) module.   In addition, their involvement in our implementation of the core financial module of SAP uniquely qualifies them to provide support for our implementation of the IAM module. The increased complexity associated with real-time SAP processing and report generation, and coordination with Headquarters and the IEMP Competency Center at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) have made their technical support and knowledge crucial to our continuing operations.   SAIC recently participated in the Agency consolidation of the NASA Equipment Management System (NEMS) and NASA Supply Management System (NSMS) databases.  SAIC was instrumental, through their knowledge and expertise, in making this happen for JSC.  Although these applications are maintained by MSFC, the local required reports and interfaces are very complex.  SAIC understands the data structure and local interfaces, thus enabling them to aid in rapid recovery from system failures and facilitate the integration of the system with other systems.  In addition, it allows them to respond quickly to non-routine requests for information and provide required user support.  To attempt to make contract changes as we prepare for implementation of IAM may result in our inability to implement on schedule as required by the Agency.	Due to the steep learning curve, a transition at this time would impact our ability to support daily operations without interruption and would further complicate our challenging business processes. SAIC personnel’s knowledge and skill of the Business Warehouse (BW) reporting tool have been instrumental in providing the support our users need to report financial data in a timely manner.	Personnel participated on the Agency implementation team at the Competency Center prior to the implementation of SAP at JSC.  Once we went live, this knowledge of the data in SAP has been invaluable to our users.	In addition, these personnel have taken advanced training in the technical structure of the BW reporting tool, and participated in the Proof of Concept phase for the new BW augmentation tool that will be rolled out to users in FY 2006.  This level of knowledge cannot be duplicated by any other contractor. The Integrated Budget Office Toolbox (IBOT) is a Center-Unique application currently in development by SAIC.   This application is critical to the Program Operating Plan (POP) cycle at JSC.  The POP cycle involves not only the JSC organizations, but also the Shuttle and Space Station Programs located here at JSC.  SAIC’s unique level of knowledge of our data structure, SAP, and the BW has contributed to the development of this state-of-the-art budget and reporting tool. The local JSC interface with the SAP core finance module may require substantial changes due to the PMI2, SVU, and IAM implementations.	Since the contractor developed this interface, the contractor is the only source with the required skills and unique experience to perform this task. SAIC also provides sustaining engineering support for the Human Resources Office (HRO) functions.  Because of the ePayroll integration, all sustaining engineering activities for JSC HRO applications are now the responsibility of FASS.  These applications include the agency-wide NASA Employees Benefits System (NEBS) and NASA Operations Profile System (NOPS).  Other JSC HRO applications added to the list of supported applications for FASS include: Astronaut Selection Support System (ASTRO); Overtime Management System (OMS); Workforce Representation System (WREP); Workforce Tracking System (WTS); Awards System; Employee Emergency Contact System (EECS); JSC Mentoring Program (JMP); Student Tracking System (STS); Training Registration System (TRS); Admin Star; and the Volunteer Support System (VSS).  The incumbent has provided the support necessary to convert these systems to use the data from the e-Gov module implemented in FY2004, the Department of the Interior’s Federal Personnel Payroll System.  Sustaining support requires knowledge of several programming languages and platforms.  This support uniquely qualifies the incumbent to continue the support of these applications. This action is required to ensure JSC's ability to support two critical Agency initiatives: 1) successful implementation of the new NASA IEMP and e-Gov modules and 2) NASA's effort to obtain an unqualified audit opinion of its financial statements. The consistency provided by the developer of the legacy software for these functions can only be provided by SAIC and this consistency is required by the Government to sustain these vital functions. The risk to the Government associated with transitioning a new contractor cannot be accepted at this time due to the criticality of the work effort during the next 5 years.  The Agency currently has the following implementations planned for the contract period: ·  Project Management Information Improvement (PMI2):  This is a joint effort of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and Office of the Chief Engineer (OCE) to implement a new budget structure and technical Work Breakdown Schedule (WBS) to support Earned Value Management.  It will require highly skilled, knowledgeable implementers to ensure that current financial operations and reporting are not compromised.  The implementation will occur in three phases, with the first phase beginning in FY 2005.  SAIC’s knowledge of our current data, data structure, and reporting needs is crucial to JSC’s success in implementing this Agency initiative.  A change in our support contractor during any phase of this implementation would add unreasonable risk to our ability to meet the reporting and processing challenges this change will present to our users.  ·  Contract Management Module (CMM):  The Contract Management Module will provide a comprehensive tool to support contract writing, contract administration, procurement management and data and reporting management materials for NASA. This component will provide detailed and quantitative data to facilitate, economize, and expedite procurement processes.  It will be interfaced to the Core Financial module of SAP.	SAIC’s knowledge of JSC’s current legacy systems, data and interfaces is integral to our ability to successfully implement this system.  This knowledge will be invaluable as we validate the Center data in the new system.	 ·  Federalized SAP Version Upgrade (SVU):  This is a major upgrade to the current Federalized SAP R/3 Financial System. The upgrade impacts both resources and procurement processes, providing budget planning capability and a streamlined year-end closing process that involves greater automation of the process, resulting in shorter cycle time to complete the closing cycle.	Additional benefits include the ability to more efficiently and effectively investigate and resolve errors on contract instruments and the ability to see information by Standard General Level account postings.   SAIC’s knowledge of NASA’s and JSC’s unique processes and the NASA configuration of the SAP software will be critical to our continued operation through this upgrade.  They have the knowledge to provide help desk support, training, and data validation support.	A change in contractors just before go-live would be a major risk to our success in implementing this upgrade. ·  Integrated Asset Management (IAM) Module: NASA's concept of IAM includes the functional areas of Facilities Management, Logistics Management, Aircraft Management, and Environmental Management. NASA uses its Asset Management processes to maintain the stewardship and safety of all real and personal property owned by the Federal Government, and assigned control to the Agency.  NASA controls a wide range of assets such as land, buildings, aircraft, space vehicles, computers, plant equipment, chemicals, supplies, and hazardous waste. Functionality of the IAM component will include financial reporting, physical inventory, maintenance, and liability. As part of the IEMP initiative, NASA re-engineered IAM into four cross-functional business processes: Plan, Acquire, Maintain, and Disposition. These business processes represent the asset life cycle that will be the basis for the IAM system framework's evolution, and incorporate best practices such as Product Life Cycle Management, Supply Chain Management, and Electronic Commerce. Sustaining and stabilization support will be required beyond the implementation date.   The corporate knowledge possessed by key individuals currently on the contract and supporting the JSC Logistics organization software is crucial to our continuing success.  Interruption of support by this contractor during this period would increase the risk to our implementation to an unacceptable level.  ·  e-Travel Module:  this module will replace the current Travel Manager system.   It will include not only the capabilities of the current system, but will also allow employees to complete all phases of their travel, from reservations through the final voucher.  Extensive training and help desk support for all Civil Service personnel who travel will be required for this module.  SAIC personnel understand the current level of knowledge in the civil service workforce and will be instrumental in providing training at the right level for the new system.	Their continued help desk support will be vital to retaining an acceptable level of customer support at JSC. Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks for the IFMP.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Forecast Systems Lab (FSL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with Trimble Navigation, Ltd. for the Trimble NetRS GPS receiver and Zephyr Geodetic Antenna to be used to provide GPS integrated water vapor measurements for the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) as well as other projects including the 2005-06 Texas Air Quality Study, and 2006 Hydrometeorological Testbed. NOAA requires this receiver and antenna for uniformity and consistency across the research networks. NOAA/FSL’s membership in The University Navstar Consortium (UNAVCO) allows the NOAA laboratories to share technology and science-based research with UNAVCO and to purchase GPS receivers at reduced costs from Trimble. 

The NetRS GPS Receivers are dual frequency L2C enabled geodetic receivers designed for high accuracy geodetic and atmospheric measurements made by NOAA research. It uses internet protocol (IP) as the primary communications mechanism. It has flexible data outputs and data logging capabilities. 

The Zephyr Geodetic Antenna is a low cost patch antenna with extremely low multipath, outstanding low elevation tracking and sub-millimeter phase center accuracy required for atmospheric research.

<DESC>Liquid Chromatograph-Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometer (LC-ICP/MS)

This notice replaces the initial notice posted in the morning of  07/05/2005.  Please call 513 487-2049 if you have any questions.

This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 423490.  The specifications for the Liquid Chromatograph-Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometer (LC-ICP/MS) are as follows:   

Specifications

Specifications for LC-ICP-MS System

A Liquid Chromatograph-Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometer (LC-ICP/MS) system is required to be able to separate the elemental species in the ground water samples via a LC and to determine the elemental compositions by an ICP-MS.

1. LC system
A LC system is required to perform the automated sample injection, separation and detection.

1.1 LC Pump
A quaternary pump is required to ensure a pulse-free, stable solvent flow and efficient mixing of mobile phase solutions.  A high-speed proportioning valve and a pre-configured vacuum degasser are required for convenient low-pressure mixing of four solvents and the flexibility in solvent pH choices.  PEEK and/or PTFE tubing are required for the pump head.   A seal wash feature for high salt mobile phases is also required.  Flow range should be from 0.5 to 3 mL/min.  The LC pump should also have a built-in leak and pressure test with graphical presentation of pressure profiles, and a maintenance feedback.  The pump should be housed inside a compartment which can also house a module for two columns and at least four mobile phase solution bottles.  At least four mobile phase solution bottles and the connections tubing are required.

1.2 Autosampler 
An LC autosampler is required to be able to inject a volume from 1 µl to 1000 µl.  The autosampler should also be able to house over 60 sample vials of 1 to 2 ml size.  The injection needle must be made of or coated with inert materials, in order to avoid direct contact of metal needle with samples.

1.3 Detector
The LC system should be equipped with a variable wavelength detector (UV-visible).  The detector should have high sensitivity and low detection limits with low baseline noise and drift.  The detector should also be able to perform realtime chromatographic signal plot. 

2. ICP-MS
An ICP-MS is required to detect the elemental components of the chemical species that are separated and eluted from the LC column at trace and ultra-trace level.


2.1 Samples Introduction, ICP RF Power and Ion Optics 
The sample introduction system must allow the coupling of LC system as a sample introduction source besides the conventional sample introduction.  The ICP RF generator must be a solid-state and have a high coupling efficiency so that reproducible analyses can be achieved through a high temperature and stable plasma.  The sample introduction system should contain a quartz torch and a quartz spray chamber to allow the usage of MicroMist or PEEK MiraMist nebulizer.  The spray chamber should be cooled constantly with materials such as Peltier.  Ion optics should be designed to allow for analyses of high dissolved solids of up to 1000 mg/L of Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Cl.  Proper vent duck kit should be supplied for proper heat and fume ventilation.

2.2 A Reaction Cell
A reaction cell should be equipped with the ICP-MS to allow for simple collision or chemical reaction, so that the polyatomic interferences on critical elements such as arsenic, selenium, chromium can be eliminated.  The reaction cell should not decrease the sensitivity of the above elements more than ten fold, comparing to the results obtained when the reaction cell is not used.  Standard mode (no cell gas) should also be available to maintain a full capability of ICP-MS as a multi-element measurement technique.  A gas purification kit should also be supplied, together with all the fittings and tubing required to connect the reaction cell with the reaction gas.

2.3 ICP-MS Detector 
It is required that the ICP-MS consists of a quadrupole mass analyzer.  All the necessary vacuum pumps, connection tubing, and cable should be provided.  The mass analyzer should be able to quantify elements from Li to U at sub ppb levels.  For elements such as As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Tl, V, and Zn, a detection limit of low ppt level is essential.  The MS must be able to collect data at both pulse counting and analog mode.  A calibration must be allowed to establish between the two data collecting modes.  The dynamic range for quantification of elements should be at least 8 orders of magnitude.  The instrument should also be stable enough for a drift of less than &#61617;10% for continuous calibration check during a ten-hour run.

2.4 Cooling System
A chiller should be supplied to ensure the proper cooling of the ICP-MS.

2.5 PC and Computer Software
A PC must be supplied to be fully capable of performing the task required by the instrument.  A readable-writable CD drive must also be supplied, besides the normal floppy and CD drive.

The instrument must be operated through user-friendly software.  The software must be able to perform control and acquisition of ICP-MS.  The software must also be able to be fully integrated into LC sequence control and data acquisition, such as collecting and analyzing chromatographic data in real-time.  The software must be able to perform advanced peak integration routines, confirmation of target analytes and perform QC check.  A quantitative analysis report should be able to print out automatically in real-time during the sequence, or the data can be manipulated (for example using different integration parameters) and quantified off-line later.  Data must be able to be exported to Excel and manipulated into a different format.

3. LC-ICP-MS Connection Kit
A LC-ICP-MS Connection Kit consists of all the components required to combine the LC with the ICP-MS.  This includes all the necessary fittings, PFA tubing and cables for complete synchronization of the LC and ICP-MS.  A connecting block which allows the column eluent to be directed into the standard nebulizer/spray chamber is also required.  An additional internal standard must be allowed to be added post-column, for continuous point-by-point correction.  

4. Arsenic Speciation Technology
It is preferred that a LC column and eluent menu be provided for arsenic speciation and determination.  The main arsenic species are arsenite, arsenate, monomethyl arsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid.

5. In-house Modification

5.1 Electrical modification
Depending on the instrument purchased, electrical wall plugs with specific configurations have to be installed to accommodate the instrument electrical features.

5.2 UPS System 
A UPS system is required to protect the ICP-MS from an occasional power outage.  The specs of UPS will be provided depending on the type of instrument purchased.  It is suggested that the UPS placed in Lab 305 (through the wall between lab 304 and 305), to minimize the heat depiction into Lab 304.

5.3 Ventilation System
The fume and heat produced by the ICP-MS have to be vented outside the room.  A ventilation modification is also required to accommodate the specific instrumental requirement.  Detailed specs will be provided depending on the type(s) of instrument(s) purchased.

5.4 Reaction Cell Gas
One or more gas cylinder(s) containing helium, hydrogen, or helium-hydrogen mixture, depending on the type(s) of instrument(s) purchased, need to be purchased to supply the reaction cell gas.  The specs will be provided later, for the specific type(s) of instrument(s) purchased.

5.5 Argon Gas 
The existing manifold and tubing connection for argon gas in lab 304 has to be modified so that the new ICP-MS can draw Argon from the same liquid argon tank located outside Lab 304.  

5.6 Gas Regulators
Extra gas regulators, a single stage regulator in front of the instrument argon stream and one or more dual stage regulators (stainless steel, depending on the instrument purchased) for helium/hydrogen in front of the reaction cell needs to be purchased.

6. Lab Space
Based on the relative clean environment required by the ICP-MS instrument, it is suggested that the ICP-MS be placed in Lab 304.

<ARCHDATE>08042005
<CONTACT>SCOTT FOGLE, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (513) 487-2049, Fax (513) 487-2115, Email SFOGLE@EPA.GOV - MICHAEL BRINKMILLER, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone (513) 487-2013, Fax (513) 487-2115, Email brinkmiller.michael@epa.gov
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Applied BioSystems (Applera Corporation) to purchase Microarray Analysis Equipment (high-density microarray scanner and low-density microarray thermocycler/scanner).  

Based on EPA’s knowledge of the Microarray Analysis Equipment, there are features covered in the specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  Minimum Specifications for the Micro Array Equipment (1 & 2) :  Due to the critical needs that exist for the EPA in using human, mouse and rat models in toxicogenomics, the benchmarks for both components of this Microarray Analysis Equipment are based upon microarrays and PCR assays available for these three species. Additional requirements are based on the new equipment complementing our pre-existing Affymetrix equipment (e.g., the GCS3000 scanner), which is capable of processing Affymetrix GeneChips.

1. The high-density microarray scanner must have the ability process DNA microarrays that are catalogued, validated and readily available for purchase.  These human, mouse and rat microarrays must each contain DNA probes specific for a minimum of 25,000 separate genes (i.e., each species microarray must have 25,000 or more probes for human, and 25,000 for mouse, and 25,000 for rat).  These probes must have the ability to detect transcripts from a minimum of 25,000 unique and reasonably annotated genes, based upon either public or private genomic databases (e.g., NCBI, Celera Discovery System, TIGR).  Additionally, the genes interrogated by these microarrays must reasonably complement the data available to the EPA from our existing Affymetrix (GeneChip) systems. Thus the equipment must be able to process microarrays that interrogate greater than 8,000 human genes, greater than 4,000 mouse genes, and greater than 10,000 rat genes, not interrogated by standard catalogued Affymetrix GeneChips.      

2. The low-density microarray thermocycler/scanner must have the ability to run 384 separate PCR reactions simultaneously utilizing a microfluidics or robotics system automating the distribution of reagents and samples into the 384 reactions. Furthermore, the system must be compatible with catalogued and validated DNA primers and probe combinations for quantitative PCR, with a minimum of 100,000 unique, gene-specific assays for each of the three species (human, mouse and rat) for analyzing gene expression. The equipment must be capable of running a minimum of 40,000 assays in the low-density microarray/microfluidic format.  

In addition to these requirements, the EPA requires that the equipment deliver high-quality, reproducible data fully comparable to the quality of the Affymetrix GeneChips system. Additionally, the vendor must be able to provide detailed sequence identities and annotation of the DNA probes and targeted genes and transcripts, utilizing standard and accessible electronic database or on-line formats.
 
However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA’s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 423490.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

It is also requested that companies validate their experience in building computers used specifically for computer forensics and analysis.

One of the major requirements of the systems is that they include removable drive bays that are protected to prevent the changing of digital evidence.  The system must include components to write protect IDE, SATA, and SCSI hard drives as well as 12 different types of electronic media like Compact Flash Cards.  

**See attached Specifications**

<DESC>This synopsis is a continuation of announcement for Aviation Security Quality Control - Technical Assistance/Training Programs initially synopsized under USTDA-05-Q-91-358.  The requirement of the Government has not changed. 

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to publish a request for proposals to negotiate a competitive contract for a series of technical assistance (TA) training programs focused on aviation security quality control to be conducted in three regions:  (1) the Americas;(2) Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and (3) Asia.  The proposed training programs would be developed in collaboration with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  Over the course of approximately one year, the training will take place over the course of three days within each region.  The same training session will be offered twice in the Americas, twice in Asia, and three times in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, for a total of seven trainings.

The objective of this TA is to bring together foreign officials responsible for the nation’s aviation quality control programs.  It will provide a forum to learn and to discuss how quality control can be enhanced in each of their countries and standardized throughout the regions.  The training program would also highlight the benefits to international trade that would result from better securing the commercial aviation sector.  The TA will educate participants on activity will also assist USTDA with its efforts to promote trade opportunities for U.S. suppliers abroad.  USTDA anticipates award of a single contract, at a ceiling price of NTE $600,000, based on a cost, plus, fixed-fee basis.

The solicitation package will be available on or about the week of July 18, 2005.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-05-R-0028 for the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts to provide software engineering support to SPAWARSYSCEN C4I programs.  Specific efforts shall include engineering products related to C4I software applications and database or database management systems for current and new C4I systems.  System engineering efforts may include support for the web-enablement of applications and services to support Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Net-Centric Warfare efforts.  The technical support shall entail the full range of software development including system requirements, design, implementation, integration, and documentation.. Awardees of contracts under this RFP will compete for task orders to perform actual work. Each contract will be awarded for the entire estimated level- of-effort specified in the RFP; however, the competition of task orders may reduce each awardees actual total effort to a level significantly below the ceiling value of each award. The estimated level of effort for the planned period of performance of five years (including options) is 296,500 hours. This is a full and open competition, anticipated to result in the award of an estimated two to five contracts. Small Businesses (SB) are especially encouraged to submit proposals as prime contractors. The Government desires to issue one or more awards to SBs. The NAICS codes for this procurement are 541330, 541511, and 541519. The incumbent contractors are Polexis (N66001-00-D-5029), FGM (N66001-00-D-5073), NGIT (N66001-00-D-5074), SAIC (N66001-00-D-5075), and Silver Bullet (N66001-00-D-5076). A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided. The solicitation will only be available electronically on the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command E-Commerce Web Page at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC San Diego - Open Solicitations. Any amendments, when issued, will also be available only on this web site. Issuance of the solicitation is estimated for 25 July 2005.

<CONTACT>Ronald Saville, Contract Specialist, 781-266-9567 Thomas Russo, Contracting Officer, 781-266-9179
<DESC>1.0 Goal: Operational C2 Systems Group (OC2SG), ASOC Program Office at Hanscom AFB, MA is seeking sources to provide enhancement and sustainment of Air Sovereignty Operations Center (ASOC) systems. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are any responsible sources available who are capable of performing this CLS effort. <br><br> 2.0 Introduction: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  It is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a Request for Proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The NAICS code is 541512 with an SBA size standard of $18,000,000. Interested parties should make it known if they qualify as a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business. Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S.-owned or foreign-owned firm. <br><br> 3.0  Background: Air Sovereignty Operations Center (ASOC) software and hardware were procured from Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS), Eagan MN for eight Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers located in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia; hereafter referred to as Central and Eastern Europe. Enhancement and sustainment of ASOC systems requires providing all management and labor necessary for software maintenance and enhancements for ASOC, an air defense command and control (C2) system. The term "ASOC" is a U.S. Government-assigned system name. Prime contractor work on the ASOC system will require a U.S. Government facility security clearance.   ASOC application software is a proprietary product of LMTS.  Unlimited U.S. Government rights to ASOC applications software applies to compiled code and does not apply to source code.  LMTS has changed its name to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors or, LM MS2. <br><br> 4.0  Principal System Components: The ASOC is a Sun Solaris-based air defense command and control system capable of multi-radar tracking using up to 100 sensors. The typical ASOC has ten operator display workstations. Configurations vary in size from 6 to 12 workstations.  New Automated Data Processing (ADP) equipments were installed in late 2004/early 2005 at all customer sites and are expected to remain operational for the duration of the Basic and two Option periods described below.  Sun V-240 servers host ASOC application software and Sun Blade 1500 host operator workstations. Primary system communications use MPS-1000 multi-protocol communications server. <br><br> 5.0  Key System Features: The ASOC processes digitized radar data received from military and civil radars; as well as flight plan information, to provide an integrated identified air situation display. The system accepts primary and secondary radar data in EUROCONTROL ASTERIX plot data format, track data in NATO Link-1 and EUROCONTROL ASTERIX track data formats, and flight plan data in ICAO/OLDI formats. Using the ASOC system, military operators conduct surveillance and identification of all objects in the airspace and exercise control over air weapons systems using ground controlled intercept (GCI) guidance capabilities and surface-to-air (SAM) missile control capabilities.  The system also operates in a remote operations mode while communicating with the host system. <br><br> 6.0 Vendor Qualification: If the Government issues a request for proposal or awards a contract as a result of this request, the duration of this effort is expected to be for the Basic period from 01 JAN 2006 through 31 DEC 2006 plus 2 option years.

<DESC>The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice modification is to clarify the Department's Web Accessibility Initiative requirement.  The Department of Education (ED) intends to issue a request for proposals for research and development to continue efforts to ensure long term accessibility of the web for people with disabilities by developing Web Standards and Guidelines. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international organization that researches and develops web standards.  W3C engages in education and outreach, develops software, and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.  W3C Members and a dedicated full-time staff of technical experts have earned international recognition for contributions to the Web.  W3C members, staff, and invited experts work together to design technologies to ensure that the Web will continue to thrive in the future, accommodating the growing diversity of people, hardware, and software.

Accessibility of the Web to individuals with disabilities is the responsibility of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which is part of the W3C.  The WAI project was developed by staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to ensure that the World Wide Web is accessible to all.  WAI, in coordination with organizations around the world, pursues accessibility of the Web through five primary areas of work: technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach, and research and development.

The United States' representative to the W3C/WAI is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  In order to support the critical mission of continuing development for WEB accessibility and in recognition of the MIT status as the U.S. representative to the organization undertaking this work, ED intends to place a contract on a sole source basis to MIT, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), for research and development services related to making the web accessible to people with disabilities.  MIT, which has significant knowledge, technical expertise, and many years of experience in the field of web accessibility requirements for the World Wide Web, is uniquely qualified to conduct the needed research and is the only source that will satisfy ED's requirement.  All responsible sources, however, may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to support Launch Range operations IAW the following specifications.  The UAV must be able to carry instrumentation payloads and allow for external antenna mounting.  The UAV should be under positive control at all times during operations, but could have an autonomous mode for loitering or the loss of ground control.  Positive control would enable the UAV to be vectored to any site in the launch area where the on-board instrumentation payload should be utilized to relay measurements to the ground.  The vehicle should be a proven design with its performance verified, meet all NASA requirements, and be provided in a timely manner.  NASA Kennedy Space Center has a controlled field where UAVs can be launched and recovered.  The following characteristics are required: 1) TYPE:   Fixed Wing or Vertical Take-Off & Landing (VTOL). 2) SIZE:   No hard specifications.   A design that will meet the requirements for payload, power, altitude, time-on-station, control system, and cost.	    3) WEIGHT:   Same as requirements for Size.  4) PAYLOAD CAPACITY:   Minimum of 20 lbs, with 30 lbs desirable.	 The payload compartment should have a minimum volume of ¾ to 1 cubic foot.  5) ENGINE/FUEL:   As required to carry the payload and control/flight instrumentation and remain aloft in the time required.	 Engine should be protected from foreign object damage (FOD) during flight.  6) ENDURANCE:  Minimum of 60 minutes with 90 minutes desirable.  7) PERFORMANCE:   Altitude: As a minimum, surface up to 5,000 feet.  Speed: no minimum or maximum. 8) CONTROLS:   UAV must be remotely controlled from a ground station with a display which gives true location when the vehicle is out of visual sight from the station.    The system must allow for pre-programmed flight paths and pre-programmed no-fly zones – both specified by way-points    On-board video is desirable as an aid to surveillance and landing.	  Any Radio Frequency (RF) equipment used for ground-to-air and air-to-ground control/communication must be FCC licensed.   9) GLOBAL POSITION SYSTEM (GPS):	    Required for tracking the UAV in real time and archiving for future flight playback. 10) FLIGHT TERMINATION SYSTEM (FTS):   The UAV must have a system which will terminate its operation if it constitutes a hazard to people or property.	 Each FTS system will be reviewed by Range Safety personnel for compliance.    Possible systems should include engine “kill-switch” or parachute deployment or both. 11) LOSS OF SIGNAL:   In the event of any loss of control of the UAV from the ground the vehicle must be capable of initiating a recovery procedure.	 This can work in conjunction with a flight termination system (FTS).  12) POWER-TAKE-OFF:	A power plant direct current (DC) generator should be required if the payload capacity and take off weight should not accommodate batteries to power the payload instrumentation.				 13) ANTENNAS:	UAV should accommodate antennas required by the payload instrumentation down-link.   These links could be frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or Iridium phone modem.   14) MANEUVERABILTY:    The UAV must possess the flight characteristics to either hover over a “target area” or fly tight patterns that will enable the payload instrumentation to take the required readings.	Additional desired characteristics include the following:	1) SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS:	Desirable as a back-up to the primary control data link and to maintain communications and control of the UAV in the event of over-the-horizon flight.    2) AUTOMONOUS FLIGHT:   Desirable in the event of the loss of control from the ground to enable the UAV to fly itself to a “safe” area.	  Also desirable to keep the UAV in an idle configuration, or perform other predictable maneuvers as required by launch area Range Safety procedures.  3) Live video to aid in target location and/or landing. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet or exceed the above requirement must submit the following: 1) A capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein; 2) Interested offerors may provide any relevant documentation, literature, and brochures; 3) Responses must also include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.  The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, DHHS, is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and capability of firms able to establish an NIAID resource to provide services for activities commonly associated with preclinical development of therapeutic agents, including those activities required for the submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. 

One award is expected to be made in response to this solicitation. NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all of the preclinical development services set forth in the Statement of Work and, consequently, that the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and resources of subcontractors to perform the tasks required.  Therefore, the services to be provided under the contract shall be performed either directly by the Contractor or indirectly through subcontractors. At a minimum, the Contractor will be required to:1) provide an infrastructure for the overall technical and administrative management; 2) provide the personnel, equipment, technical expertise, and infrastructure either at their own facilities or identify qualified subcontractors; 3) solicit for and evaluate subcontract proposals, and execute, manage and assess subcontractor performance; 4) retain all records, samples, histopathological slides, etc., as indicated by GLP and cGMP guidelines; 5) maintain awareness of evolving regulatory requirements for preclinical evaluations of therapeutic agents; 6) arrange for site visits and independent audits, as needed or as requested by the NIAID Project Officer; 7) develop and/or submit to NIAID, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for any of the assays, processes, procedures, etc. performed by the Contractor or a subcontractor in the execution of this contract; 8) participate as necessary in discussion with the FDA during pre-IND, IND, pre-new drug application (NDA), and pre-biologic license application (BLA) meetings; and 9) provide an orderly transition to a successor contractor or to the United States Government at the end of the contract.
The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed under this contract including that performed by any subcontractor(s).

Mandatory qualification criteria.  

Mandatory Criterion #1: The Offeror must document access to BSL2 and 3 facilities.

Mandatory Criterion #2:  The Offeror must document access to an AAALAC-accredited (or equivalent) animal facility and the capacity (appropriate cage space, etc.) for  In Vitro and In Vivo Preclinical Safety, Toxicology, and Biokinetics Services. To assess capacity, assume the following studies involving animals will be done each year: 
(a)	toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies for one compound per year under GLP: acute and oral intravenous (iv) toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) studies in rats; acute oral toxicity and PK studies in dogs; 14 day oral toxicity study in rats with toxicokinetics; 14 day oral toxicity study in dogs with toxicokinetics; and
(b)	reproductive toxicity testing of two compounds per year. 

Mandatory Criterion # 3:  The Offeror must document prior successful completion and submission to the FDA of preclinical studies performed under GLP by the Offeror or proposed subcontractors as required to fulfill the services included in the Statement of Work that require studies/assays to be performed according to GLP guidelines. Include an indication of FDA acceptance of studies.

Potential Sources must also demonstrate and document the following abilities:

(1)	Experience in providing preclinical development services and resources for therapeutic agents in the following five (5)  categories:  (a) lead identification and development services; (b) chemistry and manufacturing services; (c) in vitro microbiological services; (d) in vitro and in vivo preclinical safety, toxicology, and biokinetics services; and (e)  preclinical development planning and evaluation services. 

(2)	Demonstrated understanding of and experience with regulatory requirements for preclinical activities leading to submission of INDs; appropriate quality assurance/quality control methods; ability to define milestones and approaches to tracking progress toward milestone achievement; and knowledge of problems/obstacles likely to occur at various stages of preclinical therapeutic development and proposed approaches for addressing such problems/obstacles.

(3)	Demonstrated experience with:
a.	receiving, formatting, storing and shipping compounds and biological agents:
b.	technology transfer processes:
c.	shipping, handling and storing pathogens or toxins that require select agent registration; and
d.	providing and evaluating preclinical product development plans for therapeutic agents for which the Animal Efficacy Rule (21CFR Parts 314 and 601) may impact the licensure path. 

(4)	Experience working with potential biohazards, toxic chemicals, and radioisotopes; and adequacy of the plan for training, implementation, and monitoring of safety procedures.

(5)	Demonstrated experience to oversee, coordinate, integrate and manage work performed including activities carried out under subcontracts.

Interested small business organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas above, to be received no later than 3:30 PM local time on July 18, 2005, to the attention of Erin Goldstein at the address listed above.

<SOLNBR>RFPX000535
<RESPDATE>072505
<ARCHDATE>08092005
<CONTACT>Laurie Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-0954, Fax 202-616-6055, Email llwilliams@bop.gov - Richard Formella, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-0954, Fax 202-616-6055, Email rformella@bop.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  This is not a request for proposals.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) requires new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations.  A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz.  The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher.  The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel.  It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy.  The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios.  Services will include:  project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training.   In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space.  Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent).  In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.

This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets.  This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition.  Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement.  Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:  
 
1.Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;
2. Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;
3. On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;
4. Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;
5. Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;
6. Telephone technical support; and 
7. Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.

It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements.  Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment.  One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.

Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged.

<CONTACT>Dora Hill, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-7512, Fax 301-757-7054, Email dora.hill@navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) for planning purposes.     This is NOT a Request for Proposal.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this  RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify innovative approaches to providing a broad based support package that is efficient and embraces continuous process and product improvement to optimize the life cycle support provided to the Navy/Marine Corps forces operating ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS), worldwide.  To provide a more cost-effective readiness solution for the entire ALQ-99 TJS, Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support is being considered for the entire inventory and peculiar support/test equipment.  PBL support of the ALQ-99 Pod includes, but not limited to, maintenance planning and analysis, supply support, configuration management, and obsolescence management.  A draft Statement of Work is available on the website located at https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm.  To get access to this website, you will need to register at http://www.crane.navy.mil/tdc.  When registering, use Kim Horn as the Government POC and ALQ-99 TJS POD PBL as the justification for access.  
As delineated in Title 10 USC Sec. 2464, ALQ-99 TJS depot maintenance must be performed at a Government owned and operated facility, by Government personnel.     For depot level maintenance, public/private partnership is the required approach to meet Title 10 USC core logistics capability requirements.    
Industry Days will be held at Crane, IN on 13-14 July 2005 from 1000 – 1800.  The purpose of Industry Days is to discuss ALQ-99 TJS product support  by providing an overview, tours, and question and answer session in the form of a public forum.    The point of Contact for visit requests or travel information is Kim Horn, kimberly.horn@navy.mil.  Request interested parties submit  their intent to attend Industry Days and and submit visit request by  11 July 2005.  Questions regarding PBL may be submitted in writing to Dora Hill at dora.hill@navy.mil or Trudy Carroll at trudy.carroll@navy.mil.   Questions submitted prior to 11 July 2005 may be addressed during Industry Days, however, all questions and answers will be posted on the website, https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm .  
The AN/ALQ-99 TJS is the first fully integrated, computer controlled, support jamming system. The AN/ALQ-99 intercepts and automatically processes electromagnetic signals and power manages the system's transmitters to effectively jam large numbers of diverse threats with very high effective radiated power. Since its deployment in the early 1970's aboard US Marine Corps and US Navy carrier-based EA-6B Prowler aircraft, this system has undergone multiple upgrades. The EA-6B/ALQ-99 combination has become an indispensable fleet asset, fully integrated into all air wing combat missions.
The ALQ-99 is comprised of an On Board System (OBS) and a Tactical Jamming System (TJS). The OBS includes the receiver, processor, and aircrew interfaces and is used to collect tactical electronic order of battle (EOB) data which can be disseminated through the command and control system while airborne, and which can be recorded and processed after missions to provide updates to various orders of battle. The TJS includes a selection of mission-configured jammer pods carried as external stores. The modular open architecture of the TJS facilitates optimizing transmitters and antennas for a given frequency range, as well as tailored mission configurations. 
	Each jammer pod contains a ram air turbine generator, two selectable transmitter modules with associated antennas, and a universal exciter that is interfaced with and controlled by the onboard system and aircrew. The scope of the PBL includes the 2,500 weapon replaceable assemblies (WRAs) comprising the TJS portion of the ALQ-99 system only. 

DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is issued solely for information and analytical purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  There is no solicitation in process at this time.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Per FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities (Fedbizops) announcement.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES AND CONTACT INFORMATION:  The Navy plans to use the Internet and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information.  All interested parties shall submit their questions/comments/additional data requests by 1 August 2005.  
Responses to this RFI should include: 1) A Rough Order of Magnitude estimate of vendor non-recurring and recurring costs  2) A description of process changes; 3) A plan of action and timeframe for operational capability ; 4) Any other information at vendor discretion.  A brief company profile/history may be  provided as a separate attachment.

We also respond to Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) and congressional calls and requests for financial plans and status reports during worldwide, theater conflicts, or peacetime operations.  The budget system currently in use by the Air Force is called Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES).  The system has been in existence in some form since the 1960s and currently is hosted on a Unix-based platform, written in C ++ and Ingres.  The ABIDES system houses many modules; the two most critical are the Classified and Unclassified Accounting System and the Financial and Force Planning (F&FP).  ABIDES is recognized as the official Air Force position with respect to the Planning, Programming and Budget Execution (PPBE) system.  Because it has been in use for so many years, the Air Force is in the process of replacing it with the Financial Information Resource System (FIRST) on an Oracle platform.  As the development of FIRST proceeds, ABIDES will need to be maintained/supported on a daily basis for current and historical data and processes will need to be converted into the FIRST data structures.
  
Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the skills and ability to provide the following ABIDES functional data services: 1.) Update the data relationship tables in ADIDES with the most recent and relevant information. 2.)

<SUBJECT>F--Intent to Sole Source / Mediation Services
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Roundtable Associates,2212 Queen Ave N  #265, Seattle WA 98901. The proposed action is for Roundtable Associates to act as mediator for confidential multi-party negotiation of the Reclamation case-in-chief in the Acquavella water rights adjudication. mediation services. Reclamation and the Washington Department of Ecology have agreed that a mediator is necessary to this effort. Reclamation's Report of the Court in the Acquavella adjudication issued on April 14, 2005, gave Reclamation until September 15, 2005, to file exceptions to the Report.  In the interim, Reclamation will engage basin interests through mediation in an effort to negotiate a settlement of outstanding issues.  The goal is to provide the Court with a unified set of stipulated exceptions that will eliminate or drastically reduce the need for litigation over the United States' water rights. Mr. Archey and Roundtable Associates are uniquely qualified to perform these services because of their availability, skill, and track record of neutral facilitation among Yakima Basin interests.  Roundtable Associates has been the facilitator for the Conservation Advisory Group, and has been deeply involved with the Water Transfer Working Group and the recent Yakima Basin Water Exchange initiative.  Mr. Archey is familiar to the settlement parties and a readily acceptable mediator, key considerations in this time-limited and potentially fractious negotiation.  Mr. Archey has an in-depth and current working knowledge of water resources, water law, and Yakima Basin operations, as well as the organizational skill, computer resources, and mediation expertise necessary for this task.    The goal is to reach accord on stipulated exceptions to the Report of the Court by the filing deadline on September 15, 2005.  Mr. Archey's knowledge of the Yakima basin, his familiarity with the key players in this negotiation, and his outstanding organizational and management skills ensures that this process can quickly get on track.  To obtain the services of another mediator who would be acceptable to the parties, as well-grounded in the particulars of the Yakima basin, and as skilled in facilitation would cause unacceptable delay, particularly given the current schedule imposed by the Acquavella Court.  Mr. Archey's combination of skills, knowledge, and party acceptability are the most cost effective solution for Reclamation and the other mediation parties. Tasks: 1)  Facilitate negotiations 	-- Keep notes and minutes; reduce to written form; circulate among parties for review and comment. 	-- Schedule meetings and venues.                 -- Generate agendae.                 -- Organize work groups, track milestones, and enforce deadlines.                 -- Maintain files of exhibits, documents, and other relevant materials. 2)  Mediate negotiations 	-- Act as neutral to resolve conflicts among parties. 	-- Suggest alternative resolutions and negotiation strategies. 3)  Provide summary reports on results of mediated negotiations. Qualification Criteria: Successful contractor must: 	Possess a high degree of organizational skill and attention to detail 	Be acceptable to the full spectrum of Yakima Basin interests 	Be skilled in facilitation and negotiation techniques 	Possess the ability to maintain cordial relationships with parties 	Be skilled in computer software applications and internet research resources 	Have a working knowledge of Yakima Basin water resources 	Be knowledgeable of water resources and Washington State water law The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business July 11, 2005  will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov. For technical information please contact James D.

<SUBJECT>A -- HIV Vaccine Research
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a Purchase Order to the Caribbean Primate Research Center, Unit of Comparative Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The purchase is a collaborative initiative with the Caribbean Primate Research Center, Unit of Comparative Medicine and Centers for Disease Control Prevention.  It is a continuing requirement utilizing the same vaccinated and challenged rhesus macaques located at the Caribbean Primate Research Center.   These animals are valuable because there was no obvious correlate of protection among the parameters and a wide range of immunologic responses.  A therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine study is a natural progression to learn more from these animals.  There are no other primate centers that would have these vaccinated monkeys, and to start this project over with new monkeys would be a substantial duplication of effort, and cost to the government.  By virtue, the Caribbean Primate Research Center and Unit of Comparative Medicine is uniquely qualified and capable of carrying out the requirements of this proposed purchase order.  The anticipated award date is July 21, 2005.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification, as well as, a capability statement to the contracting office by July 20, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed actions based on responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be sent to the attention of Pamela Bolling by e-mail at pbolling@cdc.gov or by fax 770-488-2688.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for PharmASSIST Enterprise System workstations to Innovation Associates, 627 Field Street, Johnson City, NY 13790-1057.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10515, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the analysis of up to 3000 samples of estuarine seawater for nutrients (dissolved and totals) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (USEPA, 2001) (NCA).  NCA will provide the contractor with a split sample consisting of a filtered and unfiltered portion of a seawater sample from each site.  Dissolved nutrient analyses will be performed on the filtered sample and total N & P on the unfiltered portion.  Samples will be clearly labeled for each part of the analysis.  A minimum of one hundred (100) samples  will be guaranteed.  Samples up to the maximum of 3000 are optional and will be provided at the discretion of the government.  The period of performance will be three years from the date of award.  Proposals shall include a demonstration of capability to perform the analyses; references, previous experience with seawater samples, method detection limits, and proposed methodology.  The contractor shall submit a copy of their Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols with the proposal package.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described for the National Coastal Assessment Program. The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice).  The successful contractor shall be required  to analyze standard reference materials, provided by EPA, prior to the initiation of full sample analysis for NCA.  The contractor shall be required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as ?National Coastal Assessment: Nutrients  - Contractor Name / Contract Number? and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box.  To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following  conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies.  NCA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods; therefore, in keeping with EMAP?s performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval,  proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be reviewed by NCA to ensure that the program?s quality standards are met.  Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria for the Laboratory Determinations of Dissolved and Total Nutrients:  Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of dissolved  N (nitrite+nitrate), nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosphate, from a filtered portion of the seawater sample, and total N and P using an unfiltered portion shall be conducted by using an autoanalyzer (e.g., Technicon AutoAnalyzer, or similar); the use of an autoanalyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Nitrate concentration shall be determined indirectly by subtracting nitrite from nitrate+nitrite.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples.  Samples shall be analyzed in batches consisting of 15-20 field samples per batch along with the following required QC check samples: Laboratory blank, Spike/recovery check sample, Duplicate sample, Standard (mid-level). Because  the NCA nutrient samples will span a wide range of salinities, it may be necessary to group field samples into general categories of salinity (e.g., 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, etc) and analyze a the various groups of samples against standards prepared with water of corresponding salinity.  Reporting units shall be in umoles & mg/L (N or P); samples shall be identified to the site by using the NCA site ID code; all samples must link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted both electronically (ASCII delimited) and in hardcopy format.  Data reports shall be received within 90 days from receipt of samples. Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Requirements:  The basic QA/QC requirements for the analyses of dissolved nutrients, as described in the National Coastal Assessment Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), include  the following:  Method Detection Limits (MDLs) - 0.005 mg/L for N species; 0.002 mg/L for o-P; Calibration curve - correlation efficiency of =0.99; Percent Spike Recovery -  ? 10% of true standard value ( i.e., 90 - 110% recovery); Duplicate Analysis - Relative percent difference (RPD) of 30%; Laboratory Blank - < 3x MDL.

1.0 Statement of Work
The Office of Coast Survey requires a precise navigation system for its existing Hydroid REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to continue evaluating the vehicle as an effective tool for hydrographic surveying.   The navigation system should include WAAS-enabled GPS and inertial navigation (INS) integrated into the vehicle and a WAAS-enabled GPS equipped acoustic positioning buoy system.

1.1 Background
The Coast Survey Development Lab Hydrographic Systems and Technology Programs is testing the use of  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) for use as a tool to conduct hydrographic surveys to augment the existing NOAA fleet of hydrographic survey ships and launches.  In FY04 a Hydroid REMUS AUV was purchased through a competitive process by OCS in partnership with NMAO to serve as a test and evaluation vehicle.  

Phase 1 testing of the vehicle was performed by OCS personnel during the FY04 field season (June-September 2004).  The primary goal of the testing was to build operational expertise with an AUV.  A secondary goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the vehicle’s navigation system for conformance to standards required for operational surveys.  The Phase 1 test results proved the viability of AUV’s as potential tools for hydrographic surveying.  However, the initial testing revealed that the navigation systems, as originally specified and accepted, would not meet operational requirements for hydrographic side scan sonar surveys (detection and positioning of a 1 cubic meter cubic target within 10 meters accuracy).

AUV’s are an emerging and rapidly developing technology, and in the time since the vehicle was specified and purchased significant improvements to AUV navigation and positioning have become available.  Specifically, the addition of GPS and an inertial navigation system (INS) to the REMUS AUV, along with the addition of GPS to the acoustic positioning buoys should increase the navigational accuracy sufficiently for OCS to continue its evaluation of this technology as a survey tool.

2.0 Objectives
NOAA requires that the existing Hydroid REMUS AUV (S/N 241) be upgraded as follows:

•	Integration of a WAAS enabled GPS receiver into the vehicle’s body and navigation system to allow for accurate positioning of the vehicle while on the surface to update the navigation solution of other onboard sensors, including acoustic navigation and Inertial Navigation System.

•	Modification of the vehicle’s end-cap to allow for integration of new sensors via guest ports.

•	Upgrade of existing Paradigm buoy acoustic positioning system to Gateway buoy system, including addition of WAAS-enabled GPS and acoustic communications on each of two buoys.  This will facilitate the accurate positioning of the acoustic navigation reference buoys and allow for the AUV’s navigation information to relayed back to the monitoring vessel via acoustic modem and radio.

•	Integration of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) into the vehicles navigation system.  This will allow the vehicle to accurately navigate between acoustic or GPS position updates.

•	Delivery of the modified vehicle will be no later than 6 weeks after the successful offeror receives the order and NOAA’s REMUS AUV.

Additionally, NOAA requires training on the new systems at the manufacturer’s facility to ensure correct and effective use and maintenance.  Training should be conducted concurrent with the delivery of the modified vehicle.

Another change is that the current contract is actually $131,595.62

If there are any questions call me at 210-671-5013.

The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

3.12.4	A financial analysis of the project. This section should consider the availability of equity and debt financing as well as the views of potential public and private financing organizations, such as the World Bank, relevant regional multilateral development bank(s), Ex-Im and OPIC.

3.12.5 An appropriate environmental analysis of the project. A preliminary review of the project’s anticipated impact on the environment with reference to local requirements and those of multilateral lending agencies (such as the World Bank).  This review would identify potential negative impacts, discuss the extent to which they can be mitigated, and develop plans for a full environmental impact assessment if and when the project moves forward to the implementation stage.  This includes the identification of steps that will need to be undertaken by the project sponsor subsequent to the study’s completion and prior to project implementation. 

3.12.6 A review of regulatory issues related to the project.  This should include a discussion of any regulations that would impact the projects viability or prognosis to move forward.

The analysis shall focus on what Development Impact is likely if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.  While specific focus shall be paid to the immediate impact of the project, analysis shall include any additional developmental benefits that may result from the project’s implementation, including spin-off and demonstration effects.

Accordingly, the analysis shall be an assessment of each of the following categories with respect to the project’s potential Development Impact:

(1)  Infrastructure:  Provide a statement on the infrastructure impact, giving a brief synopsis.  For example, “The project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve ___ [number] additional households in ____ [area].”


(2)  Market- Oriented Reform:  Provide a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

(3)  Human Capacity Building:  Assess the number and type of local positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project, as well as the number of local people who would receive training; describe such potential training program.

 (4)  Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement:  Provide a description of any advanced technologies that would be utilized as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that would be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%”).

(5)  Other:  Describe any other developmental impacts or benefits that would result from the project, for example, follow-on or replication projects, safer workplace, increased good governance or improved financial revenue flows to the Host Country.

For specific information regarding USTDA’s Development Impact goals and measures, please contact the COTR at USTDA, or see the Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures at www.ustda.gov/resources.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission consultant to travel to Ethiopia to assess opportunities for USTDA assistance in the telecommunications sector with the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation (ETC).  The ETC has requested assistance specifically in bid evaluation and in business plan development, and in developing pricing strategies.  U.S. companies bidding on this definitional mission should demonstrate experience with a broad range of telecommunications issues and specific experience with the requested components from ETC.  It is expected that the U.S. company will work directly with ETC to develop an appropriate set of projects that USTDA can consider for funding.

Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.
