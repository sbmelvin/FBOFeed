<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with WesternGeco, 3600 Briarpark Dr, Houston, Texas, 77042.  The proposed contract is for marine seismic reflection data in the Exclusive Zone offshore of the western US.  The data to be provided to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) includes the digital field data, the digital processed (stack and migration) data, navigation data, observer and processing logs, and the film playouts of the processed profile sections.  All digital data will be delivered on high-density media (DVD, DLT or 3590).  Data to be delivered include all of the digital and analog data from the California surveys listed on the reuest for quote.  WesternGeco, a major geophysical contractor, holds large quantities of marine 2D seismic reflection profile data acquired over the past 30 years offshore western United States within the US Exclusive Economic Zone, and the company has offered to transfer these data to the USGS.  These data were acquired by WesternGeco and are the sole property of that company.  The reacquisition of these data is not cost effective to the government.  Furthermore, these data have particular value because modern environmental concerns would significantly increase the cost of reacquisition.  The data consist of several components (digital files and associated paper records), and as the owner and manager of these data, WesternGeco is uniquely qualified to organize all of the components for delivery. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>C.2.1 PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE The purpose of this project is to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), its various Divisions and other components of CDC with support for disseminating information and transferring knowledge related to research, treatment and care, and prevention efforts to CDC constituents, partners and stakeholders and the general public. This shall be accomplished by providing expertise and systems for the proactive diffusion and dissemination of information and the reactive response to the needs of the NCHSTP, other CDC programs and CDC target audiences. To respond to the current user needs and to utilize state-of-the-art technology will require a major redirection in the design and operation of services of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN). The future CDC NPIN will implement and incorporate the recommendations and the findings of the NPIN Assessment Study, which is based on current user needs and CDC programmatic requirements and will remain flexible as needs and technology change. The project will support multiple information systems on behalf of NCHSTP and other related CDC program needs. It is a complex requirement incorporating data from federal, state, and local governments as well as private and not-for-profit sectors. It is not a traditional clearinghouse operation?these requirements involve techniques of knowledge and information transfer based on state-of-the-art technology that will afford rapid response mechanisms. Delivery of technical assistance is a primary requirement with the goal of building capacity for transferring information and knowledge into public health practice. Information services and support must be rapid, accurate, and flexible in their delivery mechanisms, dealing with different working conditions and environments. The project will be required to offer ?value-added? products and services where research, guidelines, policies and information from CDC must be translated, summarized, organized, stored for retrieval, and disseminated in various formats, through a variety of channels, in a timely manner. C.3 BACKGROUND AND NEED C.3.1 Introduction The challenge of this procurement is to make the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) services and support a ?state-of-the-art? customer-based operation that can take advantage of technology now and in the future. For the duration of the project and beyond, the Office of Communications, NCHSTP, looks to advance the development of information services that provide: A. Interactivity designed to enhance partnerships, individual responsiveness, promote better communication, disseminate information, and assess professional and public information needs. B. Ease of access for all. C. Use of current technology to broaden the range of prevention information dissemination and to reduce information-transfer costs. D. Networked linking and transfer of science-based health information with and to our primary audiences. E. Increased awareness of NCHSTP and other CDC programs that use these services and the value of their information. F. Adoption and utilization of NCHSTP and CDC prevention information by all of its audiences. C.3.2 Background The services and products of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) provide a primary mechanism for the National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) and other CDC programs to support prevention partners, stakeholders, and other constituents. The business of CDC NPIN is knowledge/information transfer. C.3.3 The Challenge In the past decade, with the expanded use of the Internet as a channel for health information, there has been a proliferation of providers of information about HIV/AIDS. The Web also offers sites for STD and TB information, although not in the volume that can be found for HIV/AIDS. The newer technology has changed the way people access information and there has been a corresponding expansion and demand for information. The original mission of these services was cast in the broadest terms by the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic and by the Omnibus Legislation of 1988. Early efforts were clearly ?demand driven? as CDC NPIN and its predecessor, the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse, struggled to be responsive to all legitimate information needs and the resulting pressures of increasing demand. The dramatic changes taking place in the dissemination of information and the increased number of sources of information, have fostered a spirit of change and a need to rethink the services and products of NPIN, to tailor them to current user needs, and to take advantage of evolving technology. In addition, the level of sophistication of NPIN audiences is heightened, and their information/knowledge needs require more depth and breadth in content areas. The Office of Communications (OC), NCHSTP, has the responsibility to assure close collaboration of the Center?s various information and communication efforts, along with those being undertaken by other parts of CDC. The OC provides coordination of information services and support for NCHSTP and for other CDC users of these services. A customer-based assessment of the mission/purpose, audience, services, and products of NPIN was carried out in the past year. The evaluation project offered an opportunity to determine user needs, to find out which services and products are meeting those needs and which are no longer relevant. The competition of a contract to provide information services and support can then assure that the findings of this study be employed as guidance for the future. Major findings of the study, conclusions and recommendations can be found at Exhibit G, Reference Materials. As the report indicates, this project supports multiple information systems on behalf of the NCHSTP and other CDC CIO?s. It is a highly complex requirement incorporating data and information from the federal, state, and local governments, academia, community-based organizations, NGO?s and industry, serving a broad audience that includes health professionals and the general public. The redirection of this project requires a wide range of personnel with varied expertise, including, but not limited to: health care professionals, medical information specialists, database experts, systems analysts, Web designers, graphic artists, translators, inventory management specialists, librarians, health educators, and administrative personnel with experience in managing complex and demanding task-oriented projects. The contractor must have appropriate scientific, public health, medical, health communications knowledge as well as expertise in knowledge transfer, data abstraction, data validation, technical writing, and communicating complex scientific and medical issues in terms and formats that are easily understood. In order to take advantage of new and evolving technologies and changing user needs and preferences, NCHSTP anticipates substantial changes in work requirements during the contract term. There will be a need for transition of services as changes are made. The Contractor should be prepared to show an understanding of the transition process?preserving the value of current services and products as new or changed ones are put in place. CDC NPIN cannot simply ?shut down? and change. New directions must be put in place gradually and without interruption of services. C.3.4 Customer Base Priority targets for the services of NPIN and for communications and information efforts include state and local health agencies, community-based organizations, state and local education agencies, national and regional organizations, STD constituent clinics, training centers, the media, and academic institutions and researchers. NPIN also provides support for educational institutions, students, and business and labor organizations seeking information and assistance to deal with HIV, STD, and TB in the workplace, and to religious organizations/institutions involved in education and outreach services. The NPIN services target partners in HIV, STD, and TB prevention. However, the general public has access to the phone lines and the Web site. Therefore, the information services provided must be comprehensive, flexible, and tailored where appropriate to target audiences. Marketing efforts, however, will be directed to audiences and institutions that are targeted as primary audiences, as defined by the government. The emphasis on the Internet and evolving technologies is a primary channel for information dissemination, requiring refocusing services as appropriate. The government is hopeful that this competition will produce a Contractor with creative ideas about how to reach target audiences and how to serve the needs of all customers of NPIN services. The Office of Communications is also looking for creative ideas about how to monitor and assess customer satisfaction and needs in a changing technological environment. The CDC National HIV and STD Hotline historically have used NPIN facilities and personnel to maintain their referral database and to execute their fulfillment needs. This requires a great deal of collaboration and coordination between contractors. In addition, NPIN has occasionally responded to information requests from members of the general public. At some time during the life cycle of this contract, the following requirements will be transitioned to a new CDC-wide Consumer Response Contract: A. Solicitation and marketing of toll-free lines to the general public, B. Support for toll-free lines targeting the general public in the form of a reference and referral database for use by information specialists, and C. Fulfillment Operations for toll-free lines in the form of storage and distribution of materials that disseminate information to the general public in response to requests for information received through the toll-free lines. For at least the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), the CDC National HIV and STD Hotline will remain a primary customer of NPIN services?requiring maintenance of a referral database and fulfillment of orders. (See Hotline Support, under ?Non-core requirements.?) Additionally, NPIN will continue to support occasional requests from the general public for the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), after which these requirements will transition to the proposed new CDC Consumer Response Contract. NPIN will continue to offer full service to its primary audiences (see C.3 Customer Base), including toll-free lines, reference and referral databases, and fulfillment operations, throughout the proposed 5-years of the contract. C.4 Tasks The Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the government, shall furnish the equipment, personnel, facilities, supplies, materials, and other resources necessary to develop, maintain, and operate information services and products which will furnish and provide access to HIV/AIDS, STD, TB and other information regarding preventable diseases and conditions. The primary function of this contract will be to provide current health information services and products in support of the NCHSTP. All resource materials produced/maintained under this contract, including databases, all information products, all data, mailing lists, Web sites, telephone protocols (Intellectual Property), etc. are the property of the Government.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Department of Defense, Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Natick Soldier Center is conducting market research to identify potential sources to provide COTS, NDI or near NDI of a Lightweight Integrated Coxswains Helmet.  The focus of this CBD  is to investigate a Lightweight Helmet with existing or future communication, ballistic and visual integration capabilities.  Information and/or samples gathered during this market research will aid in the development of a specification for the above-ment ioned Lightweight Coxswains Helmet, and will substantiate the need for specific requirements outlined therein. This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at t his time.  Samples are not required, however if you choose to submit a sample they will not be returned and there will be no cost incurred to the government. The following is provided as a general statement of the requirement.  The Naval Special Warfare Co mmand requires an improved Coxswains Helmut for their Special Boat Unit operators.   Present systems are cumbersome in size and weight.  The present peak g-force experienced by the boat operators combined with the weight of the helmet is causing short and long-term neck and back injuries.  The helmet must withstand extreme over the water weather environments and maintain a weight of approximately 2.5lbs understanding that lighter is better and less weight is encouraged.  It must have a facemask configuratio n that is easily employed up and down and will support evolutionary design changes such as integrated lens systems.  Integrated communications is critical to future threshold requirements.  All information concerning, integration, technology, repair and en vironmental capabilities on present communication designs or future designs must be included as part of the information submittal.  Any communication system must incorporate a boom microphone configuration.  A requirement exists for the helmet to fit comfo rtably.  Some level of protection for blunt trauma is a minimum requirement.  The Helmet visor(s) must provide protection from all UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths while reducing glare in the daytime, and provide the necessary light transmission for nighttime training and operations.  The protective lens shall be shatterproof, fog resistant, easily replaceable/repairable, and lightweight.  Overall system will be compatible with all weapons and individual equipment, and not cause degradation in weapons manipulat ion, acquiring targets, or maneuvering through small or confined spaces.  The helmet will use Commercial Off The Shelf to the maximum extend practical to meet these requirements.  Responses with data and/or samples are due on or before 22 September 2003, a nd must include either a sample of proposed Coxswain Helmet with an informational package or a drawing with an informational package for initial evaluation and capabilities a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current  availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of future test articles and production units.

<DESC>NA The TACOM-TARDEC Ground Vehicle Simulation Laboratory (GVSL) has a requirement  for real-time ground platform modeling and simulation software for use in engineering evaluations of off-road vehicles.  The GVSL will utilize the software for simulations invo lving embedded components Ã¢Â€Â“ operators, hardware, and/or software.  The simulations will be used in evaluations that consider platform, subsystem, and component performance measures in the areas of dynamic stability, handling, mobility, vibration, acce leration, braking, component load prediction, fuel consumption/power management, and human factors.  The models are intended to be used for design trade study comparisons and for absolute performance predictions.  The GVSL seeks to replicate the influence of component design on system level behavior in order to perform engineering trade anaylsis. Commercial software packages used for the analysis of vehicle dynamic behavior are insufficient:  general purpose methods carry a run-time penalty that limits the level of model resolution and the highly optimized methods present difficulty in model/equati on construction making specific vehicle adaptation difficult. The GVSL seeks highly optimized methods with automated assistance in model/equation construction, as well as making substantial improvements in performance over current real-time solutions by using computing technology to preprocess the problem into a form  that is efficient in the execution phase.  Additionally, the GVSL seeks to employ novel model creation techniques that use automated methods to produce real-time models from high-resolution, non real-time multibody models, and advancements in developing t he means by which subsystem models created using different modeling tools may be used. A cost plus fixed fee level of effort, three  year contract is expected to be awarded under this effort.  A e-proposal conference will be included in the solicitation.  NOTE:  All contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registry (CCR) prior to receiving an award Ã¢Â€Â“ see web-site www.ccr.gov for detail on CCR.

<CONTACT>Gayle McClelland, 757-878-4818
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), proposes to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, entitled 'Guided Launch and Recovery System/Precision Landing System' to Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC ) 444 Salomon Circle Sparks, NV 89434.  This award is subject to the availability of funding.  The resultant contract will consist of a 12 month FFP contract.   The contractor shall design, develop, test and deliver, two complete 'strap-on' palletized iner tial based Precision Landing Systems (PLS) for integration into the UH-60L and CH-47D aircraft, including a complete functional PLS pallet, and dual cockpit displays with all associated cabling.  The contractor shall also design, develop, test and deliver three pre-production PLS 'boxes' with associated cabling.  The contractor shall provide engineering and software support to integrate the PLS systems into the UH-60L and CH-47D aircraft.  The PLS system shall operate on 28VDC aircraft power.  In addition, the contractor shall deliver (1) test plan, (2) final test report, (3) technical data package (TDP) consisting of  (a) a system performance specification, (b) operators manual/maintenance instructions, and (c) engineering drawings and associated lists to l evel III or equivalent, and the contractor shall support a Government Evaluation/Test at Fort Eustis, Virginia.  Vast Government experience including recent experience with extreme 'brownout' environments in Afghanistan and Iraq with alternate technologies  such as FLIR and Radar have highlighted the limitations of these technologies and led the Government to seek an inertial based solution to the 'brownout'/'whiteout' problem.  Sierra Nevada Corporation is the only known source with the unique qualification s based on prior experience with the successful development and demonstration of the prototype interial 'Guided Launch and Recovery' G-LARS system for the UH-1 helicopter.  SNC is the only known source with a 'strap on' inertial based solution for helicopt er operations in a zero visibility environment caused by 'brownout' or 'whiteout' conditions.  The G-LARS system utilizes SNC proprietary software algorithms developed at private expense with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing systems.  The Government h as not acquired a detail design specification, software, software documentation  or a competitive technical data package inclusive of detailed manufacturing data for another competitive source to manufacture the SNC developed G-LARS.  SNC is the only known  source with an existing 'strap on' inertial based precision landing system, however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit proposals. 'Strap-On' capability is essential to allow concept eval uation on flying aircraft to immediately proceed.  Alpha Contracting methods with SNC will be employed.  A solicitation document will not be issued; however, portions of a model contract will be available. A determination has been made that performance und er the contract will require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful firm will be require d to provide an Export-controlled DOD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DOD Directive 5230-25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FBA Federal Ctr., Battle Creek, MI 49017 -3084,, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal to Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN:  AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Rhonda Chase) Building 401, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577 which will be considered. Point of contact i s Ms. Rhonda Chase at (757) 878-2071 or by email: rchase@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Receipt of proposal is due no later than 1:00 PM eastern standard time on 25 Sep tember 2003.

<DESC>APPROXIMATE ISSUE DATE:  Tentative date for release of draft RFP: 4 June 03 
The Ogden Air Logistic Center plans to issue the Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the Environmental Design/Build Program on or about 04 Jun 03.  The RFPs will be issued over the internet at FedBizOps at address http://www.eps.gov.  The objective of this program is to operate sites located on Hill Air Force Base (AFB), UT, or on adjoining properties such as the Utah Test and Training Range, and Little Mountain Test Annex.  The contractors shall be required to furnish personnel and equipment to respond to requests for environmental support, including, but not limited to, CERCLA Remedial/ Removal Actions or RCRA Corrective Actions, installation of environmental equipment or facilities to promote or improve environmental compliance, emergency removal actions, and pollution prevention initiatives at sites under the control of the federal government and at sites which the federal government has been determined to be a generator.  Multiple Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract awards (up to five) are anticipated with total program value of $20.07 million.  Of the five contracts, the government anticipates awarding one to an 8(a) firm and one to a small business firm if the government determines, from the proposals, there are offerors in these categories capable of satisfying the requirement.  The remaining three contracts will be awarded to qualified firms, regardless of size, as a full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 562910, which corresponds to 500 employees.  The government anticipates contract award September 2003 with a ten-year basic period. 
The Contracting Officer (CO), Ms. Valerie Millis, is the sole point of contact for this acquisition.  Address any questions or concerns you may have to the CO.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), has a requirement for “Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey”.   An award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of a cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is CMS’s intent to award one five (5) year contract under NAICS Code 541720 in fiscal year 2004, on a negotiated competitive basis to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price.  Adequate competition is defined as: the receipt of at least (2) competitive proposals in a tier that are qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The solicitation will be available on or about September 15, 2003.  The closing date for receipt of offers will be addressed therein.  Interest parties shall obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following webpage:www.fedbizopps.gov.  This process will be completed in an electric media only through this fedbizopp publication.  Interested parties will need to register in order to be notified of the RFP release and the release of any subsequent amendments.

The cascading evaluation preference is to be applied in the following manner:

First Tier Competition:

This tier is a restricted competition among 8(a), including Hubzone 8(a), business concerns.  It is the desire of CMS to award a contract to an eligible 8(a) business concern provided that adequate competition is received (two (2) or more 8(a) concerns are determined to be eligible for award) and the award can be made at a fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19.202-6).  Offerors submitting proposals under the First Tier Competition must provide 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.     

In the event, pursuant to the above conditions, that an award cannot be made under this First Tier Competition; then the competition for this Tier will stop and the Government will proceed to the Second Tier Competition.  However, in the event that only one qualified proposal is received under this First Tier Competition, the proposal from that 8(a) firm will become eligible to compete for an award in the Second Tier Competition.  

Second Tier Competition:

The Second Tier is also a restricted competition among small business concerns not included in the First Tier, and only becomes a viable competitive award option in the event that an award cannot be made under the First Tier Competition.  In the event that it is determined there are no small business firms eligible for award under this Second Tier Competition, then the competition for this Tier will stop.  At this point, if there was one qualified 8(a) firm from the First Tier Competition that firm would become eligible to compete for the award under the unrestricted Third Tier Competition.  If no proposal received for the First Tier Competition is determined to be eligible for award and only one proposal received for the Second Tier Competition is determined to be eligible for award; then the Government will consider that small business firm for award under the unrestricted Third Tier Competition.  

Small Business offerors submitting proposals under this Second Tier Competition must be providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  

Third Tier Competition:

The Third Tier Competition is an unrestricted, Full and Open Competition.  As indicated above in the situation where there would be a single First Tier offeror or a single Second Tier offeror that offeror would be considered for award for this tier competition.  That offeror, for evaluation for award with Third Tier offerors may elect to be considered for a price evaluation adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (see FAR Part 19.11) or for HUBZone Small Business Concerns (see FAR Part 19.1307).

Provided below is a brief description of the requirements for this effort:

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to contract for design, data collection, and data preparation to continue the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a multi-year survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries.  Interviews for the MCBS have been conducted three times a year since 1991, using computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technology.  The sample consists of approximately 16,000 individuals drawn from the Medicare enrollment files in over 100 primary sampling units.  Interviews are approximately one hour in length and cover health care utilization, expenditures, insurance coverage, health status, illness, disability, and demographic and behavioral characteristics.  Data will be validated and weighted to produce national and regional estimates and to serve as a research database.  Quick turnaround of high quality data will be emphasized for use in formulating national policy.  Proposed period of performance is five years from date of contract award.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on a sole source basis with Best Start Social Marketing, 4809 E. Busch Blvd., Tampa, Florida   33617.  The NAICS Code is 541618.  This acquisition is to summarize the current workplace-specific barriers to support the continuation of breastfeeding faced by working mothers and by their employees and to utilize this information to design and produce resource materials to effectively address certain health barriers.  In developing these materials, the contractor will utilize existing data and literature on the barriers and successful strategies to creating a breastfeeding-friendly workplace.  The contractor shall also review the literature on the benefits of breastfeeding initiation and continuation through the first six (6) to twelve (12) months of the infant's life. Best Start Social Marketing start is a national leader in multidisciplinary breastfeeding education and resource development and has extensive experience developing, implementing and managing breastfeeding support programs. This experience includes the development and management of the Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work program for low income and other women less likely to breastfeed, the Best Start: Breastfeeding for All the Right Reasons marketing program, the Loving Support for a Bright Future Physician and Health Care Provider Kits, and the Using Loving Support to Build Breastfeeding Friendly Communities program. All of these initiatives are national in scope and have resulted from partnership collaborations with Federal, state, and local organizations involved with providing health support for at risk families. Proprietary design and content information from the Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work program and the Using Loving Support to Build Breastfeeding Friendly Communities will be required by this contract to reduce cost and duplication and to increase recognition and utilization by the target audiences.  Best Start Social Marketing, Inc., is the only vendor with the breadth of expertise and affiliation with breastfeeding experts to effectively design and finalize the resource kit in the time required as well as substantially reduce duplication of costs by utilizing proprietary tools in the production of the resource kit. Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of resource kit would have to replicate their previous accomplishments and develop the kit before beginning the initial study on how to develop employer based tools to support breastfeeding.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would be recovered through competition, Therefore, Best Start Social Marketing is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.  Written inquiries must reference Requisition Number HRSA 03-MCHB-063B-DP

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Neurophysiology(LNP) intends on entering into a sole source contract with Improvision Inc., 1 Cranberry Hill, Lexington, MA 02421 to provide software and hardware upgrades to an existing government owned Zeiss Microscope Model # 135 and 200.  The Laboratory of Neurophysiology research/investigations involves imaging experiments of neural stem cells in proliferation and differentiation followed by multi-epitope staining to correlate specific properties of live cells with their stage in development.  In order for the LNP to improve and continue their research, upgrades are required and would allow LNP the ability to simultaneously record multiple physiological properties on-line in cultured cells and in anatomically intact tissue sections, carry out optical imaging of cellular and subcellular signals and further improve the spatio-temporal resolution of each system.  These upgrades will facilitate a better understanding of such important biomedical issues as physiological regulation of developmental changes occurring in the embryonic CNS.  The upgrades for which Improvision’s software/hardware will provide to the LNP’s existing imaging systems are not to the government’s are not matched in compatibility by any comparable systems currently available.  REQUIREMENTS: The Improvision software/hardware upgrades will provide the following: 1) Imaging software will run as native Macintosh OS X application; 2) Software will provide palette control and application panels allowing the user to configure the control functions of the software to users’ specifications.  Palettes may be displayed at the same time, combined (docked) into one or more large palettes, converted into icons or any combination that enhances users’ research, control and analysis functions available, while other tasks are being performed and are activated by single clicking on picture or function; 3) System will allow users to merge an infinite number of colored and monochrome images; 4) System’s graphical user interface will allow users to constantly monitor the status of system-controlled hardware as well as be compatible with and capture images from existing Government owned digital CCD cameras and motorized microscopes; 5) software will allow time series of images to be captured at a user specified intervals, both absolute and elapsed time information will be stored with images; 6) Include Ion Ratio Module with pre-set automation, required for simultaneous on-line acquisition, analysis and graphing of calcium, pH and membrane potential dyes in both raw and calibrated units; 7) Graphing features which allow  users to select an unlimited number of regions of interest for analysis, displayed in both line graph and statistical numerical analysis, capable of displaying singly or with others in different colors for easy reference; 8) Compatability with Openlab 3D Rendering modules capable of providing real time previews of rendered images; 9) Motion tracking and two ten-position filter wheel systems fully integrated and controlled by the system.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5417   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Watermark Numerical Computing c/o Dr. John Doherty, 336 Cliveden Ave. Corinda 4075, Australia. The National Exposure Research Laboratory's Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) is developing computing capabilities that allow sophisticated parameter estimation, sensitivity, and uncertainty methods to be applied to a wide range of environmental modeling problems.  EPA seeks to advance these capabilities throughout  the  environmental modeling community in an effort to improve quality assurance in environmental models and their applications. Towards this goal, EPA is supporting work to effectively merge key parameter estimation technology (PEST) and UCODE software capabilities, creating a combined open-source  software program to be called JUPITER (Joint Parameter IdenTification and Evaluation of Reliability). ERD is seeking expertise on the project through acquisition of technical services from developers of the original software codes that will form the basis of the merged JUPITER technology. This  purchase order will specifically address the provision of services for integration of the PEST software. The EPA has identified Watermark Numerical Computing c/o Dr. John Doherty, the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the  circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their  capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>A.	INTRODUCTION

The Regents of the University of California ("University") on behalf of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ("LBNL") will be soliciting proposals from general contractors interested in becoming Job Order Contracting Subcontractors for LBNL.  This project is hereinafter referred to as the "project."

LBNL is a multi-program national laboratory with a mission to perform leading multidisciplinary research in the energy sciences, general sciences, and life sciences.  The Laboratory is operated by the Regents of the University of California (University) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  LBNL is an independent academic unit of the UC system and is located adjacent to the UC Berkeley campus. 

The Laboratory's research makes use of multidisciplinary collaboration and advanced engineering, computation, communications, fabrication, and other support facilities characteristic of a national laboratory.  The Laboratory's facilities are planned, constructed, and maintained to directly support the research programs and scientific goals, while maintaining compatibility with the University community and the physical setting.

B.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A Job Order Contract is an indefinite quantity contract pursuant to which the Subcontractor will perform a series of individual projects at different University facilities. The Request for Proposal will include a Construction Task Catalog containing over 150,000 construction tasks with preset unit prices. All unit prices are based on local labor, material and equipment prices including the current prevailing wages. The Request for Proposal also includes Technical Specifications, which set forth the quality of workmanship and quality of materials required for the construction tasks.

This Subcontract, if awarded, will be awarded on the basis of a Best Value Source Selection.  Subcontractors will propose two Adjustment Factors to be applied to the Construction Task Catalog. These Adjustment Factors will apply to each unit price in the Construction Task Catalog.  One Adjustment Factor will be for work performed during normal working hours and the other Adjustment Factor will be for work performed during other than normal working hours.  The Request for Proposal will also request information regarding the Offerors' qualifications, proposed staffing, and management approach.

As Work is identified, the selected Subcontractor will participate in a Joint Scope Meeting, at which the scope of work for the individual project will be explained to the Subcontractor and the Subcontractor will be provided an opportunity to ask questions and inspect the site. The University will then prepare a Detailed Scope of Work and issue a Request for Proposal to the Subcontractor. The Subcontractor will prepare a Price Proposal Package for the project including, among other items, a Price Proposal and a schedule. In general, the Price Proposal will be prepared by identifying the proper construction tasks from the Construction Task Catalog and multiplying the pre-set unit prices by the quantity required and by the appropriate Multiplier. The University will review the Price Proposal Package and may request changes. Once an acceptable Price Proposal Package has been submitted, the University will issue a Job Order for the project. 

A separate Job Order will be issued for each project. A Job Order will contain a Detailed Scope of Work, the Project Completion Time, and the price to be paid for the work. The Job Order price shall be a lump sum, fixed price for the completion of the Detailed Scope of Work.

<SUBJECT>76 -- SUBSCRIPTION FOR WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC DATA FOR THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DG1350-03-RQ-0098GJH)
<RESPDATE>082603

<CONTACT>G. Jean Hairston, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-713-0838 x133, Fax 301-713-0808, Email jean.hairston@noaa.gov - Diane Husereau, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-0839 x102, Fax (301) 713-0809, Email diane.c.husereau@noaa.gov
<DESC>76 - SUBSCRIPTION FOR WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC DATA FOR THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES - The U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) invites your company to quote on the following:

The Department of Commerce (DOC) requires 1) access to computer-based data (Data Access) and 2) model-based economic projections (Forecasting and Analysis) to carry out the Department's program.  

Summary  DATA ACCESS: The Department's interest is in a wide range of economic data for the United States and foreign countries that is documented, current, on-line, and easy to use. Moreover, the Department's interest is in the   availability of that data in machine-readable form for off-line use on other computer systems, including personal computers.  Additionally, the Department has a general interest in having rapid access to a wide variety of data that is beyond the specific requirements listed below. It is expected that the offeror will provide a complete listing of all the available data that could be accessed should the need arise.  The offeror must provide the capability to access all data without having to access multiple programs or execute special program interfaces. The offeror should alert the user when the latter inadvertently attempts to access data not specified in the contract.  Downloads of data should automatically result in a Lotus or Excel spreadsheet.  The Department's staff that will access the data are principally economic analysts and not computer professionals. The software that the offeror provides for data access and data manipulation must be flexible, easy to use, and time series oriented. The software must not require knowledge of file access techniques or internal data storage  formats.  The Department will require the offeror to provide complete documentation for all data series.  The Department would prefer documentation in hard copy form listing how stored (e.g. database name, series mnemonic, etc.), source, frequency, period covered, any breaks in the series definition (i.e., consistency), and update schedule. The Department would prefer that the data documentation include alphabetical listings of the offeror's mnemonic system as well as alphabetical listings of the original data sources' (e.g., Bureau of Economic Analysis or Federal Reserve System) variable name. If the latter is not provided, the offeror must provide a reasonable description of how an analyst who knows the original source variable name is able to find the variable in the offeror's data banks.   The Department requires that all documentation on data series be available on-line, and that on-line help facilities are also available.  The Department prefers that information on scheduled and actual series updates be maintained on-line. The Department requires that actual update information be available with each series and also available in a "data notes" file that users are able to consult to determine whether major data components for a particular source have been updated (e.g., the preliminary national accounts series for a recent quarter from BEA).    FORECASTING AND ANALYSIS: In addition, the Department requires a model-based set of economic projections covering a wide variety of data about the U.S. economy. The Department's interest is in the structure of the econometric models supporting the forecasts, the quality of analysis used in interpreting the models, and in the quality of the written analyses.  This includes the availability of data series required by the model, the transparency and "explainability" of the model assumptions and structure, and in software that is easily used by economic analysts to conduct data analysis, econometric estimation, and model building.  It is possible for one offeror to meet the requirements of one of these areas, while another offeror meets the requirements of the other.  Detailed Requirements for Data Access   UNITED STATES DATA  The offeror should provide publicly available U.S. data for a broad range of economic, financial, and demographic series including:  National income accounts, industrial production, business sales and inventories, employment and unemployment, labor compensation and wages, consumer and producer prices, export and import prices, energy, international transactions, market exchange rates, interest rates, flow of funds, population, and housing.      Data should include available detail and   time series as published under the current   definitions of the series.      Sources for these data should include the   principal U.S. federal statistical agencies   such as:      U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Economic Analysis Bureau of the Census   U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment and Training    Administration   U.S. Department of Energy Energy Information Administration   U.S. Department of Housing and Urban    Development   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve    System   U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service   U.S. Department of Treasury International Revenue Service   U.S. Federal Housing Finance Board      Sources should also include private-sector   organizations including:    The Conference Board University of Michigan National Association of Realtors Mortgage Bankers of American Ward's Automotive News Standard & Poor's Corporation Institute of Supply Management Moody's Investor Service INTERNATIONAL DATA      The offeror should provide publicly   available international data for a range of   economic, financial, and demographic series    including:  national income accounts, industrial   production, employment and unemployment,   consumer and producer prices,   international transactions, market   exchange rates and other financial data,   and population.    Data should include available detail and time series as  published under the current definitions of the series.    Sources for these data should include the national statistical  agencies of at least the following countries and regions:   Canada, Mexico  Japan,     China, Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan  France, Germany, Italy, United  Kingdom  European Union and Euro Zone  Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Columbia, Chile  Sources for these data should also include data sets compiled by international organizations including at least:  International Monetary Fund   International Financial  Statistics   Direction of Trade Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   Main Economic Indicators   World Bank    World Development  Indicators  World Trade Organization  International Trade Statistics  Detailed Requirements for Forecasting and Analysis The Department requires printed forecasts and analyses of current conditions in the U.S. economy. The Department expects all forecasts to be based on similar assumptions of policy behavior and to be mutually consistent.  The Department expects that the forecasts will be based on a well-structured model. Elements required of the service are outlined below. a. The model should be capable of forecasting (at a minimum) the major components of the national income and product accounts in considerable detail, such as consumption expenditures, private domestic investment, the international trade sector, and the government sector. b. Forecasts of wages and prices and a financial sector that are fully integrated with the other sectors of the model.  c. Forecasts of national economic activity over the short run (2 years) and over the long run (10 years).  d. A well-developed industrial sector that provides forecasts of industry sector output, employment, and prices.    e. Monthly reviews that contain a  discussion of the projections and their  justification as well as an analysis of  current economic conditions, including all  policy assumptions and exogenous variables  used in the model.   f. Full documentation for the model should be available if requested, including variable definitions and sources, historical observations for variables in the model, equation specifications, estimation results, known simulation properties, results from any validation testing that has been performed, all simulation levers used to control model performance, and add factors used to improve or alter model results.   

g. The model must be promptly re-estimated following the release of data revisions affecting estimation period variables incorporated in the model.   h. Consulting support from economists or industry specialists and from econometricians familiar with the model must be provided         GENERAL SYSTEMS SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS   The Department must make maximum use of existing equipment to access the offeror's system. Any requirements for hardware and software not now owned by the Department would be an unnecessary, expensive burden.  Communications. The offeror is expected to support accessing data through TCP/IP.  System Response. The offeror must guarantee operation of the main system for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.   Personal Computer Issues. The use of personal computers by component units within the Department varies considerably.  For some units, the availability of software of the offeror's computer system that supports data downloading will be of primary interest.  Virtually all component organizations own IBM PC or compatible machines. The software should run in Windows versions (98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP).  As noted previously, any download software should support a variety of file formats to permit the Department staff to input the data into several different software packages.  Offeror's direct support of the file structure employed by a variety of packages would be welcome, but to preserve flexibility, offeror should support standard PC ASCII, delimited ASCII, DIF, WK1 and XLS formats.  Account Billing Information. To avoid delays in tracking expenditures, the Department requires that each component organization be provided copies of their respective bills.  These copies should be provided in a timely manner. These copies are in addition to those copies offeror will submit with invoices for payment. INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS MUST REQUEST IN WRITING TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE REQUEST FOR QUOTATION AND STATEMENT OF WORK BY AUGUST 26, 2003.  For additional information and instructions, please contact: JEAN HAIRSTON, NOAA, US FAX: 301/713-0808, JEAN.HAIRSTON@NOAA.GOV. PLEASE REFERENCE DG1350-03-RQ-0098(GJH).

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for the Block IV Tomahawk CCLS.  The Contractor shall perform modifications as defined in CMP PUB 4710/10D section 3.3.  In addition, the Contractor shall perform the following on service-life-limited items controlled by CMP PUB 4710/8G2:  regrain of the (1) JCM-14220-001, replacement of the (4) JCM-14175-001 separation nut initiators, and replacement of the (1) JCM-14237-001 EBW initiator.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform these modifications to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing these requirements in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions and Answers are as follows:

1.Earlier this year, Amver investigated the feasibility of automated reporting.  Were the technical requirements successfully met in the tests that were conducted?

Answer:	Yes, the technical requirements were successfully met in the tests that were conducted.

2.Is the Coast Guard willing to pay for the cost of the position reporting?  We are not sure whether this comes under the definition of “software” as used in the Request for Proposal (RFP) mandatory requirement.

Answer:  Position reporting does not come under the definition of “software” as used in mandatory requirement #11.

3.Regarding the “firm fixed unit price estimated quantity contract”, we may not know precisely how many vessels will be customers, particularly if we are active in successfully securing additional customers for Amver.

Answer:	The “fixed unit” would refer to price per delivered report.   We recognize that the message traffic will vary.  We want to see a firm, fixed report cost for each CLIN period proposed. 
 
4.How would we deal with variability in (1) number of vessels that may use automated reporting, and (2) number of times a day that reports could be submitted?

Answer:	(1)  As long as the vessel is identified by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) number within the standard Amver format, Amver will not have a problem.  If a service provider has hundreds of vessels, we do not want the specific automated reporting time of all vessels to be the same.  (2)  Currently Amver receives from 1 – 4 reports a day for some vessels that are reporting weather observations.  If the vessel is not reporting weather observations, then 1 position report per 24 hours is sufficient.

5.As a follow-on to the question about pricing, and in view of these uncertainties, would the Coast Guard (CG) consider pricing that reflects a fixed component plus a variable component tied to the number of customer vessels/number of position reports per day?

Answer:  We will not consider a fixed component plus a variable component.	

6.Iridium maritime equipment is one of the “other” types of shipboard equipment that can generate acceptable Automated Position Reports (APRs).  Would it be possible to e-mail the format required for the APR, as indicated in the mandatory RFP requirement?

Answer:	The established format is available upon request from the U.S. Coast Guard Contracting Officer.  

7.Who will pay for the polling, the CG or the vessel?

Answer:	No firm decision has been made at this time.

8.What is the projected number of vessels that will participate in this tracking program?

Answer:	Since AMVER is a voluntary system used solely for Search and Rescue, we will not state any projections on number of vessels.

9.Please provide any socio-economic requirements/benefits for this solicitation.

Answer:	This solicitation is full and open competition.  There are no socio-economic requirements/benefits.

10.Request that the solicitation response date be extended beyond August 18, 2003 to allow for a high-quality, compliant proposal.

Answer:	Proposals are due no later than 5 PM, Monday, August 18, 2003.  No further questions will be accepted.

11.Is the management of the Amver website that accepts APRs part of the RFP scope?

Answer:	No

12.What are the systems the Contractor is expected to receive input from—Inmarsat, GPS, AIS, Others?

Answer:	There are no restrictions and no specific system(s) will be dictated in receipt of Automated Position Reports (APR’s).  However, the APR’s must be provided to Amver via email in the standard IMO format.

13.What forms of Inmarsat is Contractor required to use, be compatible with, or from which APRs will be accepted?

Answer:	Again, APR’s must be provided to Amver via email in the standard IMO format in plain text with no attachments.  The method it is received from the ship does not matter.

14.What is the equipment or system definition of a “suitably equipped vessel” as denoted in the RFP?

Answer:	The Coast Guard is not imposing any particular equipment standards on the ship.  However, the report must accurately reflect the required data for the ship.

15.Is the Contractor required to process inputs currently being received via Amver/Seas compressed message, JF radio telex via USCG, HF radio, telex, or telefax?

Answer:	No

16.APRs sent via Amver/seas compressed message appear to go NOAA.  How do they get to Amver?

Answer:	NOAA/NWS forwards the stripped weather OBS to AMVER via email in our standard format.

17.Is each APR report sent to Amver based on data for a single ship update only or can APRs be bundled or batched for multiple ships and sent as a single e-mail report.

Answer:	Amver will work with the service provider.  If the service provider uses bundled/batched multiple ship reports, it will be acceptable, provided the IMO format is used.

18.If the Amver program is voluntary, how is the requirement for an APR every 24 hours enforced with participating ships?

Answer:	There is no enforcement for providing APR’s.  Those vessels participating in AMVER realize that reporting at least every 24 hours increases the response/assistance capabilities of Amver resources.

19.Are there any information assurance requirements, and if so, what are they?

Answer:  There are no specific security requirements for delivery of reports to Amver.
	
20.There are two dates listed in the RFP, 15 August and 18 August.  Which is correct and binding?

Answer:  See Question 10.

21.From which shipping companies or vessel tracking service companies is the Contractor required to solicit Automated Position Reports (APRs) and vessel position information?

Answer:	Amver is a voluntary system and does not mandate APRs from shipping companies or vessel tracking companies.  The Coast Guard is always looking for ways to expand the participation of ships in Amver.

22.Does the Coast Guard have existing agreements to get data from satellites?  If so, will we be able to leverage existing Coast Guard resources to obtain data via satellite going forward?

Answer:	Among the many current methods to obtain reports for Amver is the “Amver/SEAS” compressed message software for reports from ships via Inmarsat-C and then delivered by email. This was created in support of the Amver system and the gathering of weather data by NOAA. This option is available to companies that would be willing to make the needed software changes at their land earth stations, make contractual arrangements with the Coast Guard and NOAA, and assist in developing their own user base.

23.What are the existing processes for getting data from ships/shipping companies into the Amver database?

Answer:	All PRs come into the Amver system via email, Telex routed via AT&T, or HF routed via Coast stations.  Faxed reports are emailed from the Amver fax server to amver.com.  Amver also exchanges report information daily with JASREP, AUSREP, and CHILREP.

24.Does a specification exist for Amver database inputs?  How is that specification conveyed/communicated to ships and shipping companies?

Answer:	The Amver standard format is internationally established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and made available to all countries. In addition to IMO documents, the U.S. publishes this information via the web site www. amver.com, the document called Amver Bulletin and promoted by Coast Guard staff at its Headquarters in Washington DC and the Amver Maritime Relations staff in New York, New York.

25.What is meant by a firm-fixed unit price estimated quantity contract?  What will be the basis for determining how the price is negotiated and how work will be awarded and authorized?

Answer:	See Question 3.

26.Our understanding is that the work scope in involves getting information in an e-mail format in to the Amver database.  What is meant by automation of product when inputting data into Amver database?

Answer:	That is the process the Amver system goes through to validate the accuracy of the position report before it is committed to the database.  If the APRs are in the required Amver IMO standard format, the data should be automatically inputted into the Amver database.

27.Is the Coast Guard interested in understanding the location of vessels throughout the world or specific regions only?

Answer:	Amver is the only global ship reporting system.  Location information worldwide and regional is acceptable, though worldwide is preferred.

28.Is there a minimum sized vessel the Coast Guard is interested in tracking?

Answer: No, any vessels that want to report and can be called upon for SAR assistance can participate. SAR assistance by Amver is generally viewed as ocean going vessels with 2-way communications connectivity to shore-side SAR services and able to assist at the scene of a distress in the ocean.

29.How does the Coast Guard currently address language differences between when receiving data into the system?

Answer:	Under IMO standards, English is the reporting language.

30.Do we need to consider the sharing of information in the Amver database with other internationally-recognized rescue coordination centers around the world?  Also, do we nee to consider a method of obtaining information from other Coast Guards for incorporation into the Amver database?

Answer:	No, to ensure security for this sensitive data, only USCG RCCs provide Amver information (Surpics) surface picture to other Coast Guards around the world, and only for SAR purposes.  You will not be tasked with obtaining information from other Coast Guards.

31.Does a website exist that contains all of the questions and responses submitted by potential bidders under this RFP?  If so, how do we gain access?  If not, is there a way to gain access to questions submitted by other potential bidders and their responses?

Answer:	Questions and answers from all potential vendors will be posted at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

32.Will the USCG consider granting an extension to the RFP due date?

Answer:	See Question #10.

This can    be:   * an existing published wage determination   * a survey underlying a wage determination   * a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a     position on a wage determination matter   * a conformance (additional classification and rate)     ruling   On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests   for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour   Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted   because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the   Davis-Bacon survey program.  If the response from this initial   contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)   and 3.) should be followed.   With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal   process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch   of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations        Wage and Hour Division        U. S. Department of Labor        200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.        Washington, D. C.  20210   2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an   interested party (those affected by the action) can request   review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator   (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:             Wage and Hour Administrator             U.S. Department of Labor             200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.             Washington, D. C.  20210   The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the   interested party's position and by any information (wage payment   data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the   requestor considers relevant to the issue.   3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an   interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review   Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:             Administrative Review Board             U. S. Department of Labor             200 Constitution Avenue, N. W.             Washington, D. C.  20210   4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.               END OF GENERAL DECISION

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment No. A004 is to provide additional information concerning the portable antenna project based on more questions received from prospective sources and changes/revisions in the Government's requirements.  QUESTION:  Is the Gortex De-Ice shield heated or unheated?  ANSWER:  The Gortex De-Ice shield is unheated.  QUESTION:  What power level is required for the Anacom Ku-Band transceiver?  ANSWER:  50 watts minimum (This was already addressed in A001.)  QUESTION:  What features are needed on the SDM 300A Modems?  ANSWER:  EF Data SDM 300A Modems (no substitute) optioned for Turbo Product Code, Reed Solomon, Viterbi and Drop and Insert, Data Rate 1.544 (T-1)  (NOTE:  This is a change from the information provided in A001 regarding Turbo Product Code, Reed Solomon, and Viterbi.)  QUESTION:  What brand and model of dummy load?  ANSWER:  The Government requires fully integrated KU Dummy load rated for transceiver +20%.  QUESTION:  What kind of spectrum analyzer is needed and what is the desired operational frequency range of the analyzer?  ANSWER:  Textronics or Hewlett Packard, as long as the proposed spectrum analyzer can be used on the 70 MHZ IF side and be capable of up to 2 GHZ.  QUESTION:  Can the handheld terminal requirement for the transceiver control be a laptop computer with serial interface?  ANSWER:  No, the Government wants a handheld terminal, not a laptop.  QUESTION:  Does the Government require/desire rack mount case for the two satellite modems?  ANSWER:  Yes, the Government requires a rack mount case for the two satellite modems.  The second modem is to be mounted in the case with the first modem as a cold spare, but rear accessible for switching cables from the primary.  QUESTION:  Does the Government require 70 MHz IF distribution and independent transmit and receive IF level control with IF Tx/Rx monitoring?  ANSWER:  Yes, this is a requirement of the Government.  QUESTION:  Is transceiver RF output switching between the transceiver and antenna required on both C-Band and Ku-Band systems?  ANSWER:  Yes, this is a requirement of the Government.  QUESTION:  Regarding the 2.4 meter antenna Transit Cases, the required antenna system structure, 24SFK2L, has eight cases with one extra case for each feed for a total of eleven cases just for the antenna system.  The RFQ mentions four transit cases.  Will the total number of cases be a problem?  Is there a weight size limit on any of the cases?  ANSWER:  The total number of cases is not a problem and there is not a specific weight limit.  The requirement is that the system have adequate shipping cases for transporting the disassembled satellite system easily and conveniently.  The system must have easy deployment (i.e., 2 person assembly, captive hardware, precision alignment).  QUESTION:  Does the Government require a shipping case for each transceiver package?  ANSWER:  The Government does not require a shipping case for each transceiver package, but the Government does require to have the KU equipment divided from the C equipment.  COMBINED QUESTIONS:  Does the Government have specifications or the name of the original manufacturer of the requested components for this requirement?  The description calls for a detailed list of items the Government is requesting the successful Contractor to supply, including the exact length of a piece of waveguide.  Is it the intention of the Government to buy all the listed items in the solicitation only or to have a general Contractor to supply a complete working satellite system terminal that uses these listed parts as a "guide?"  ANSWER:  The items that require a specific model and/or manufacturer have previously been specified in the RFQ and preceding amendments (i.e., the 2.4M Antenna Vertex 24SFK2L and the EF SDM 300 A modems).  The successful Contractor must also provide for the portable satellite system one EA On-Call Communications Single Carrier Per Channel (SCPC) Voice Order Wire, consisting of Microphase MP-1040 modulator, Microphase MP-2030S demodulator and On-Call Communications SCS-3 voice intercom unit, or an approved or equal Voice Order Wire.
QUESTION:  How can any general Contractor be responsible for the antenna's performance under windy conditions which the Government also specified as must being met in the RFQ?  ANSWER:  If the offeror provides the Vertex 2.4 meter antenna, Model 24SFK2L, as specified, that model is rated to withstand the winds specified in the RFQ.  QUESTION:  Will the Government accept some other 2.4 meter Ku Band flyaway terminal design that uses the Government speicified electronics packages?  ANSWER:  The Government will not accept any other flyaway antenna than the one specified in the RFQ (i.e., the Vertex 2.4 Model 24SFK2L).  The ease of shipment of this particular satellite system is a mandatory part of the requirement.  Descriptions for items for which the RFQ and amendments do not list a specific model and/or manufacturer are intended to be "guides" and offerors can propose "or equal" products.  In order for the Government to make a determination of the proposed "or equal" products, the offerors MUST provide descriptive literature, consisting of catalog cuts, specs, etc. that adequately describe the proposed "or equal" product.  If an offeror fails to provide said descriptive literature for the "or equal" products, their proposal will be rejected since the Government will not be in a position to fairly evaluate the proposed "or equal" product to determine the product's capability to meet the Government's minimum requirements.  The delivery time period specified in the original RFQ is changed from 30-45 days after receipt of order is now changed to 60-90 days after receipt of order.  As stated in A003, the date for receipt of offers is now changed to 19 August 2003, 4:00 PM/EST.  This is the last amendment and no further questions will be entertained by the Government.  END OF AMENDMENT NO. A004 TO RFQ NO. EMV-2003-RQ-0042.

The overall estimated price range is between $5M and $10M.  The  Base Line Item is estimated between $1M and $5M, and the two Option Line Items  are estimated between $1M and $5M (combined).  The NAICS Code is 236220.  The  size standard is $28.5M.  This is a RESTRICTED procurement for 8(a) Small  Business Concerns certified in Region 5, Kentucky, West Virginia, and  Pennsylvania.  This is in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness  Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note).

The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a **domino effect** which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations.

(2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Acquisition and Grants Group is seeking capability statements from small and minority business firms who are qualified to contract for design, data collection, and perform data preparation. The intent of this publication/announcement/solicitation is to reach and encourage as many small and minority business firms as possible to compete for CMS?s current programs.  CMS needs comprehensive and timely information on the health care use, costs, and characteristics of its Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, this survey measures health care utilization, expenditures, insurance coverage and associated variables in a representative sample of the persons served by the Medicare program.  This effort is pursuant to the fourth Functional Statement for the Office, published in the Federal Register (Vol. 62, No.85,p.24121-2, May 2, 1997):  Small and minority businesses are invited to submit capability statements electronically to Jbarnes2@cms.hhs.gov or by mail to: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services AGG/Division of Research Contracts and Grants 2-21-15 Central Building, 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD  21244-1850.  Qualified firms should have expertise in at least some of the following specific data analysis areas listed below.  These activities require that the contractor must have, or must be able to acquire under the terms and conditions of its contractual agreement, the resources and expertise to perform these functions on an almost immediate basis.  This role will require designs and conduct research and evaluations of health care programs, studying their impacts on beneficiaries, providers, plans, States, and other partners and customers, designing and assessing potential improvements, and developing new measurement tools. This role will also require environmental scanning, identifying, evaluating, and reporting emerging trends in health care delivery and financing and their interactions with Agency programs.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to contract for design, data collection, and data preparation to continue the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a multi-year survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare Beneficiaries.  Interviews for the MCBS have been conducted three times a year since 1991, using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technology.   Data will be validated and weighted to produce national and regional estimates and to serve as a research database.  Quick turnaround of high quality data will be emphasized for use in formulating national policy. This is not a formal solicitation.  Concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above. Sources possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the above are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the required services.  Information furnished should include background information, resumes, a description of general and specific facilities, and an outline of previous similar projects, and other available literature for the CMS to perform a proper evaluation.  Interested small businesses may submit these tailored capability statements to the attention of the Contract Specialist at the address above no later than 10 calendar days from date of this publication.

<RESPDATE>082603
<ARCHDATE>10252003
<CONTACT>Sue Werner, 256-895-1170
<DESC>NA This is a sources sought synopsis.  The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville has a requirement for furnishings and related support services to provide clinical and administrative workspaces through an Integrated Modular Medical Support Syst em (IMMSS) contract for the United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Contractor must demonstrate the ability to provide furnishings sales, support services, equipment and warranty support to furnish clinical areas in Army medic al facilities (AMF) or Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) in CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Administrative systems and freestanding furnishings, seating, and accessories are also required.  Additional responsibilities include warranty support, installation s ervices, transportation, storage and extended support services for a IMMSS.  A more defined scope shall be included in the proposed contract under the statement of services.  In general terms, the Contract will be applicable to all Army Medical Treatment F acilities (MTFs) throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and Overseas (OCONUS).  OCONUS locations will include, but not limited to Puerto Rico, Korea, Japan and Germany.  The facilities basic functions are broad and support (but not limited to): h ospitals, medical and health clinics, dental clinics, veterinarian clinics, administrative and logistical facilities, it may further include areas for research, development, training and medical warehouse.  The IMMSS shall furnish, as needed, all the follo wing prescribed areas:  administrative, clinical, healthcare materials management and handling systems, pharmacy, laboratory, and nurse stations.  The proposed product/s must be flexible with retrospect to the design intent and interior layout of the furni ture and interface with both new and/or existing sub-components and furthermore the product should not require modification or special tools for assembly.  In addition all components shall be easily replaceable in the field.  The products must be durable, maintainable, and provide considerations for safety features.  All products must be approved and accepted for standard use by medical healthcare professionals.  Quality shall be consistent throughout the lifecycle in all components of the product and servi ce.  All textiles and office environment products available on the IMMSS contract must be proven to have been tested for indoor air quality emissions and therefore meet acceptable indoor air quality guidelines specified by the Environmental Protection Agen cy.  To assure interchangeability and adjustability, products shall be mountable on panels, horizontal wall rails, interface rails and vertical wall supports.  A complete product-line must be readily available which will accommodate the needs of the entire  organization, from the multi-occupancy storage and dispensing, medical/clinical laboratory configurations, healthcare materials management, as well as nurses stations.  Component systems from different component manufacturers are allowed, provided the sub -components are directly interchangeable without modification of custom adaptation and the characteristics and features of the multiple product lines must meet or exceed that of the designated primary product line. (For example, drawers from an administrat ive component system shall fit into the pharmacy or nurse station component system; healthcare materials management drawers shall fit into lab configurations and nurses stations.)  In an effort to eliminate product obsolescence due to the revolving medical  mission and demands of the technical environment the requirement for the interface, including compatible fabrics and finishes, of new component systems to existing systems is a mandatory requirement.  (For example, an exam room must be able to be converte d into a doctor's office and vice versa). IMMSS contractor shall provide support services, ancillary, but necessary, to the successful furnishing of the clinica l and administrative spaces, such as:  Design Services, Warranty and Product Protection Services, Restorative Services, KIN Maintenance Service, Project Management and Extended Installation Services.  Contractor shall provide subject matter experts to revi ew, document, suggest work flow, space management, clinical and functional analysis services.  Contractor shall be capable of providing design of accessories and IMMSS products that comply with local seismic requirements, as well as providing the installat ion necessary to meet seismic requirements due to project location.  IMMSS Contractor shall be capable of providing an interactive website allowing Army MEDCOM facilities worldwide to access product pricing and service fees, information and details about t he IMMSS contract, JSN & typical workstation configurations and catalog cuts of product must be available. Contractor shall provide at least 5 years warranty for the subcomponent systems and standard manufactur's products.  Also, Contractor shall provide f or continuity warranty of product availability and service for a period of 5 years after installation. It is intended that this contract will be awarded for a period of 5 years (base year and four options years).  It is intended that this contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that allows for placement of firm-fixed price orders.  The Government fully intends to set-aside a portion of the services for small business.  Sources are being sought for firms with a North Ameri can Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 423450 for medical furnishings wholesaling.  However if two or more small qualified businesses demonstrate the cability to meet all requirements, the requirement will be set-aside for small buesinesses.  F or small businesses to qualify under these NAICS codes, the firm must have 500 or fewer employees.  For any large business award, a subcontracting plan showing the firm's ability to meet the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's Small Business sub-contracting targ ets of 43.8% to Small Business must be provided for the Contracting Officer's signature prior to award. All firms whom express interest in providing the items requested under the proposed contract must have capacity to dedicate a single point of contact fo r execution of this work.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Prototype Insect Rearing Racks
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratory (ABADRL)intends to enter into a sole source contract with Britz-Heidbrink, Inc., Wheatland, Wyoming.  This contract is to procure four prototype insect rearing racks which are in the developmental stages in the study concerning colonization and large-scale rearing of a biting midge conducted at ABADRL, who are key to investigations concerning the role of this insect as a vector of several viral pathogens of veterinary importance in the United States, notably the bluetongue (BTV) viruses, epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses, and vesicular stomatitis viruses.  These prototype racks are only available to USDA, ARS, ABADRL and are not currently available to the public.  This effort has been an ongoing effort as the demand for large numbers of laboratory-rearing insects has required development of more efficient and economical techniques and insectary equipment due to the need to replace obsolete racks.  Many aspects of this product are related directly to the specific research at ABADRL.

This phase will involve treatment for ceiling and wallcoverings that will allow failed plaster beneath the papers to be repaired.   Heugh-Edmondson has done an analysis of the ceiling and wallcovering conditions at the Truman Home during the first phase and is very qualified and familiar with the project.  It is the best interest of the Government to maintain this company.  It is anticipated that the resultant project will be a firm fixed price.  This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued.  An award is anticipated on or about September 3, 2003.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Space Based Radar Concept/System Development Industry Day Conference
<DESC>(a) On August 22, 2003 from 0800 until 1230 PDT, interested parties are invited to attend an Industry Day Conference conducted by the government program representatives to address the goals and contractual objectives of the Space Based Radar (SBR) System. SBR is an ACAT 1D program currently entering Acquisition Phase A as defined in NSS 03-01. The Space Based Radar Program is administered by Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (AFSPC/SMC) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), in coordination with the Services and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).  The Space-Based Radar (SBR) system is a transformational system for the DoD and the Intelligence Community that will provide persistent global collection of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) products.  The system will have the following core capabilities: collect Surface Moving Target Indication (SMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, and High-Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) data; exploit space and ground communications systems to move collected data from space to ground; process and disseminate collected data to support both national and theater BMC3 systems. (b) The JPO will be beginning the process of awarding a concept development contract that will allow development of the system through the Increment 1. The acquisition strategy is to conduct a best value, progressive competition/down-selection. The source selection will result in the award of one or possibly two contracts with performance through System Design Review (SDR) plus six months.  The formal RFP will be issued in Oct 03 by the SBR Joint Program Office (JPO) at Space and Missile Systems Center. Proposals will be due 45 days later with an anticipated contract award date in Mar 04. If one contract is awarded, the contract will be a cost-plus award fee arrangement. If two contracts are awarded, the contract will be a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement. At the development milestone of SDR, the Government will request a Call for Improvement (CFI) proposal. This CFI will be used to conduct and evaluate a progressive down-selection intended to identify the single contractor offering the superior (best value) design approach to continue the development and manufacture of the SBR system. It is anticipated that only those contractors participating in the preceding phase will be capable of successfully competing for the next phase contract awards, although other offerors will not be precluded from consideration at the down-selection decision point. (c) The contractors will be required to submit a priced proposal for the first phase of this effort through SDR plus six months, and evidence of affordability of the total system. This will allow the Government to judge best value through SDR and judge the affordability of the system. While the Government intends to down-select at the System Design Review (SDR), we reserve the right not to, and either extend the parallel development effort to a future down-selection milestone or to proceed with a full and open competition if that approach is determined to be in the Government's best interest. (d) The schedule for the Industry Day Conference is as follows: 1) Registration 2) Director’s Welcome 3) Acquisition and RFP Overview 4) Question and Answer Session. The conference will take place in Building A-8 of the Aerospace Corporation Complex, 2350 E. El Segundo Bl., El Segundo CA 90245. Seating is limited; therefore, each contractor will be limited to five (5) representatives. The conference will be held at the DoD Unclassified level. Parties planning to attend should email or fax their reservations by the close of business Wednesday, August 20th, to:  Lt. Geoffrey Eaton at geoffrey.eaton@losangeles.af.mil or fax (310) 363-2522 or to Lt. Gena Thorn at gena.thorn@losangeles.af.mil. Information in the reservation should include the names(s) of each person attending, citizenship, phone number and company name.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Request for Information (RFI) - M-X Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)
<DESC>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - Alternatives and Designs for an Advanced Special Operations Forces (SOF) Air Mobility (M-X) Platform 

SUSPENSE: Submit written responses by 4:00 p.m. CST on 29 Aug 2003.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  In May 2003, HQ AFSOC awarded a contract to the Unified and Special Operations Group of Jacobs Sverdrup Technology, Inc., to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for an Advanced Special Operations Forces (SOF) Air Mobility Platform, herein called the M-X.  To facilitate an exhaustive evaluation of all possible alternatives to fill the M-X requirement, this Request for Information (RFI) solicits information from all companies who believe they could perform as a prime contractor to design, develop, build prototype(s), conduct developmental and operational testing, and produce end items to meet an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of 2018.   

DATA/INFORMATION REQUESTED.  Private sector industry is invited to submit written design, performance, and cost information regarding the requirements below.  The written response should contain a point of contact for follow-up communication.  Please indicate any willingness for follow-up briefings at your facility or a Government facility.  We are asking that each potential prime contractor provide us, and our AoA contractor, with detailed information on all alternatives they believe to be viable.  It is the Government’s intention to provide all information obtained via this RFI to the AoA contractor who will be responsible for conducting appropriate AoA-related performance, survivability, and cost modeling; and to document the analysis and recommendations in an AoA final report.  Background information and security clearance information concerning our AoA contractor is available upon request and non-disclosure agreements will be executed as required.  The Government requests each respondent provide sufficient technical and cost related information so the viability of each alternative or design can be fully considered.  Technical information should include shape, weight, range, speed, payload (weight and cube), offensive and defensive avionic subsystems and their performance assessments, communication/situational awareness subsystems, detectability characteristics (Radar Cross Section (RCS), IR, visible, ultraviolet, audibility), Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) / Ultra-Short Take-off and Landing (USTOL) characteristics, landing zone performance, all estimated mission and system reliability / maintainability / human factors performance, and obsolescence projections.  Identify the representative infil / exfil missions and concept of operations where the proposed design would be successful, or most successful.  Identify an acquisition strategy (RDT&E, Procurement, and Military Construction) and sustainment strategy (O&S) to include cost, schedule, and technical risks to reach an IOC in 2018.  For purposes of this RFI, assume four production M-X along with logistics, training, facilities, etc., constitutes IOC.  Identify impacts on manpower, training, training materials, training systems, logistics/supportability, facilities and any other related category.  Request cost information be provided in both Base Year FY 04 and in Then Year.  For this RFI only, calculate development costs, production costs (to include learning curves and first units), operating and support costs, disposition costs, and other costs in terms of a 20 year operational life and the following total quantities:  10, 25, 50, 100.  In addition, provide the ground rules, assumptions, and program schedule used to calculate the costs.  The Government along with its AoA Contractor will acknowledge receipt of all information, and will notify each provider regarding which alternative/design provided is of interest.  For those designs of interest, the Government and its AoA contractor may solicit additional dialogue with that provider to flesh out details.  

The Government and its AoA contractor will abide with any “Proprietary” or “Other Markings” placed on information provided.  

THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOR DOES IT CONSTITUTE A CURRENT OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT.  ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE GOVERNMENT IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  ALL DATA PROVIDED TO, OR CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OR ITS AOA CONTRACTOR IS PURELY VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE PROVIDER AND AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  

BACKGROUND ON THE M-X REQUIREMENT - AFSOC has worldwide responsibility for the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Mobility mission area, which includes rapid, global airlift and recovery of personnel and equipment through hostile or denied airspace to conduct special clandestine operations.  AFSOC’s capabilities must accommodate all operational and physical environments, especially at night, at low altitude, in adverse weather, and over all terrain.  Historically, SOF’s niche has been to go where no one else can go, do what no one else can do, and return undetected.  The exponentially increasing capabilities and arrays of threats to aircraft and ground forces will make this a difficult niche in which to maintain a robust capability in the 2018-2030 timeframe.  By 2018, for instance, AFSOC believes that a new capability, the M-X, will be required to provide the President and the Secretary of Defense a full range/spectrum of options for employment of SOF.  The M-X is envisioned to provide SOF with an enhanced air mobility capability in denied or hostile airspace.  It should be able to conduct undetected infiltration/exfiltration (infil/exfil) penetration of sophisticated integrated air defense systems, and possess the speed/range/defensive systems to survive if detected.  This enables SOF to be airlifted deep into and out of defended airspace and provides SOF the critical element of tactical surprise by reducing the time between detection, target engagement, and exfiltration.  Minimizing time between detection and SOF actions is key to successful special operations and reduces the time enemy forces have to counter SOF operations.  The M-X needs to have “agility in the objective area”.  USTOL over a 50-foot obstacle, is desired, and VTOL, at mid-mission weights or better is highly desired.  The V/USTOL capability gives SOF greater freedom of operations to take off and land in austere locations and objective areas closer to SOF targets.  This also reduces the need for additional force protection assets and extended cross-country maneuver vehicles to support SOF operations.  The V/USTOL capability reduces SOF’s dependence on large runways and the need for two-stage operations where troops or equipment are transferred to or from rotary-wing to fixed-wing aircraft.  The future M-X should have greater speed and range than current aircraft to rapidly deploy SOF anywhere, anytime. The M-X represents new capabilities and is not intended to be a “follow-on” C-130-type aircraft.  The M-X should fill the SOF niche described above by greatly exceeding the capabilities of the MC-130 and CV-22, not replacing either.  It is intended that the M-X will be part of a Family of Aircraft designed to fill a variety of missions requiring low detectability and/or high survivability such as advanced cargo transport, advanced tanker, and future gunship.  By the proposed M-X IOC date of 2018, the assumption is all MH-53 aircraft are retired and the existing fleet of MC-130 and CV-22 aircraft will be supplemented by a TBD number of M-X aircraft.  In general, the MC-130/CV-22 aircraft will accomplish operations in lightly defended and/or permissive airspace, and the M-X aircraft will accomplish operations in moderate to highly defended and/or non-permissive airspace.  Key M-X design considerations include:  1) In-flight refuel capability so it can conduct operations anywhere in the world within 48 hours when staged from bases in the US; 2) Maximize payload size and weight; 3) high probability of zero detection by an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) for both airland and airdrop missions; 4) high probability of surviving threat system engagements if detected; 5) high reliability to insure mission completion without intermediate stops for maintenance; 6) high cruise speeds at altitude and low level, MC-130H speeds at the minimum, airliner speeds preferred; 7) high probability of successful take-off and landing on unimproved landing areas and ability to turn around on the ground in minimum distance; 8) fully interoperable with Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Command and Control Information Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR); and 9) fully compatible with current and projected National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) products and capabilities.

<SUBJECT>A -- HIGH-THROUGHPUT PROTEIN PRODUCTION SCREENING
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE HIGH-THROUGHPUT PROTEIN PRODUCTION SCREENING TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL’s high-throughput protein production screening technology.  

Scientists at LLNL have developed a complete system for examining protein production in a cell-free environment from many genes. Starting with a set of cDNA clones or a library (or genomic-DNA for prokaryotic organisms), protein production analysis can be completed in less than 8 hours. The technique can be performed on many different genes at a time (multiples of 96), and is readily automated. 

The procedure has a number of distinct advantages over existing technology. First, the procedure is fast, as it requires no bacterial growth or subcloning. Second, some proteins can be expressed in the RTS but only at low levels in vivo expression systems such as E. coli. The system can be used with non-T7 promotor based clones using a two-step PCR procedure to incorporate the necessary T7 regulatory elements. Finally, the system involves no living cells, therefore, has applications in examining proteins from disease-causing microorganisms or other bioterrorism agents. 

This protein expression screening is of potential value to proteomics and structural genomics efforts, which require large numbers or large quantities of protein. LLNL’s flexible, high-throughput protein expression screen allows rapid analysis of many proteins and many of the steps can be easily automated. A rapid, automated screening method dramatically reduces the cost of analyzing protein expression.  The process has been developed for parallel processing of 96 samples, but can be extended to work in a 384 well format. This procedure has the potential to examine protein expression from large cDNA collections such as the LLNL IMAGE collection.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's protein production screening technology should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

 
Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 000051-03.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's protein production screening technology.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aeronomy Laboratory, requires a pulsed, Nd:YAG laser system for use in chemical kinetics experiments.  The application for this laser system is for the photolysis of precursors to produce radicals of interest (e.g., OH, HCO, SH, Cl, etc.) in atmospheric chemistry.  As such, the laser must produce pulses of both visible and ultraviolet light with enough energy to
produce sufficient quantities of these radicals.  A Nd:YAG laser is well suited to this purpose since it produces laser pulses at wavelengths of 532 nanometers (nm) in the visible and at 355 and 266 nm in the ultraviolet.  The system will be used with a number of different, fixed experiments, and must therefore be small in size and must not require external water connections the hinder portability. ****  Critical specifications for the system are: (1) Pulse energy @ 355 nm:   120 millijoules (mJ); (2) Pulse energy @ 266 nm:  75 mJ ;  (3)  Laser head size (L x W x H): ¾ 36" x 10" x 10"    (these dimensions should include harmonic separators); (4)  Laser power supply size (L x W x H): ¾ 24" x 12" x 24" ;  (5)  Power supply must be air cooled with no external water connections; (6) Power supply must run on standard 110-120 volt power. **** Standard Specifications: (1)  Pulse duration:  < 10 nanoseconds (ns); (2) Repetition rate:  10 Hertz (Hz);  (3)  Pulse to pulse energy stability @ 532 nm: ¾ 4%; (4)  Power drift @ 532 nm: ¾ 5%; (4)   Beam divergence: < 0.5 milliradians (mrad); (5)  Pointing stability: < 50 microradians ( rad);  (6)  Beam Qaulity @ 532 nm:  90% fit to Gaussian, far field   ****  In addition to these specifications, we expect that the system will carry a minimum warranty of 1 year on parts and 90 days on optics, better if possible, and must be easily serviceable within the United States. *** The award will be based upon "best value" considering both price and technical merit, with technical merit being evaluated according to the standards of FAR 13.106.

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered, your proposal shall address fully all above items and must include details on the following:

Monitoring – a complete list of the broadcasts (and languages) which would be initially available, how these signals will be accessed, and broadcasts most likely to be added in future expansion. 

Transcription and translation – a list of languages which are currently available for transcription and translation, and languages which might be added in the near future; a detailed description of the method used for transcription and translation; the estimated time between broadcast, transcription and translation; and the level of accuracy/quality for transcription and translation.

Details related to the set up, maintenance and retrieval of user profiles, email alerts or other monitoring tools, including the location of storage of selected clips (host system server or user system).

Time frame for the availability of this service and possible expansion.

Previous experience of your firm in providing this or similar services.

Qualifications of the project manager and other staff who would be assigned to the project.

If your firm is unable to meet certain of the above requirements, please propose alternatives.


EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

Any firm capable of providing these services may submit a proposal in response to this announcement.   To be considered, your proposal must be received at the following address  no later than 12:00 noon (local time), August 26, 2003. 

Please prepare and submit proposals in two separate parts.  The first part, a narrative "technical proposal," should detail your approach to satisfying our requirements.   It must also address any background and experience your firm and its personnel have in performing similar or related work.  This section will be reviewed by Department program personnel in need of this service.

The second part, a "business proposal," must provide a detailed breakdown of anticipated/proposed costs, explaining how your firm arrived at its final contract price.  This section will be reviewed independently of the "technical proposal" by the Department's contracting office.  Be sure your price proposal accounts for each of the four option years.  When pricing the initial pilot period, please provide pricing information for both six and twelve months of service.

Proposals for this project will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria in addition to price:  quality and capability of the proposed service, and ability to provide  services in a timely fashion.  For evaluation purposes, technical merit will be weighted more heavily than price-related factors. 

Please fax, e-mail, or deliver your proposal and direct any questions to:
