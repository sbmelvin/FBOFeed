<SUBJECT>A -- FLIGHT TEST DEMONSTRATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS WIDE AREA SEARCH MINITURE MUNITION WITH TWO-WAY DATA LINK CAPABILITY

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Assessment and Demonstrations Division (AFRL/MNA) intends to issue a request for proposal for an FY03-FY05 flight test demonstration of a semi-autonomous wide area search miniature munition conducting a mission against mobile ground targets (Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Armor). A Note 22 Synopsis (MNK-03-0004) was posted in Fed Biz Ops on 5 Feb 03 requesting statements of capability.  Submittals were evaluated and results have been forwarded to the respondents.   A notional demonstration will consist of the tactical configured munition (wings stowed, engine off) launched from a Contractor furnished test aircraft, post launch wing deployment and engine start, and fly out under GPS/INS waypoint guidance to two designated search areas.  The munition will be linked to a number of simulated munitions to conduct cooperative attack real-time assessment.  The munition and simulated munitions will initiate search in the first area for targets, using an onboard LADAR seeker utilizing real-time autonomous target acquisition (ATA) algorithms to discriminate and properly identify (ID) TMD, SEAD, and armor target vehicles while rejecting non target vehicles.  As the munition detects and identifies target vehicles it will transmit its ID/Location/BIT and the detected target ID/Location/Time to a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operator.  BIT may include information such as GNC and ATA acceptable error values, in addition to hardware/software and memory health status.  It will also transmit data to the simulated munitions (real-time DIS simulation environment) involved in the cooperative search and attack mission.  If not directed to attack any of the detected target vehicles, the munition will fly to the second search area.  The munition and simulated munitions will then initiate search to detect, discriminate and properly ID TMD, SEAD, and armor target vehicles.  As the munition detects and identifies target vehicles it will again transmit the detected target ID/Location/Time to the HITL operator.  The HITL operator will decide which target to engage and transmit attack authorization to the munition.  The munition will optimize a return profile to the detected target location and begin autonomous search to detect, identify, track, and transmit engagement data (munition ID/Location/BIT and target ID/Location/Time) as it conducts a simulated attack using some means to document the simulated warhead event against a moving target (less than or equal to 25 Mi/Hr) unless directed to abort.  This flight demonstration will be preceded by studies, and ground and captive flight tests in preparation for this demonstration, identified in detail in the paragraphs below.  

While this demonstration is focused on the concept of operations and military utility of a data link application to wide area autonomous search munitions.  The design of the flight test article should be consistent with potential first spiral development at the conclusion of this demonstration.   Critical subsystem component selections while not all demonstrated should be targeted for near term operation in tactical environments.

Specific threshold requirements and technology goal tasks will be fully identified in the complete request for proposal package. Interested parties who wish to receive a full request for proposal package must submit a request with an approved DD Form 2345, Export Controlled DOD Technical Data Agreement to this office at address below.  The estimated date of RFP release is 15 Apr 03. 

The type contract anticipated is Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with a $49M ceiling.  The minimum order will be the initial increment of funds under the first task order, currently estimated at $6.64M. The Government expects $12.9M will be made available to fund the baseline contract effort.  This is an estimate only, not a promise of funding availability.  The tentative funding profile is $6.64M FY03, $5.05M FY 04, and $0.6M FY 05.  The anticipated period of performance is up to 30 months for performance of the baseline effort with up to five-year ordering period for additional technology goal tasks.  Award of this effort will follow the general guidelines and methodology used for a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA). Anticipated award of this effort is early June 03. Submit request within 15 days of publication to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Linda Weisz, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL  32542-6810.  For technical information contact C. Cocchiarella, AFRL/MNAV at (850) 882-4651, ext 3382, for contractual questions contact Linda Weisz, Contract Specialist at (850) 882-4294, ext 3405 or Brenda Soler, Contracting Officer at (850) 882-4294 ext 3206.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) to create a "Blue Ribbon Panel." NASA's Office of Education has a requirement to form a "Blue Ribbon Panel" for the purpose of developing criteria with which to evaluate job applicants for Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" educators. The "Blue Ribbon Panel" should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community (approximately 8-10 individuals). It may include representatives from both the teaching profession and professional education associations.   The product the panel develops must define characteristics of a superior educator and provide types of evidence that one would expect to see in a job application that would demonstrate a high level possession of those characteristics.  The characteristics of a superior educator may be described in terms of competencies, knowledge, skills, abilities and personal traits and other similar attributes.  The evidence that a job candidate possesses these characteristics should be defined in terms of types of educator work experience, extracurricular activities, teaching or educator accomplishments, awards and other similar recognitions, or other quantitative achievement.  The anticipated period of performance for this effort is 5 weeks from award. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 611710 and $6.0M, respectively.  This procurement is being conducted as a total small business set-aside. The anticipated release date of the RFQ is on or about 4/17/2003 with an anticipated quote due date of 4/27/2003. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.	The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=04   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the Advanced Direct Contact Condenser (ADCC), U.S. patents # 5,925,291 and # 6,282,497, hereinafter referred to as “technology”.  The ADCC was developed to improve efficiency, reduce emission treatment costs, and remove non-condensable gases in geothermal power plants.  The ADCC is also applicable to fossil fueled steam/Rankine cycle baseload power plants with dry or wet cooling, commercial air conditioners, and other processes that incorporate a condenser.  When installed in a 110 MW geothermal plant at the Geysers in California, the NREL ADCC increased the plant efficiency by 5% allowing a 17% increase in throughput capacity and cut the emission abatement cost by 50%.  The increase in efficiency, output, and cost reductions resulted in an annual savings of approximately $1 Million and a payback period of less than five years.  Additional technical information is available on the NREL web site at: http://www.nrel.gov.geothermal/ADCC.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive (the ADCC has already been licensed exclusively for the geothermal application) or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research program, a CRADA program, or a Technical Service agreement.    
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity [alternate: organizations interested in commercializing this technology should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology].  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a nondisclosure agreement maybe required prior to further discussions.  A business or product commercialization plan maybe required prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiation.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the Advanced Direct Contact Condenser (ADCC), U.S. patents # 5,925,291 and # 6,282,497, hereinafter referred to as “technology”.  The ADCC was developed to improve efficiency, reduce emission treatment costs, and remove non-condensable gases in geothermal power plants.  The ADCC is also applicable to fossil fueled steam/Rankine cycle baseload power plants with dry or wet cooling, commercial air conditioners, and other processes that incorporate a condenser.  When installed in a 110 MW geothermal plant at the Geysers in California, the NREL ADCC increased the plant efficiency by 5% allowing a 17% increase in throughput capacity and cut the emission abatement cost by 50%.  The increase in efficiency, output, and cost reductions resulted in an annual savings of approximately $1 Million and a payback period of less than five years.  Additional technical information is available on the NREL web site at: http://www.nrel.gov.geothermal/ADCC.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive (the ADCC has already been licensed exclusively for the geothermal application) or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research program, a CRADA program, or a Technical Service agreement.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to award a new contract, the period of  performance of which will be thirty (30) months from date of award, for the  design and prototype development of a Taser Anti-Personnel Munition (TAPM) to  support the Area Denial-to Personnel (AD-P) program to General Dynamics,  Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GDOTS), Redmond WA on a sole source basis under  the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  Rational  being that as GDOTS has developed a TAPM that meets the emerging requirements  of a Hand Emplaced Non-Lethal Munition, it would not be economical nor timely  to compete this requirement given the costs and time necessary for another  contractor to become familiar enough with the TAPM to match the current  technological advancement.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION. The Division of Ocean Sciences, National Science Foundation is seeking a System Integration Contractor (SIC) to provide non-riser drilling ship capability and associated scientific support for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  This will be a successor to the Ocean Drilling Program contract between NSF and Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc.  Budget constraints dictate a two-phased approach to the program effort.  Phase 1 will support the contractor to provide an acceptable vessel capable of scientific drilling operations for the initial program years beginning in mid 2004 without significant government supported modifications.  Phase 2 will require the contractor to acquire and convert a vessel to the enhanced scientific ocean drilling capability that has been identified by the scientific ocean drilling community. An international scientific advisory committee is reviewing proposals for specific drilling projects to be addressed during Phase 1. Information on these proposals can be found at  (www.isas-office.jp/ ).  Prioritization of these proposals is expected to occur in September 2003 and will be used in developing the Phase 1 drilling schedule. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. The SIC will manage the selection, acquisition, and operation of the Phase 1 vessel, and the acquisition and modification of the Phase 2 vessel for scientific drilling, as well as subsequent vessel operations and science support activities.  The SIC will also provide shipboard and shore-based technical staffs to support drilling, laboratory and other scientific activity of 25-30 person scientific teams sponsored separately by the IODP members. The United States Science Advisory Committee has undertaken a detailed study of vessel requirements based on science objectives of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Initial Science Plan, and the results of that study are available on the web at (www.joi-odp.org/USSSP/cdc/default.html).  The converted Phase 2 vessel should be consistent with the required drilling platform characteristics identified therein, and have a useful scientific life-span of 10 years or greater.  The major focus of the Phase 2 conversion will be modifications to provide laboratory spaces for geochemical, geological, geophysical and biological analyses of samples and data.  The efficient recovery of complete coring sections is an essential capability.  Habitability and endurance enhancements to comfortably accommodate cruises up to 2 months duration are also key areas of importance.  Funding of the vessel conversion is expected to occur in CY 2005 and 2006, but will depend on future budget appropriations. SPECIFIC ON-BOARD REQUIREMENTS.

(CDA), 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego California 92123 to upgrade, modify, and test components to the existing Alaska Air Combat Training Systems (ACTS) at Eielson AFB, Alaska and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  CDA, formally Cubic Defense Systems (CDS), has recently (January 2003) completed an upgrade to the existing ACTS under the Alaskan ACTS Upgrade (AAU) program.  The upgrade consisted of modifications to the Control and Computation Subsystem (CCS) software and Advanced Display and Debriefing Subsystem (ADDS) software, installation of Encryption / Decryption Equipment (EDE), Filter Verification Processor (FVP), and Data Merge Device (DMD) hardware and software, and modification to existing P4B Airborne Instrumentation Subsystem (AIS) pods for encryption, data recording, and Global Position System (GPS) tracking.  The AAU Phase II program will build on the recent modifications to the subsystems at Eielson AFB and Elmendorf AFB.  The objectives of the Alaska Air Combat Training System (ACTS) Upgrade (AAU) Phase II Program are to integrate the AIM-120C Weapon Sims, ensure AAU compatibility with upgrades for the F-15 and F-16 Operational Flight Programs (OFP), relocate the EDE and FVP, test and verify all software, and document all changes.  The individual tasks will include:  1) install and integrate the AIM-120C weapon simulation into the CCS computers and all the DMD computers at Eielson AFB and Elmendorf AFB; 2) update all System Operator Console (SOC) menus and all Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) alphanumeric and graphic displays for integration of the AIM-120C mission data, missile fly-out parameters, and intermediate and final missile results; 3) update CCS or EDE/FVP software with AIM-120C Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ) parameters for use in AIM-120C weapons simulation processing; 4) update CCS and DMD software to process AIM-120C parameters for valid shot criteria and for proper shot/kill results in accordance with Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1, Chapter 10); 5) update P4BE pod software to interface with F-15 Suite 4M aircraft, to downlink WMSP 98-01 formats for F-15 Suite 4M, and to record on the P4BE pod Data Recording Device (DRD) the WMSP 98-01 formats for F-15 Suite 4M; 6) update P4BE pod software to interface with F-16 C/D Block 50 Modular Mission Computer (MMC) aircraft, to downlink WMSP 98-01 F-16 MMC formats, and to record on the P4BE pod Data Recording Device (DRD) the WMSP 98-01 F-16 MMC formats; 7) update CCS and DMD software to unpack and process F-15 Suite 4M formats and F-16 MMC formats; 8) update EDE/FVP software to allow downlink format words and data elements to pass to the CCS for weapon simulation processing; 9) relocate the Eielson AFB EDE/FVP to the Cope Thunder Operations Building (CTOB), Room 207; 10) reconnect all EDE/FVP cables to the communication equipment and the CCS; 11) test and verify all software changes to the CCS, SOC, DMD,  ICADS, EDE/FVP, and P4BE pods; 12) test and verify proper operation of the EDE/FVP equipment in its new location; and 13) document all changes in the AAU baseline software documents, Technical Manuals, and drawings.  CDA has the resources to support the AAU Phase II program and is uniquely capable of performing the tasks since they developed, installed, and modified the existing subsystems under the initial AAU program.  Information associated with this effort is unclassified, or classified up to, and including, SECRET.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Kevin Miller, kevin.miller@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5206, FAX (850) 882-3226.

<DESC>United States Government ?V Maritime Administration
Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)
Vessel Defueling/Removal and Tank Cleaning Solutions

Description:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region, maintains ships stowage facilities for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age and contain various amounts of fuels, oil, lubricants, oily water and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. 

MARAD is seeking innovative technical/management approaches to the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and removal of all petroleum products, as well as tank cleaning operations of obsolete vessels. (A complete listing of the vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A. This list of ships is subject to change.)  In addition to conventional fuel removal and disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions are invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology, including, but not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techiques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products.  Note that some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.

Offerors may respond to one or both parts (i.e., defueling and/or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete vessels listed on Attachment A.  Upon award, offerors will be required to identify the types of petroleum products, total quantity of the product, chemical analysis of the product, and the proposed methods of removal for the petroleum products from the vessel and their subsequent transportation to a disposal or recycling facility.  MARAD anticipates that the costs of this project will be partially offset by the resale value of the fuel or petroleum product.

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established two periods, January 27-29, 2003 and May 19-21, 2003, for interested parties to visit the JRRF and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  MARAD requests those interested in visiting the JRRF contact the point of contact (POC) not later than Friday, January 10, 2003 to register for the January 27-29 fleet site visit and not later than Friday, May 2, 2003 to register for the May 19-21 fleet sit visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time for the visit. The JRRF POC is Mr. Mike Bagley (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, e-mail sharon.nesbit@marad.dot.gov.

Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to this PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative technical/management approaches for the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A 
?Y Methodology for identifying the types, total quantity, chemical analysis, as well as the  removal and disposal of the petroleum products
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with fuel removal and/or tank cleaning on obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of technical/management approach for the removal/disposal of petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Economic feasibility of the proposed approach(es) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed methodology for identification and chemical analysis of petroleum products
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed removal/disposal of petroleum products and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the removal/disposal of fuel/petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed technical/management approach(es)

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price. 

The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate the implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as to provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised and are considered confidential.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or all of the proposal(s) to implement the innovative solutions offered.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Lockheed Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D), 1701 W. Marshall Drive, Grand Prairie TX 75051.  LMMFC-D is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  There is a need for an FY03-FY05 flight test demonstration of an autonomous wide area search miniature (less than 100 lbs fueled) munition conducting an armed reconnaissance mission against mobile ground targets (Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Armor).  Demonstration will consist of the tactical configured munition (wings stowed, engine off) launched from test aircraft, post launch wing deployment and air start its engine, and fly out under GPS/INS waypoint guidance to designated search areas.  The munition will initiate search in the first area for targets using an onboard seeker utilizing real-time autonomous target acquisition (ATA) algorithms to discriminate and properly ID mobile relocatable target vehicles.  The munition will transmit its ID/Location/BIT and all detected target ID/Location/Time to a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operator.  It will also transmit data to simulated munitions involved in the cooperative search and attack mission.  HITL operator through an uplink to the munition will direct munitions to second search area.  Munition will initiate search to detect, discriminate and properly ID mobile relocatable target vehicles.  The munition will transmit detected target ID/Location/Time to a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operator who will then direct the munition to engage the desired target vehicle.  Once directed to reengage a previously detected target the munition will optimize search to reengage, identify, track, and transmit engagement data (munition ID/Location/BIT and target ID/Location/Time) as it conducts a simulated attack using some means to document the warhead initiation event against a moving target (40 Km/Hr).  LMMFC-D developed the Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) algorithms under an Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement with AFRL/MN.  The algorithms are proprietary to LMMFC-D.  LMMFC-D is the only company that can accomplish the work to be done for a flight demonstration without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in the continued development of this critical wide area search miniature munition technology. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience with miniature munitions and the wide area autonomous search problem, and their ability to rapidly structure a demonstration flight test program.  The qualification package should include a schedule and description of how the contractor will validate demonstrated mature seeker and Autonomous Target Acquisition (ATA) performance against a variety of different Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD), and armored interdiction targets.  The estimated period of performance for this effort is approximately 36 months.  The tentative funding profile for this effort is estimated at $7.8M FY03, $5.3M FY04, and $0.6M FY05.  Submit within 15 days of publication, to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Linda Weisz, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  For technical information contact C. Cocchiarella, AFRL/MNAV at (850) 882-4651, ext. 3382, for contractual questions contact Linda Weisz, Contracts Specialist at (850) 882-4294, ext. 3405.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Center, (ATC), Core Genotyping Facility (CGF) plans to procure a Sequenom MassARRAY Point instrument on a sole source basis with Sequenom Inc., 3595 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, California, 92121.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Core Genotyping Facility (CGF) is assessing human genetic variation, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and other types of genetic variation (microsatellites, insertion/deletion mutations etc…), in a large number of separate population and family studies initiated by NCI investigators. Currently the CGF is utilizing four major technology platforms to assess human genetic variation: 1) TaqMan™ Fluorescent 5' Nuclease cleavage, 2) Primer Extension detected by Matrix Assisted Laser Deionization/Adsorption - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF), 3) Fluorescent DNA fragment analysis and sequencing detected by automated capillary electrophoresis systems, and 4) MGB Eclipse™ 3' Hybridization Triggered Fluorescence. This instrument will be used in conjunction with the Sequenom MassARRAY MALDI_TOF system. The Sequenom MassARRAY system is a MALDI-TOF based system, which requires biological products to be placed on a small spot on a preformatted proprietary matrix Spectro-Chip made by Sequenom. This chip is then transferred to the mass spectrometer where the MALDI-TOF is determined. The CGF does currently have a 4 inkjet based Nanospotter which can provide the same task, but with much less accuracy and prescision, and use of this Nanospotter instrument has caused contamination problems using the homogenous Mass Extend Protocol.  The CGF requires a high-throughput system designed for rapid dispensing of aqueous-based fluids in the submicroliter range. This rapid spotting must occur on a pre-defined "Spectro-CHIP" from a single 384 microtitre plate in ~ 12 minutes or less. The instrument must utilize a 6 x 4 pin array that endures thousands of spottings and unique pin design that utilizes non-contact sample transfer to preserve MALDI matrix. This instrument must also have an integrated sonicator and tip wash station removing the  risk of contamination ensuring consistent sample transfer, and be able to ensure accurate spotting of every chip. The instrument must posses clear and easy-to-use software, which will minimize training and maximize technician efficiency.  This instrument is necessary for the upgrade to an existing genotyping platform and will serve a critical role in the CGF's genotyping and assay development pipeline, necessary to perform contract genotyping for internal and external investigators. Sequenom Inc., is the only source known to the NCI that can meet the required specifications stated above.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Capability statements and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient material to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The following change is hereby made to the synopsis published on February 4, 2003 and modified on March 12 and 25, 2003:  The statement that reads “This solicitation is restricted to 8(a) firms with a bona fide place of business located in El Paso, TX” is changed to read “This solicitation is restricted for competition among all eligible 8(a) firms with a bona fide place of business located in the El Paso SBA District, El Paso, TX.”  The following definitions are provided for clarification purposes:  1. Bona Fide Place of Business:  For the purposes of 8(a) construction procurements, “bona fide place of business” means a location where a Participant regularly maintains an office that employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geog raphical boundary.  The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.  (13 CFR 124.3)  A Participant’s principal place of business is always a bona fide place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction requirements.  A Participant may have bona fide places of business in more than one location.  2. “Regularly maintains an office,” means a Participant conducts business activities as an on-going business concern from a fixed location on a daily basis.  The best evidence of the regular maintenance of an office is documentation that shows that third p arties transact business with a Participant at a location within a particular geographical area.  Such evidence includes advertisements, bills, correspondence, lease agreements, land records, and evidence that the Participant has complied with all local re quirements concerning registering, licensing, or filing with the State or County where the place of business is located.  For example, a lease agreement alone, without more, does not establish the regular maintenance of an office.  Further, it is our view that a Participant does not have a bona fide place of business in a particular location if it does not have the licenses, registrations, tax receipts, telephone bills, and filings commensurate with regularly maintaining an office at that location.  3.“Full-time individual” means an individual who conducts the business activities of the Participant during normal business hours.  The individual may not work for any person or entity other than for the Participant during normal business hours.  The term does not include independent contractors.  The best evidence of the employment of a full-time individual is employment agreements, payroll records, tax documentation, and employee benefit documentation.  4. SBA Determination of Bona Fide Place of Business in a Designated Geographical Area: (a) At any time, a servicing District Office may submit documentation on behalf of a Participant to another District Office in an effort to establish that the Participan t has a bona fide place of business within that District Office’s geographical area.  However, in order to apply for a specific competitive solicitation, such documentation must be submitted at least 15 working days before initial offers that include price  are due.  Within 10 working days of receipt of submission, the District Office will conduct a site visit, if practicable, and within five (5) working days of a site visit, it will make a determination whether the Participant has a bona fide place of busin ess in its geographical area. (b) If a Participant has established that it has a bona fide place of business, then the District Office will issue a letter to the participant informing the Participant of this determination.  The letter will also state that the Participant must immediately notify the District Office of any changes that could affect its bona fide place of business status.  The letter is valid as long as there are no material changes to the facts relied on by SBA in making its bona fide place o f business determination.  A district Office may re-evaluate a Participant’s bona fide place of business status at any time, and should cons ider any information relevant to that issue that it receives from another party. (c) If a District Office determines that a Participant has not established that it has a bona fide place of business, the District Office must submit that determination to the  Associate Administrator for 8(a) Business Development (“AA/8(a) BD”), or designee, for review before it is issued.  The AA/8(a) BD, or designee, will review that determination as quickly as possible. (d) A Participant has the burden of clearly establishin g that it has a bona fide place of business within a designated geographical area.  If a Participant submits conflicting, vague, or insufficient evidence or documentation, SBA may make a negative determination.  A Participant may reapply for bona fide plac e of business status at any time. 5. Eligibility Determination by SBA:  The District Office that services the apparent successful offeror or the nominated Participant makes Eligibility determinations.  13 CFR 134.507(b).  Eligibility includes bona fide place of business status for purposes  of competitive constructions requirements, and a District Office making an eligibility determination must rely on the bona fide place of business status determination made by the appropriate District Office.  For competitive construction requirements, SBA  will determine a Participant’s eligibility as of the date of a Participant’s initial offer, which includes price, and will make an eligibility determination within five (5) working days of a procuring activity’s request for an eligibility determination. 13 CFR 124.507(b).

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CORRECT AN ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL POSTING. 
    THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT WAS LABELED A " PRESOLICITATION NOTICE " BY MISTAKE. IT WAS ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, A " COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION ".  THE MARITIME ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 


United States Government ?V Maritime Administration
Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)
Vessel Defueling/Removal and Tank Cleaning Solutions

Description:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region, maintains ships stowage facilities for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age and contain various amounts of fuels, oil, lubricants, oily water and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. 

MARAD is seeking innovative technical/management approaches to the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and removal of all petroleum products, as well as tank cleaning operations of obsolete vessels. (A complete listing of the vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A. This list of ships is subject to change.)  In addition to conventional fuel removal and disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions are invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology, including, but not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techiques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products.  Note that some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.

Offerors may respond to one or both parts (i.e., defueling and/or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete vessels listed on Attachment A.  Upon award, offerors will be required to identify the types of petroleum products, total quantity of the product, chemical analysis of the product, and the proposed methods of removal for the petroleum products from the vessel and their subsequent transportation to a disposal or recycling facility.  MARAD anticipates that the costs of this project will be partially offset by the resale value of the fuel or petroleum product.

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established two periods, January 27-29, 2003 and May 19-21, 2003, for interested parties to visit the JRRF and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  MARAD requests those interested in visiting the JRRF contact the point of contact (POC) not later than Friday, January 10, 2003 to register for the January 27-29 fleet site visit and not later than Friday, May 2, 2003 to register for the May 19-21 fleet sit visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time for the visit. The JRRF POC is Mr. Mike Bagley (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, e-mail sharon.nesbit@marad.dot.gov.

Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to this PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative technical/management approaches for the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A 
?Y Methodology for identifying the types, total quantity, chemical analysis, as well as the  removal and disposal of the petroleum products
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with fuel removal and/or tank cleaning on obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of technical/management approach for the removal/disposal of petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Economic feasibility of the proposed approach(es) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed methodology for identification and chemical analysis of petroleum products
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed removal/disposal of petroleum products and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the removal/disposal of fuel/petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed technical/management approach(es)

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price. 

The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate the implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as to provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised and are considered confidential.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or all of the proposal(s) to implement the innovative solutions offered.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THOSE PARTIES INTERESTED IN SUBMITTING PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 

The following information is provided in response to questions MARAD has received regarding the JRRF vessel defueling and tank cleaning effort:


1. Question:  Are all the ships in the JRRF available to be cleaned/defueled?	      Five ships at the JRRF are presently scheduled to be dismantled without prior defueling or tank cleaning.  These ships are Mirfak, Catawba Victory, Mormac Dawn, Santa Isabel, and Santa Elena. While Contractors may still choose to submit proposals for the defueling/tank cleaning of these vessels, it is unlikely that the Government will award a contract for their defueling or cleaning outside of a total ship disposal solution.
2. Question:  Will the Government supply barges to move the used fuel?  Contractors must supply their own waste transport system.  Government transport or barges are not available. Contractors? vessels are limited to five foot (5?) draft for using the approach channel to the JRRF boat basin.
3.  Question:  What help or facilities can or will the Government provide, and what will the cost be for their use?  							      The Government can supply electricity (440 V, 200 amps, 3 phase), transportation to the vessels, crane service, and porta-potties.  MARAD can furnish an 18-ton land crane; 15 and 10 ton floating cranes; forklifts to 15,000 lbs.; and a pier side berth for up to a sixty-foot (+/-) craft. However, there will be a charge for the use of Government cranes, personnel, tugs, and the Government will perform its own price adjustment to the contractor?s proposal to include these charges.  For electricity, a disconnect box can be made available.  Any support provided by the fleet would be based on the standard fleet hourly rate for a normal workday (0700-1440).  Any time after normal working hours would be charged at an overtime rate of 1.5 times the standard rate. The type and extent of Government support required must be identified in the offeror?s proposal.
4. Question:  Can we work on the ships outside of normal working hours?  Contractors could be allowed to continue work on the ships outside of the JRRF normal working hours.  Each request would be considered individually. Launch services are available M-F 0715 to 1440.   Any launch services provided after these normal working hours are overtime.  Overtime rate is the standard fleet hourly rate times 1.5.  Launch services outside these days and times may be available, but this should be identified in the Offeror?s proposal.
5. Question:  Can we move a ship to clean and defuel it?  			 	The vessels can be moved to an outside berth for work to proceed, however any shifting of vessels will be performed by Government personnel and tugs. Offerors/contractors are not permitted to move the vessels.  If the contractor needed to shift a ship there would be a charge for these services which would be negotiated prior to contract award.  This charge would or could include a) removal of the vessel from the row, and b) if located in the center of a row; the cost of moving a new vessel into that spot for row continuity purposes. Except for ships located at the end of a row, each ship taken out of a row would require a ship from another position and possibly another row to be inserted in its place. This in effect necessitates a removal and placement of two ships.  The average time required for one evolution at JRRF is 745 man hours per event. This would be charged at the standard fleet hourly rate.
6. Question:  Does MARAD have a priority list for cleaning/defueling the ships?   In terms of priority, there is a list of the top 27 ships for disposal attached as an amendment to Announcement DTMA01E01001 posted on December 5, 2002. This list can be found on this web site under that announcement number.  However, MARAD is interested in reducing the overall quantity of oil and fuels in the entire fleet, and is also interested in innovations that would allow it to accomplish this goal. Therefore, proposals are not limited to these 27 high risk ships. 
7. Question:  Is the contractor responsible for re-ballasting the ship after fuel removal?  										      The contractor will be responsible for ballasting tanks and the final stability of the ship following the defueling and tank cleaning work.  Ballasting the tanks with river water is acceptable.
8. Question:  Who will provide line handlers during work? 			      The contractor shall provide the line handlers necessary to adjust mooring lines as pumping and ballasting changes the ship?s draft.  The JRRF would monitor this work.
9. Question:  What new hardware would have to be supplied as part of the work? 	Tank covers would have to be replaced using new gaskets.  Defective nuts, bolts and washers are also to be replaced.  The contractor should allow for a renewal of studs based on an inspection of the vessel prior to submitting their proposal.  Other existing hardware in serviceable condition can be reused.  In addition, any repairs necessary to close a tank will be required, so that offerors should survey conditions prior to submitting proposals.
10. Question:  To what standards would we have to clean the tanks? 		      The minimum standard for tank cleaning would be ?Safe for hot work?.  However, if offerors think they have another acceptable standard they should include and identify it in their proposal.
11.  Question:  Does MARAD have information on the quality and types of fuel in each tank?									      The quality and value of fuels in the ships are not known by the Government.  If the contractor wishes to take samples from a ship or ships before submitting a proposal, this may be done by arranging a site visit with the JRRF. The Government does have sounding figures estimating the amount of fuel in each tank, as well as capacity figures for each tank 
12. Question:  Will the oil/fuel piping have to be cleaned as part of the work?		 Pricing is desired for either or both of the following methods: a) sealing the oil piping using DC type, inflatable, or expandable plugs, and alternatively, b) flushing and cleaning the oil piping.
13.  Question:  Can information regarding soundings and tank capacity be made available?												This information is available from the JRRF upon request.  Contact Bob Rohr at (757) 887-3233 x17.
14. Question:  How much insurance will a contractor have to carry?  		     This depends on the method of cleaning and defueling that is proposed and the number of ships it will involve. 
15.  Question:  If a contractor submits a proposal for the February proposal(s) period, can they also submit a proposal(s) for the June submittal period? 			Yes.  Contractors are not restricted on the number of proposals they submit.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to BAA 02-06-IFKA "Audio Processing".  Technical POC:  Mr. John Parker, Program Manager, (315) 330-4236, email: parkerj@rl.af.mil  Contracting POC:  Contracting POC: Contracting Officer, email: IFKA@rl.af.mil  This amendment defines a more specific area than the broad announcement of BAA 02-06.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research site, is specifically soliciting white papers under this amended announcement for the development of a broadband noise reduction software capability that can separate noise from speech to improve both machine and human speech recognition.  In the past, AFRL/IFEC has developed a process called INTEL.  (See Technical Report "Real-Time Speech Enhancement Unit", Oct. 1999, DTIC Number ADB 249915.)  Although INTEL is being successfully used by DoD and law enforcement agencies, it has several technical shortfalls.  This request is to solicit new ideas and techniques to advance the state-of-the-art in broadband noise reduction pre-processing that is appropriate for both human and machine consumption.  A single channel capability, that is operator hands-free and can be operated in an on-line mode with a delay of not more than the average word length, is sought.  Deliverables include software source code and documentation to include test plan, monthly status reports, and final technical report.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offers are required to submit three (3) copies of a five (5) to nine (9) page white paper on their proposed research approach with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, small women-owned small or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institutions.  All responses to this BAA must be addressed to:  AFRL/IFEC, Attn:  John Parker, 32 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY  13441-4114.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:   Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B:  Task Objective, and Section C:  Technical Summary.  White papers must reference BAA 02-06-IFKA, Amendment 2, and shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this amendment.  Evaluation of proposals for this amendment only will be performed using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) The Overall Scientific and/or Technical Merits of the Proposal, (2) Innovative Approach and/or Techniques, (3) Contributions to the Tactical Speech Processing mission, (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously.  The technical criteria, 1-3 above, will also be used to determine whether the white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this amendment and of interest to the Government.  In addition, the Government may consider other factors such as:  (1) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (2) The qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel; and (3) The offeror's record of past and present performance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  Principle funding for the proposal selected from this announcement will begin in FY03 with awards not exceeding twelve (12) months in duration.  Total funding for this amendment is $240K.   Last date for submission of white papers is 25 April 03, for this amendment only.  All other elements of the initial announcement of BAA 02-06 have not changed and apply to this amendment.

<DESC>Economic progress in the Philippines has been impeded by population pressure.  The imbalance in population and economic growth is a significant factor in the continuing prevalence of absolute and relative poverty and the failure to attain the desired levels of health improvements.  As a consequence, infectious and communicable diseases, particularly tuberculosis, remain significant health problems, even as degenerative diseases are rising and increasing in significance.  Studies show that it will be very difficult for the Philippines to achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for poverty reduction even if the economy achieves its medium term economic growth targets unless a concerted population management program is put in place to check the prevailing high population growth rate.  Family planning and health programs in the Philippines are provided by local government units (LGUs) as mandated under the Philippine Local Government Code.  However, these LGUs still lack the necessary management capability, technical skills and resources to effectively serve the poor in their communities.  In support of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRPs) efforts, USAID/Philippines proposes to implement a Health Enhancing Local Partnerships (H.E.L.P) program under its Strategic Objective of Desired family size and improved health sustainably achieved.  The solicitation will seek proposals to provide technical assistance to strengthen the Local Government Units (LGUs) delivery and management of services for family planning, maternal and child health, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS preventive measures.  In particular, the program will support the intermediate results (IR) 1 and 4, of the above Strategic Objective:  LGU provision and management of FM/MCH/TB/HIV/AIDS services strengthened and Policy Environment and Financing for Provision of Services Improved, respectively, and their sub-intermediate results.  The program will be comprised of components similar to the following:  1.  strengthening the local level support for, and the management and provision family planning, TB, and other selected health services; 2.  improved national level policies to facilitate efficient delivery of quality family planning and health services.
Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP available April 1, 2003. The closing date of the submission of proposals is 3:00 pm , Manila Time, May 30, 2003. To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 Box 1, FPO AP 96515-1200 or Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City 1308 Philippines. You may also send your requests by email to  marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP. The solicitation once issued can also be downloaded from this website.

<DESC>The VA National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS), Ann Arbor, Michigan is soliciting information from potential sources for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data mining software utilizing state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques.  This COTS software will be used to extract information embedded in natural-language text from root cause analyses (RCA) reports stored in NCPS databases. The natural language text to be mined describes medical events containing synonym names, abbreviations, misspellings, and lexical that is extremely varied across regions and professions.   Data currently resides on a SQL Server 2000 database with event descriptions contained in multiple text and varchar columns within several tables.  Respondents should provide literature, at no expense to the government, for review to the issuing office, no later than the response due date.

<DESC>NA This project includes demolition of building 116 Crew Readiness, the construction of an addition with site improvements and selective renovation of building 107 Squadron Operations, extensive interior demolition and renovation of building 302A Base Communi cations Flight, limited interior demolition and renovation of building 300 Medical Squadron, and extensive interior demolition and renovation of building 103 and 316 for the Non-Destructive Inspection Shop.  This work shall be completed in phases and allow  time for the facility occupants to move into completed areas from areas that are to be renovated in subsequent phases. The following is a more specific description of the work for each facility.   Building 116 Crew Readiness is a single story facility of approximately 2400 SF.  This facility shall be demolished to make room for the addition to building 107 Squadron Operations.  The demolition of building 116 shall require caution to work around exis ting twelve inch fuel system lines that run under the building. The addition of building 107 Squadron Operations is approximately 14,400 square feet.  The new structure will have a steel frame, heavy gauge steel studs with an architectural masonry veneer, and a low slope EPDM roof.  Site improvements will include site utilities and asphalt parking and access roads.  Site work will also require caution working around the twelve-inch fuel lines.  Renovation of the existing facility will include corridor finishes, latrine/locker room areas, and fire detection system.  The existing building 107 will be occupied and operational during this project. Renovation of building 302A Base Communications Flight will include a near total demolition of finishes and systems in this two-story facility.  The project will include total replacement of the building HVAC system.  This area will be vacated for the dura tion of the work. Renovation of building 300 Medical Squadron will be selective demolition and reconstruction of interior partitions and finishes.  The primary building systems will not be significantly modified.  This work will be spread throughout areas that will remain o ccupied and operational during this work. Renovation of building 103 and 316 Non-Destruction Inspection (NDI) Shop includes the near total demolition of finishes, partitions, and systems on the lower floor of building 103 and the conversion of two areas in building 316 to NDI use.  The work areas in building 103 and 316 will be vacated during this project, but others areas of the facility will remain occupied.   Project phasing will require building 107 Squadron Operations to be completed and accepted for the current occupants of building 302A.  After acceptance of building 107, there will be a period of no work while the occupants vacate 302A.  When 302A is compl eted and accepted, there will be a period of no work while select occupants of building 300 relocate to this area.  Building 300 work will be the final phase of the project.  When this is completed the occupants of the areas surrounding the work area will move into the completed areas.  Work in building 103 and 316 can be accomplished independent of the other phases of work, however when these areas are started they will be completed in a timely manner.  The anticipated date for a Site Visit is 07 MAY 03.  The performance period for this project has been estimated at 630 Calendar Days.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Laser Alignment System.  The system will aid in the proper alignment of aircraft loading MHE with the aircraft cargo compartment.  The technology must be capable of integrating with large Mobility Air Forces aircraft such as the C-5 and C-17 cargo aircraft.  The AMB envisions a highly portable, rugged, compact, and eye safe laser transmitter and receiver. The envisioned system would be capable of being quickly attached and detached to cargo loaders ranging in capacity from 25K to 60K.  The system would utilize a wireless remote controller, be battery operated, and be compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs).  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST April 15, 2003.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH.  Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed MHE Laser Alignment System (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors?  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility.  e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING.  State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  f) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  g) AVAILABILITY.  Provide system availability information.  Is it available off-the-shelf right now?  If not, how soon can it be made available?  h) PREVIOUS WORK.  Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Edward M. Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctcnsc.org or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.

<DESC>Sources Sought - MOBIS contractors only.

This Sources Sought is requesting a response from Management, Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS) concerns capable of providing services in evaluating the security related services to the federal judiciary.   The responsibility for providing security related services to the federal judiciary is vested in two executive branch agencies: the United States Marshals Service (USMS), a bureau within the Department of Justice, and the Federal Protective Service (FPS), an organization within the Department of Homeland Security (DOH).
 
The contractor must provide all personnel, equipment and other items and services necessary management, supervision, manpower, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effectiveness in completing the final report. The contractor must be able to pass background investigation requirements.

The program study will include a review and assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the current standards, policies and procedures and make recommendations for improvements for courthouse exterior and interior physical security, after hours and 24 hour security, courtroom security, the USMS Court Security Officer (CSO) program, and the uses of FPS guards in court occupied facilities. 

The contractor will analyze the roles and relationships among FPS, USMS and the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts (AO) and their influences on the Judicial Facility Security Program (JFSP) and identify any management problems and/or issues due to divided responsibilities and overlapping roles.  The contractor will describe and analyze the potential impact of recommended changes to these relationships or responsibilities on planning, budgeting and managing the Judicial Facility Security Program.

The contractor will consider and analyze the effects of staffing, organization, and operational policies and practices of security requirements and standards in the judiciary and the impact of changing technologies for the future.

The contractor will assist the current security program functions and costs and will provide recommendations with supportive rationale and implementation strategies for consideration by the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, and any other appropriate entities as may be necessary. The contractor's recommendations must be designed to promote enhanced program accountability and credibility.

The Contractor will also conduct a feasibility study of a proposed uniformed "special or court security" officer division within the USMS, FPS or the AO.  The Contractor will consider whether full time equivalent federal employees should replace the current contracted Court Security Officers.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611 ($1. million).  Services are anticipated to commence on or about October 1, 2003.

Responses to this notice must include the following:  (1) capability statement to demonstrate the ability to perform these services; (2) management chart with the organization structure of the company; (3) a statement of financial resources which clearly and decisively indicate that the company can perform these services successfully;

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate and award a sole source modification under its existing cost-reimbursement contract with SRI International of Menlo Park, CA.  The contract’s current period of performance is July 31, 2000 through July 30, 2007. The contract is titled “Safety Evaluation for Anti-Infective Therapies.”  The contract number is N01-AI-05417.

The award of this modification will allow the NIAID to utilize SRI’s unique toxicology capabilities to determine the preclinical safety and pharmacokinetics of various potential therapies to be used in the treatment or prevention of infections from various Category A-C Bioterrorism agents.  The statement of work will be changed to increase the number of experimental therapies that the Contractor will be required to perform. In addition, a new SOW element will be added to allow the use of standard, pre-formulation and formulation principles and techniques to develop acceptable vehicles and/or formulations for systemic or parenteral delivery of experimental anti-infective agents to animal/humans.  This expansion of the scope of work will not result in an extension to the contract because the work will be completed within the remaining four (4) years of the contract period.

The original contract was awarded using full and open competition procedures.  NIAID intends to negotiate this one-time expansion under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(C)(ii).  NIAID believes that SRI International is the only source with the requisite unique extensive testing capabilities and resources to accomplish this additional effort.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties who believe that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim (please include contact person(s) and phone number(s)).  The Government will consider any such information received within 45 days of the publication date of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and award this modification to SRI International.   See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- Apparatus for Stopping Vehicles
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS A LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR STOPPING VEHICLES

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks licensee(s) to commercialize its apparatus and method for stopping vehicles. 

LLNL has developed and is patenting a truck stopping device (TSD) that remotely activates the truckâ€™s brake system to stop the vehicle. In one form, the TSD actuates the truckâ€™s air brake system through  an external pressure plate that can be impacted by pursuing police patrol cars. When the pressure plate is impacted by a patrol car in a specific manner, the truck or trailerâ€™s service and/or emergency brakes are applied.   Other  forms of the TSD are  actuated by  remote radio control devices. Portable versions of the TSD can be installed easily and temporarily on trucks entering and operating in critical areas so that  trucks can be kept under local radio  control at all times. The TSD is being tested by the California Highway Patrol on over-the-road fuel tanker trucks.  

Anti-vandalism features are built into the TSD design, as requested by  trucking industry representatives. An anti-disabling feature is incorporated into the system that activates the vehicleâ€™s emergency  brakes if an effort is made to disable or bypass the device.

Hijacked vehicles such as trucks are a major threat to public safety. Trucks are almost unstoppable by patrol cars, barriers or spikes in the road. The large mass of trucks and trailers prevents a patrol car from approaching the truck from the side or getting in front of it without great danger. Note that air brake systems are standard on all big trucks and trailers. The TSD provides an inexpensive, and yet effective means whereby police patrol cars can stop the truck/trailer by simply bumping the back or rear of the truck/trailer in one mode or by sending a radio signal in a second mode. The radio signal mode also allows security personnel  to stop a truck by remote control.


Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's truck stopping device technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.
 
Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000015-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in commercializing LLNL's apparatus and method for stopping vehicles technology.

<SUBJECT>--Pilot Program for an upgraded automated case tracking system.
<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command-Washington, on behalf of U.S. Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA), intends to negotiate a purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Office Automation Consultants, Inc. This objective of this requirement is to  obtain a pilot program for an upgraded and automated case tracking system and management application system to replace the currently utilized Oracle-based system. The software application package will track and manage over 700 appeals of decisions by cont racting officers. The test program will operate parallel to an existing Oracle system. The proposed system is available as a software package, that will meet the needs of the ASBCA without a need to rewrite a database design and that can be quickly adopted  rather than taking the years and major expense that the current system took to get developed. The proposed system will require minimal maintenance. This test support system is being ordered on a sole-source basis because the software being supported is pr oprietary to Office Automation Consultants, Inc. and is used at other courts and boards. The period of performance, including programming support and training, is not to exceed two months or 300-340 hours. Interested parties may submit Capability Statement s to Natesa Robinson via email at Natesa.Robinson@hqda.army.mil by 10 April 2003.

WORKING CONDITIONS FOR GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL - The contractor shall provide safe, efficient working conditions and accommodations to the Government personnel working on board.  The contractor, its agents, subcontractors, and employees, including the Captain and crew of the vessel shall not harass, assault, oppose, impede, intimidate, interfere with or make unwelcome advances toward any member of the Government field party.  Violation of the contractor's obligation under this clause may result in termination of the contract, at the discretion of the Government under the Termination for Cause Clause (reference 52.212-4(m)) and in consequent liability of the contractor to the Government for any costs incurred.  Violation of the contractor's obligations under this clause may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution of the person involved by either the Government or affected Government personnel, as provided by applicable law.  FIREARMS - While the vessel is at sea or while work under this contract is being performed in port, all firearms shall be locked in the Captain's quarters.  POSSESSION OF LIQUOR OR ILLEGAL DRUGS - During the charter period, the possession or use of intoxicating liquor and/or illegal drugs by any person is not permitted and may be grounds for termination of this contract by the Government.

The VOA's Chinese Branch is responsible for communicating news and information directly to the people of the world, in particular Chinese.  One of the methods of communication is via publications.  These publications contain scripts in Chinese or English, as well as information about web sites, and radio and television schedules where the reader can get more in-depth coverage of news stories.  To print and distribute by mail such publications requires funding not currently available.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines those duties the Contractor shall perform to enable the VOA to meet its goals of program distribution using publications while providing the Contractor with advertising or promotional opportunities in the Chinese market.  The requirement is for a contractor to provide for publication and distribution of a business magazine, Business Scene, targeting Chinese readers in the People's Republic of China.  Hard copies and electronic mail (email)-based versions of the magazine are distributed free of charge.  Services provided by the Contractor shall cover the cost of layout, solicitations for and placement of advertising, printing and distributing by mail of a monthly business magazine for readers in the People's Republic of China.  VOA seeks to benefit from obtaining professional publishing services at no cost.  In return, VOA believes the Contractor should benefit financially from retention of 100% of income derived from advertising sales.  The VOA Chinese Branch will provide, at no cost to the Contractor, all editorial content for the magazine and will develop, maintain and control the addresses to which the Business Scene should be sent.  The Government will provide and be responsible for all content of a monthly magazine with the exception of the advertisements that shall be oriented toward business, cultural or economic matters.  The Government reserves the right to reject advertising deemed unsuitable for the market and magazine content.  The editorial content will be business or economics related for readers in China.  The magazine will be printed in simplified Chinese characters and will be available for worldwide distribution.  Under no circumstance shall the Contractor use or cause the use of the publication or the publication's materials to be distributed within the United States.  Any violation shall be grounds for termination.  The Government will use its best endeavors to increase the number of names on the subscription list.  The list of these subscribers shall belong to the Government.  The Contractor shall solicit and place advertising in the magazine.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the layout and printing of the magazine as well as obtaining all necessary publishing permits and registrations.

Additional Terms: Under no circumstances shall the Contractor sell, lease, or otherwise provide the subscription list, or any portion thereof, to a third party.  The Contractor may not insert any editorial content in the magazine that has not been expressly approved in writing by the AR/CO.

<DESC>This requirement is a total small business set aside to provide employee assessment support services for the Department of Commerce (DoC), International Trade Administration (ITA), United State and Foreign Commercial Service (USFCS). 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. Proposals for this requirement are due by 2:30 pm on April 16, 2003. Each contractor shall submit an electronic version of their proposal to the Primary Point of Contact (loren.sunell@noaa.gov) and two (2) original copies to the External Customers Procurement Office (DoC/NOAA/NFA, SSMC IV, Suite 7503, Attn: Loren Sunell, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910). Questions will be accepted until COB Thursday, April 3, 2003. The contractor's proposal shall be submitted in accordance with the Proposal Instructions/Evaluation Criteria. 

The contractor will provide services in three main areas. First, develop the 2003 Assessment, to include updating, developing, and validating exercises, providing training materials and training to Assessors.  Second, administer the 2003 Commercial Service Assessment, to include candidate contact, scheduling and coordinating logistical arrangements.  Third, to provide onsite technical and logistical assistance for the duration of the Assessment, ensuring that the Assessment is held in an efficient, fair, secure, and legally defendable manner.

Subject to contractor validation and Commercial Service approval, there will be two panels operating concurrently at the Assessment site.  Each panel will consist of five Assessors and will assess six candidates per day.  This results in the following estimate of the number of candidates to be invited to Assessment Centers:

(1 Site) X (2 Panels) X (6 Candidates per Panel) = 12 Candidates per Day
(12 Candidates per Day) X (8 Days) = Approximately 96 Candidates

The 2001 Commercial Service Assessment format will be repeated.  The 2001 Assessment was developed by the Commercial Service with the support of a private contractor.  The winning contractor will have access to the complete report on the 2001 Assessment.  The contractor will be expected to provide services for the Assessment process only, not the pre-screening process.  The pre-screening process will consist of an evaluation of written applications to attend the Assessment.  Only once a candidate passes the pre-screening process will they be contacted by the Assessment contractor.

1.     Development of Assessment  

Exercise update and validation

The Assessment will consist of five exercises. All of the exercises are to be repeated in an updated format.  The five exercises are:

--Structured Interview:  This is done through two distinct interviews. The hypothetical interview presents candidates with job related situations similar to those they would likely encounter in the FCS and asks them to describe how they would resolve the problem presented. The Past Behavior Interview asks candidates to describe how they performed in specific situations in their experience that are similar to situations they could expect to encounter in the FCS.

--Group Exercise:  This exercise is a leaderless group discussion in which candidates work in a group of up to six candidates to solve a realistic work-related problem.  Each candidate prepares and gives a brief presentation on their assigned role to their peers, and then the entire group debates the various positions and comes to a decision.

--Advocacy Exercise:  The candidates play the role of Foreign Commercial Service Officers (FCSO) advocating on behalf of a U.S. company. They prepare and give a brief presentation, respond to questions on their presentation, and then compose a memo that summarizes the presentation and offers suggestions for next steps. 

--e-box Exercise: This exercise is a computer-based "speeded" Assessment.  Candidates decide which emails to delegate and to whom, and then they were required to put the remaining e-mails in order of priority. 

--Editing Exercise:  This exercise requires candidates to perform the common FCSO task of editing reports created by host country employees for whom English is not their native language.

The contractor is expected to develop new versions or new scenarios of each exercise, validate that the content of new exercises accurately test for the skills required (validation method is to be proposed by contractor and is subject to approval by the Commercial Service and the Contracting Officer), and pilot test each exercise.  As a part of this the contractor is expected to review and update each exercise's scoring systems as necessary.  The Commercial Service will provide subject matter experts to help update/revise exercises and pilot testers.  In addition, the contractor will be expected to either significantly revise the Editing exercise, or identify and recommend suitable alternatives to test for the same skill set, as the exercise was viewed as unsatisfactory in 2001.  

Assessor Training

The contractor will develop a 3-day training course, including training materials for the Assessors on how to correctly conduct the exercises and score the candidates' performance.  The training course will include background on the purpose of the Assessment Center, its structure, the skills tested in each exercises, how to properly give instructions, role playing exercises, scoring, and other suitable elements suggested by the contractor and approved by the Commercial Service.  The contractor will conduct the training.   The Commercial Service will provide reproduction services, binders, etc. for these training materials.

Candidate Forms, Assessment Center Manual, and Assessment Supervision

The contractor will develop information and forms for the candidates to read and sign at the beginning and end of the Assessment.  These forms are designed to ensure that each candidate has equal information on the nature of and instructions on the Assessment, to validate that each candidate has taken each test and that all candidates are treated equally, as well as to provide candidate feedback on the Assessment.  Candidate information and forms will be subject to approval by the Commercial Service.

The contractor will develop a manual for use by the Assessment Center Director on all standard operating procedures for the Assessment, and include all schedules, all tests, instructions, scoring sheets, monitoring instructions/information, and any other material deemed appropriate by the contractor or Commercial Service. 

The contractor, in conjunction with the Commercial Service, will develop a final rating system to rank all candidates, and provide the final ranking of all candidates based on that rating.

2.	Assessment Coordination and Logistics

The contractor will manage all contact and scheduling with Assessment candidates, and will develop a database of candidate contact and background information.  The contractor will personally contact all invited candidates to verify information and provide information about the Assessment.  

The contractor will provide a welcome letter and information sheets to each candidate to ensure all candidates receive the same information about the Assessment.  The contractor will organize a schedule for each Assessment day, and schedule each candidate for a specific day.  

Many of our candidates are expected to be internal - e.g., already Department of Commerce employees and therefore "known entities" to the Assessors.  Consequently the contractor will develop a 'familiarity' survey and ratings which will provide information on whether and how well the Assessors know the candidates.  Based on these ratings the contractor will schedule each daily exercise to assure appropriate assessor/candidate pairings to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest between the Assessors and the candidates, or bias (or perceived bias) either towards or against a particular candidate.

All scheduling will be subject to approval by the Career Development and Assignments Staff (CDAS) and from the Contracting Officer.

The contractor may be required to assist the Commercial Service to identify appropriate venues for the Assessment.

3.	Onsite Management, Technical, and Logistical support

The contractor will be onsite at the Assessment Center (July 27-August 8, 2003) to ensure that the Assessment is managed fairly, effectively, and properly, and that all candidates are treated equally and in an unbiased and legally defensible manner.  

In additional, the contractor will provide technical assistance or answer any questions from the candidates, Assessors, or Commercial Service employees.  

The contractor also will be expected to be on site during the Assessment to ensure that the scheduling is done smoothly and fairly, and to ensure the rooms are properly equipped.  The Commercial Service will provide all equipment and materials (including computers and printers) required for the Assessment.

The contractor will ensure the security of the Assessment, including maintaining the integrity of all Assessment testing and scoring materials and records to ensure that no materials or records are lost, copied, or stolen or otherwise made available to unauthorized users.  The Commercial Service will provide Assessment monitors as necessary to ensure the integrity of candidate behavior in candidate break rooms and other common areas.  The contractor will provide training to the monitors on to ensure that all candidates are monitored equally.
