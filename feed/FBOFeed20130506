<DESC>NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Presolicitation Synopsis as required by FAR 5.2.<br />The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force anticipates releasing a solicitation in the near future as a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330, Engineering Services, Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons which has a corresponding size standard of $35.5M. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hub zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). This notification is a synopsis of a solicitation for potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. The A-10 SPO requires systems engineering support to fulfill its role as prime integrator.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE<br />This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, , and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with use of the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0, as a systems engineering tool as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>
<p>TASK REQUIREMENTS<br />See attached PWS <br />Please note that the Government will not exclude any specific contractor from competition on this requirement, unless a contractor is automatically excluded as a result of a regulatory exclusion of certain type of contractors (e.g. small business set-aside).</p>
<p>NOTES<br />This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this synopsis <br />Contract performance may also involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center, and have an approved DD Form 2345, will be provided copies of any related solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION<br />Primary points of contact are:<br />&bull; Michelle Carpenter, Contract Negotiator at michelle.carpenter@hill.af.mil<br />&bull; Nathan Lee, Contracting Officer at nathan.lee@hill.af.mil<br />&bull; Keith Lewis, Program Office at keith.lewis@hill.af.mil</p>

The Army Standard for Housing for this request is two (2) Soldiers per room upon availability (Double Occupancy). The facility shall be able to support at least 12 double rooms per night for three nights on a monthly basis for 12 consecutive months (starting September 2013 through August 2014).

The solicitation will be posted on or about 10 May 2013 via Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.  The due date will be stated in the solicitation.  Please note the response date listed with this pre-solicitation notice is not the actual due date.

<a href="mailto:rosalia.toberman-1@nasa.gov">Rosalia  Toberman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to add five (5) each additional detail airport models to the NASA owned Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified Phase II/Level C B747-200 flight training simulator located at the United Airline (UAL) training facility in Denver, Colorado.  The airports are Palmdale, Edwards AFB, Victorville, Moffit Field, and Vandenburg, CA.  These additional airport models are critical to supporting the safe flight operations of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) program. NASA/DFRC intends to acquire the services directly from the United Services Flight Training Center as they in-conjunction with Rockwell-Collins Flight Simulations just completed the upgrade and refurbishment of the flight simulator to include the installation of the twenty-five (25) standard airport model package included in the NASA/DFRC simulator maintenance and upgrade contract NND11AQ62P.  Authority for the requirement is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2)  Only one responsible source. Justification is based upon the following facts: 1.	The Phase II/Level C B747-200 flight training simulator is located at the United Airline (UAL) training facility in Denver, Colorado.   United Services (being the owner, operator, and maintenance provider of the facility) has the proven track record and experience in customizing airport models to meet user requirements; and in addition United Services has immediate access for installation, verification, and validation of the customized software package. 2.	Use of another vendor other than United Services would require duplication of effort for both development and installation causing a significant increase in cost and delay in completion Based upon the above, utilization of any other service provider in-lieu of United Services would result in: a) substaintial duplication of effort and cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from United Services. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 20, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	   .

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICATION NOTICE ONLY - The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP), is planning to issue a solicitation to provide health data management services to assist with the Ambulatory Care and Private Physician Programs. Hansen's disease in the United States occurs primarily in California, Louisiana, New York, Puerto Rico, and Texas, among Asian and Hispanic populations in these areas. The solicitation will be issued as total small business set-aside with a period of performance of twelve (12) months with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about May 30, 2013. The required services will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611, and the size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Hansen's disease is a chronic infectious disease of low communicability, caused by the acid-fast Mycobacteria, M. leprae. It affects the skin and peripheral nerves in the cooler parts of the body. It is effectively treated by multidrug therapy consisting of Dapsone, Rifampin, and Clofazimine. Untreated, it can lead to loss of sensation in the affected areas, leading to trauma, infection, and eventually to deformity and disability. It is the goal of the National Hansen's Disease Program to prevent deformity and disability by raising awareness about Hansen's disease, increasing the detection of its' early signs, and initiating treatment early in the disease process.</p>
<p>The legislative authority for the National Hansen's Disease Programs is Public Law 99-117, Section 2. (a.), Section 320, and is guided by DHHS regulations. The Ambulatory Care Program (ACP) was initiated in 1981 as a consequence of the closing of the U.S.P.H.S. hospitals. Historically, persons with HD were provided care by those facilities in the U.S. In order to continue the mandate of the legislative authority, a Contract Care Program was developed to provide these services in communities where the majority of people with HD live. Currently, there are thirteen (13) Outpatient HD Clinics located in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Puerto Rico, Washington, and Texas. The state of California has three Outpatient HD clinics (Martinez, Los Angeles, &amp; San Diego), and the state of Texas also has three Outpatient HD Clinic sites (Dallas, Houston, &amp; Harlingen), with the main administrative site in Austin, TX.<br /><br />This requirement is to maintain and update the HD health information system (Microsoft Access) used for program management in the ACP with data input from the Outpatient HD clinics throughout the U.S. &amp; Puerto Rico through CDs sent to the ACP. Database is comprised of 3500 patients, along with a separate database of patients &amp; physicians in the Private Physician Program. The work involves continuous verification of PHI due to the various ethnicities, languages, &amp; cultural factors of the patient population. The services will be performed at the National Hansen's Disease Program, 1770 Physician Park Drive, Elliott Building, Baton Rouge, LA 70816.</p>
<p>All future information regarding this acquisition, including the solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). Copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks input from Industry on technologies and potential solutions for two (2) sets of Common Data Link (CDL) radio capabilities to support Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS).
<p>Recent enhancements to the Common Data Link could lead to significant growth in the portfolio of CDL platforms through integration of the mandated, standardized and interoperable CDL communications capability into smaller UAS. Greater flexibility in data rates, frequency bands, and improved spectral efficiency offer the opportunity to expand the use of CDL into Group 1-3 UAS platforms, for example, the Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) currently under development for the Navy and Marine Corps. CDL employment was previously precluded for use in many of these UAS groups due to the limited Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) budgets of the platforms.</p>

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory.

(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States.

At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.

<DESC>This effort will look at the re-processing of platform-processed wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) data from both the Gorgon Stare (GS-1/GS-2) and Blue Devil platforms; the net effect is to provide warfighters with a capability for increased motion imagery quality and improved motion imagery exploitation. The re-processed WAMI data must overcome observed image anomalies that plague processed data at the platform level such as jitter, spatial distortion, and atmospheric distortion. The expected output of re-processing WAMI data is a reduced-volume data set achieved through compression approaches where the redundant data is discarded and nominal background imagery is consolidated. Application of enhanced automatic tool overlays such as target tracking also must be available as plug-ins and interfaces to analytical software.

<DESC>Market Research/Request for Information: The F-16 FMS Contracting Office, Hill AFB, UT is requesting information from interested sources about a potential requirement for an evolutionary software update to an F-16 Fleet's Operational Flight Program (OFP) from initial production version M4.3 to OFP M6.2 for the Polish Air Force's (PlAF) Advanced F-16 Fighter Block 52+ C &amp; D model aircraft. This request is to obtain information to determine if responsible sources exist that would allow this requirement to be competed or set-aside for small business. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $35.5M. The Government intends to use the information submitted in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy for this requirement. The Government is interested in receiving responses from all interested sources including 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, hubzone, and women-owned small business concerns. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. <br />Modular Mission Computer (MMC)-based architecture of the F-16 allows for evolution and continuously improving OFP product. Significant improvements including new capabilities have been developed since the Polish Air Force took initial delivery of their F-16s. The Republic of Poland Armament Inspectorate F-16 Program Office has requested an M6 OFP Upgrade to ensure Poland maintains commonality with USAF to maximize Poland's operational and logistical benefits. The Government has limited rights to the OFP data associated with the Poland OFP modernization program and is unable to provide data associated with this effort to interested offerors. The contractor will be required to perform the required engineering, develop kits for kit proofing in-country, deliver kit re-procurement drawings with unlimited government rights, provide familiarization of the modification implementation, provide source data to update the Country Specific Technical Orders, and TCTO data. <br />Interested sources should respond to this RFI and describe your technical approach for accomplishing this requirement. Your response should include a description of your past five (5) years experience with the F-16 and identify any major cost, schedule, and risk drivers associated with your technical approach. Any cost information provided in response to this RFI will not be binding. Your response should also identify your small business status for the above identified NAICS code. Also, please identify if you anticipate using teaming arrangements along with a breakout of the work to be accomplished by the prime and each team member. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information requested except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs. It is anticipated all information received in response to this RFI will be unclassified. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as company private or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the Government. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the Government's review of their responses. Interested parties must respond in writing. Your response to this request must be submitted no later than 5 Jun 2013, addressed to Linda J. Andrews via e-mail (Linda.andrews@hill.af.mil).

<DESC>THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
IS SEEKING CLINICAL SPACE 
IN THE STATE COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA AREA

The Department of Veterans Affairs desires to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield no less than 13,156 and no more than 14,478 of contiguous net usable square feet within the boundaries established below in the State College, Pennsylvania area.  This space is for use as a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) by the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, Altoona, Pennsylvania.  All space must be located on the first floor of a building and must meet all Government requirements for fire safety and handicapped accessibility.  On-site parking for a minimum of 40 vehicles and an additional 20% accessible parking is required.  The Government will consider both existing and build to suit properties.  A lease for a base period of ten (10) years with five (5) additional one (1) year option periods for a total of 15 years will be considered.

Space is required to be located within the State College area, specifically space will only be acceptable if it is within or fronting the boundaries outlined below.

Beginning in the southwest corner of State College PA-26 S/W College avenue to State Route 3024 and West White Hall Road to University Drive Extension to Claremont Avenue to Carolean Drive to Shiloh Road to Premiere Drive to Shiloh Road to Rock Road to Fox Hill Road to Toftress Avenue to Valley Vista Drive, Park Forest Village, to PA-26 S/W College Avenue;

and includes all properties that border either side of the roadways that make up the boundaries.

The delineated area boundaries were selected because they are within College Township, which is the municipality in Centre County with the largest veteran population and it is centrally located within the county to afford the greatest accessibility to veterans who are projected to utilize the new CBOC.  The average travel time for veterans to reach the CBOC within the delineated area will be 14 minutes or 11.4 miles.  Additionally, the boundaries encompass the commercial district of College township which increases veteran accessibility because public transportation services are available within the delineated area.

A market survey of properties offered for lease will be conducted by VA.  Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) should contact James R. MacIntyre II by telephone, mail, or email no later than 3:00 p.m. March 29, 2013 (EST), at the following address:

James R. MacIntyre II (90)

2907 Pleasant Valley Blvd.
Altoona, PA  16602

Email:  james.macintyre@va.gov
	
The Government is limited by law (40 USC 278a, as Amended 10-01-1981) to pay no more than the appraised fair rental value for space.

Please note:  This advertisement is not a solicitation for offers, nor is it a request for proposals.  A solicitation for offers (SFO) may be issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs at a later date.

IN THE JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA AREA

The Department of Veterans Affairs desires to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield no less than 13,156 and no more than 14,478 of contiguous net usable square feet within the boundaries established below in the Johnstown, Pennsylvania area.  This space is for use as a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) by the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, Altoona, Pennsylvania.  All space must be located on the first floor of a building and must meet all Government requirements for fire safety and handicapped accessibility.  On-site parking for a minimum of 100 vehicles is required.  The Government will consider both existing and build to suit properties.  A lease for a base period of ten (10) years with five (5) additional one (1) year option periods for a total of 15 years will be considered.

Space is required to be located within the Johnstown area, specifically space will only be acceptable if it is within or fronting the boundaries outlined below.

Beginning at the intersection of Bedford Street and Walters Avenue then east to Solomon Run Road to Fulmer Road.  East on Frankstown Road to Engbert Road to Solomon Run Road to Mt. Airy Drive.  South on Mt. Airy Drive to Oakridge Drive to Jari Drive to Oakridge Drive to Industrial Park Road to Allenbill Drive to Industrial Park Road to Oakridge Drive to Jari Drive.  North on Jari Drive to Oakridge Drive to Industrial Park Road to PA-756/Elton Road to Schoolhouse Road.  South on Schoolhouse Road to Theatre Drive.  Southwest on Theatre Drive to PA-56W/Scalp Avenue to Eisenhower Blvd to North on Kring Street to East on Belmont Street to Bentwood Avenue to Ohio Street.  Northwest on Ohio Street to McCort Place to Bentwood Avenue.  Northeast on Bentwood Avenue to Bedford Street and Walters Avenue Intersection.

 All properties within, bordering, and abutting the delineated area are eligible for consideration provided the properties meet VA's other requirements as detailed within the Solicitation for Offer (SFO).
The delineated area was selected based on the commercial areas of Johnstown, Pennsylvania that are not located with the City's 100 year flood plain and the immediately surrounding areas.  This area is serviced by the Cambria County Transit Authority which makes it accessible to the veteran population.  Additionally, this area of Cambria and surrounding counties is centrally located for the veteran population to be served by the Johnstown CBOC.

A market survey of properties offered for lease will be conducted by VA.  Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) should contact James R. MacIntyre II by telephone, mail, or email no later than 3:00 p.m. March 29, 2013 (EST), at the following address:

<DESC><em>[Please note that this posting is for market research only, and is not a request for proposal or solicitation]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code 541380 (Testing Laboratories).</em><br /><strong><br />Project Title: Study on Influenza Virus (H5N1/H1N1)Infected Ferrets</strong><br /><br />This study deals with measuring the cross-neutralizing ability of neutralized antibody in plasma. Based on published reports, plasma from patients can neutralize influenza. The FDA plans to verify this with ferrets infected with influenza virus, H5N1 and H1N1.  To understand whether / how convalescent plasma treatment reduces mortality and improve the recovery of patients infected with H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, the FDA plans to study viremia and disease pathogenesis of H5N1 virus and pandemic H1N1 virus infection in the susceptible ferret animal model.<br /><br />To examine blood safety and virus neutralization by convalescent plasma, ferrets will be used to inoculate intranasal with one ml of H5N1 virus with 500 &micro;l to each nare with one times of EID50. Plasma, which will be collected from the ferrets on day0, day30, day60, day120, or day180 post-infection, will be given to ferrets, separately, on day 2 post-infection. Clinical signs of infection, weight, and temperatures are to be recorded daily. Virus load in lung, brain, ileum, nasal turbinate, nasal wash and blood, and cytokines in blood will be tested.<br />
<p><strong>To be considered eligible for this study the contractor shall have, at minimum:</strong><br />&bull;	Access to a Biosaftey Level 3 (BSL-3) containment laboratory.<br />&bull;	Prior documented experience in H5N1 influenza research in ferrets.</p>
<p>Interested <strong><em>SMALL BUSINESS ONLY</em></strong> (if available, please include small business representations and certifications and DUNS number) should submit their capability statements no more than 10 pages in length to:</p>
<p>Christopher R. McGucken<br />Contract Specialist, Food and Drug Administration<br />Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services<br />5630 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20851</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Christopher.Mcgucken@fda.hhs.gov</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are to be submitted no later than <strong>12pm (noon) EST on May 20th, 2013</strong>. Generic capability statements will be considered non-responsive. Capability statements must be tailored to this request and identify the source's capabilities to complete this requirement- including information on availability of a BSL-3 laboratory, and prior experience performing H5N1 research on ferrets.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Manual Wedge Wire Bonder to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The system will be sited and used in the CNST NanoFab as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies.<br />&nbsp;
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract for an Automated Resist Coater/Developer System. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CNST NanoFab currently owns and operates a single manual wedge wire bonder which is dedicated to using 25 micrometer-diameter gold wire. Switching from gold to aluminum on the existing bonder is a time consuming task and necessitates the re-optimization of process parameters after each wire change. To increase capacity and improve process repeatability, NIST requires a second wire bonder that can be dedicated to bond with 25 micrometer-diameter aluminum wire. NIST has the need for a new wire bonder that meets the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>a. The system shall be: <br />i. Manually operated.<br />ii. A table-top model.<br />iii. Equipped with a single lever Z-manipulator.<br />iv.

Capable of storing a minimum of 10 user programs.</p>
<p>2. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:</p>
<p>a. The bonder head shall be able to switch between a 45 degree and 90 degree wire feed.<br />b. The wedge shall be equipped with a radiant tool heater.<br />c. The bonder shall accept wire with diameters from 18 micrometers through 50 micrometers. <br />d. The wire spools shall be 12.5 mm (0.5 inch) in diameter.<br />e. The bonder shall be capable of accepting both aluminum (Al-1 percent Si) and gold wire.<br />f. The system shall be equipped with a 63 kHz, half wave transducer.</p>
<p>3. WORKHOLDER:</p>
<p>a. The workholder shall be equipped with the following:<br />i. An adjustable height platform.<br />ii. A heater with temperature controller capable of heating and controlling the workholder to a minimum of 125 degrees C.</p>
<p>4. WIRE BOND CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>a. The system shall have the following capabilities:<br />i. Bond force shall be adjustable from 10 g to 250 g.<br />ii. Z-travel shall have a minimum range of 12.5 mm (0.5 inch).</p>
<p>5. MICROSCOPE:</p>
<p>a. The microscope shall be equipped with a stereo-zoom with at least 50x magnification.<br />b. The microscope shall be equipped with a ring illuminator.</p>
<p>6. TRAINING: The vendor shall provide on-site operation and maintenance training following installation.</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>

<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to paula.wilkison@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS THE SAME REQUIREMENT AS DESCRIBED IN SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AMD-13-SS40; ONLY THE NAICS CODE IS DIFFERENT.
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Manual Wedge Wire Bonder to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The system will be sited and used in the CNST NanoFab as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Contract for an Automated Resist Coater/Developer System. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CNST NanoFab currently owns and operates a single manual wedge wire bonder which is dedicated to using 25 micrometer-diameter gold wire. Switching from gold to aluminum on the existing bonder is a time consuming task and necessitates the re-optimization of process parameters after each wire change. To increase capacity and improve process repeatability, NIST requires a second wire bonder that can be dedicated to bond with 25 micrometer-diameter aluminum wire. NIST has the need for a new wire bonder that meets the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>a. The system shall be: <br />i. Manually operated.<br />ii. A table-top model.<br />iii. Equipped with a single lever Z-manipulator.<br />iv. Equipped with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection.<br />v. Configured for wedge bonding on first and second bond.<br />vi. Capable of stitch bonding after second bond.<br />vii. Capable of storing a minimum of 10 user programs.</p>
<p>2. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:</p>
<p>a. The bonder head shall be able to switch between a 45 degree and 90 degree wire feed.<br />b. The wedge shall be equipped with a radiant tool heater.<br />c. The bonder shall accept wire with diameters from 18 micrometers through 50 micrometers. <br />d. The wire spools shall be 12.5 mm (0.5 inch) in diameter.<br />e. The bonder shall be capable of accepting both aluminum (Al-1 percent Si) and gold wire.<br />f. The system shall be equipped with a 63 kHz, half wave transducer.</p>
<p>3. WORKHOLDER:</p>
<p>a. The workholder shall be equipped with the following:<br />i. An adjustable height platform.<br />ii. A heater with temperature controller capable of heating and controlling the workholder to a minimum of 125 degrees C.</p>
<p>4. WIRE BOND CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>a. The system shall have the following capabilities:<br />i. Bond force shall be adjustable from 10 g to 250 g.<br />ii. Z-travel shall have a minimum range of 12.5 mm (0.5 inch).</p>
<p>5. MICROSCOPE:</p>
<p>a. The microscope shall be equipped with a stereo-zoom with at least 50x magnification.<br />b. The microscope shall be equipped with a ring illuminator.</p>
<p>6. TRAINING: The vendor shall provide on-site operation and maintenance training following installation.</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333242, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture Manual Wedge Wire Bonders are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to paula.wilkison@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><strong>3. PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> Since opening in April, 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has hosted over two million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibits and public programs are housed in a 258,000 square foot building, which in many ways evokes the Museum's subject matter. The Museum's staff offices are located primarily adjacent to the Museum in the Ross Administrative Center, a 45,000 square foot building which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in leased office space elsewhere in the District of Columbia. The Museum also has a remote storage and conservation facility outside of the District of Columbia. It has become apparent that modifications need to be made to accommodate the Museum's expanding collections and developing programs. There are also a number of maintenance issues caused by the Museum's great success which need to be addressed. <br /><br />The Museum's Division of Operations is looking to issue IDIQ contracts with firms who will be able to make these adjustments in a manner which is architecturally compatible with either the Museum's design aesthetic, or with the historic fabric of the Ross Administrative Center. These contracts will be overseen by the Museum Architect. As the projects are expected to range considerably in size, scope, and public visibility, it is anticipated that the Museum will establish contracts with multiple firms, at least one of which has an emphasis on historic preservation and materials conservation.<br /> <br />The following services are expected to be contracted for as part of these contracts: complete design services including the preparation of construction contract drawings, specifications and cost estimates, both preliminary and final; site investigations; planning studies; preparation of presentation drawings, models, and sample boards; programming; space layouts; tenant space plans; interior design, including furniture and finish selection; shop drawing reviews; value engineering; construction services; post-construction services; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services which may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. Some projects will be initiated as part of this contract, and flow from programming and schematic design through construction documentation. Other projects will be based upon schematic designs provided by the Museum Architect. <br /><br />The firm or firms selected shall have either in-house expertise or consultants with expertise in the following areas: architectural conservation, museum planning, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, fire protection engineering, and cost estimating. Some projects may require specialized expertise in graphic design, architectural lighting, historic preservation, and architectural materials conservation. Additional required expertise may be needed for a specific project, as required by the Government. <br /><br />The firm or firms selected, and their consultants, shall be licensed to practice their respective disciplines in the District of Columbia. As such, they shall be familiar with all applicable codes, as well as with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. They shall also be familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, particularly as it relates to the selection of furniture and interior design elements. They shall also be familiar with the procedures and requirements of the National Capitol Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, as well with as the Section 106 Historic Review Process. In addition to traditional architectural presentation techniques, architectural drawings done as part of this contract shall be submitted in electronic format which is compatible with AutoCAD Release 13 on compact disk, and done according to the guidelines established by the American Institute of Architects. Some of the task orders issued under this contract may require background checks of the firm's personnel, including criminal background checks. In addition, for some task orders, the firm may need to submit a SF-85 and sign a non-disclosure agreement. </span></p>

<p>*The formal closing date for this RFI and for the submission of responses is Monday May 20, 2013 at 2PM EST*</p>
<p>In an effort to improve the health and wellness of TRICARE beneficiaries through preventing the initiation of smoking and increasing quit rates among existing TRICARE beneficiaries that smoke, the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is authorized to provide smoking cessation assistance service in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2009, Section 713. These services are available to all TRICARE eligible beneficiaries in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia (CONUS), with the exception of Medicare-eligible TRICARE Program participants program; and eligible beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). For purposes of this contract CONUS refers to the 50 United States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Quitlines, which offer smoking cessation counseling are recommended by the U.S. Public Health Services Clinical Guideline for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (2008 update) as an evidenced-based intervention that has been shown to increase the success rates of smokers who try to quit.</p>
<p>Currently, triage-only smoking help-lines are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. These toll-free help and referral lines offer triage and referral but do not provide smoking cessation counseling.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the quitline relevant for this query would instead be capable of providing smoking cessation counseling from certified smoking cessation counselors.</p>

2.	BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Product Development (PD) is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States.

The Veteran Relationship Management (VRM) Program was established in response to several key challenges that Veterans, service members, and their dependents experience when seeking information and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Modernization of our telephony capabilities and our agents' ability to resolve Veteran's issues is a primary focal point of the VRM program.

<DESC>PLEASE BE ADVISED THIS IS PRE-NOTICE OF INTENT ONLY. NO SF330S WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME. THE ACTUAL NOTICE DATE TBD. THE INTENT OF THIS PRE-NOTICE OF INTENT IS TO ALLOW FIRMS TO IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES AND TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS TO REDUCE OVERALL ACQUISITION LEAD TIME. ALL INQUIRIES MUST BE SUBMITTED BY 4 MAR 13 AT 3:00PM MST INORDER TO ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO RESPOND BY THE PRE-NOTICE CLOSE-OUT DATE OF 8 MAR 13 AT 3:00PM MST.
<p>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN RESPONDING TO THE ADVISORY SUPPORT A&amp;E PLEASE VIEW FA8201-13-R-0008 PRE-NOTICE OF INTENT POSTED ON FBO.</p>
<p>Description<br />1. Contract Information: These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in the FAR Subpart 36.6 and DFARS Subpart 236.6. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. IMPORTANT NOTE: If selected for negotiations on either the Services or Advisory contracts; the prime firm and all sub-consultants cannot be involved in the award not selected for. (I.E. if selected for services the sub-consultants and the prime itself cannot be involved in any aspect of the Advisory contracts, it creates a conflict of interest for the Government and the firms). Please annotate the interest in your SF330 if submitting for both acquisitions in order of interest. EXAMPLE: 1 Services, 2 Advisory - meaning if selected for both your first priority for award is Services. If selected for your priority you will not be considered for the alternate. Conversely: 1 Advisory, 2 Services - meaning if selected for both your priority is Advisory and you will be excluded from the Services award.</p>
<p>2. The support services will consist of, but not limited to: providing engineering, technical, and administrative services support to the Hill IST Environmental Management and Planning Programs. Related services will provide support to program oversight, third party review, innovative technology implementation, data analysis/management, GIS technology applications, adaptation to changing environmental regulations, emerging industrial requirements, and quality assurance protocols. In addition, Support Contractors may be required to assist with programs to investigate the existence, extent and character of environmental contamination in all media types, assist with the development of CERLCA documents and remedial actions, provide third party reviews on remedial design and process optimization, cost accounting and tracking budgeting requirements, and to assist with environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs; to include permit applications, and oversight of studies involving all media. Services will be for support of Hill AFB, Little Mountain Test Annex, Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), and the Western Region as defined in the Statement of Work and attachments.</p>
<p>3. Two indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with one base year and four option years. The amount of each contract shall not exceed $15,000,000.00. Work on each individual task order will be negotiated as firm-fixed-price task orders. The technical team and Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, and equitable distribution of work among the contractors.</p>
<p>4. The contracts are anticipated to be awarded in October 2013. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 with a size standard of $35.5M under the "Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" exception. These contracts are being solicited as a total small business set-aside. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work). To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM)). Register via the SAM internet site found at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>5. Contract Specific Information: Title I Design Support Services: Title I tasks include support and review of design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, as well as operation, monitoring, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems. Title II Services: Title II tasks include assistance with oversight of construction quality assurance and technical reviews for construction and environmental projects. These services may include, but are not limited to, design review, report review and innovative technology reviews. Other A-E Services: The contractor will assist the Air Force in the performance of a wide variety of environmental management functions, including assistance with programs to investigate the existence, extent and character of environmental contamination in all media types, provide third party reviews on remedial design and process optimization, engineering trade studies, innovative technology implementation, cost accounting and tracking budgetary requirements, strategic planning, GIS/GeoBase technology applications, compliance monitoring, public outreach, data analysis/management, assistance with developing statements of work and cost estimates for A&amp;E Services projects, administrative support, permit applications, and reporting.</p>
<p>6. Selection Criteria: The selection criteria for these IDIQ's are listed below in descending order of importance. All interested firms are to complete attachment C in order to be considered for award. NOTE: Criteria 2 and 3 are of equal importance and criteria 4 and 5 are of equal importance. Criteria 1-6 are primary and are the only criteria used.</p>
<p>(1) Professional Qualifications of key personnel: The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to be effectively innovative and contribute to the successful completion of project task orders. Responses will be evaluated to determine personnel:</p>
<p>(a) experience on federal programs related to work requirements, (b) certification/licensing, (c) years with company, and (d) education. See Attachment C for list of Key Personnel.</p>
<p>(2) Recent specialized experience: SF 330, Part I, Block F, list only current projects or projects completed in the past three years. These projects should show scope and nature similar to the A&amp;E Services SOW. A discussion of the challenges faced, actions taken, resolution and results and cost or time savings to the government, as well as key personnel in Section G that worked on the projects and their role. Specific project experience will be evaluated for ability to support the following requirements:</p>
<p>(a) environmental quality: Three (3) projects showing the ability to support a compliance program, i.e. Air, Water, Hazardous Waste, or Hazardous Material <br />(b) conservation and planning: a project showing the ability to support Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP) <br />(c) GIS applications: a project showing your ability to develop and implement GeoBase applications <br />(d) environmental restoration: a project showing the ability to support the CERCLA/RCRA process.</p>
<p>(3) Capacity of the team to accomplish the work: Within the SF 330, Part I, Block H, each firm shall demonstrate how they will manage, coordinate and administer the work within the prime and among any teaming partners. SF 330, Part IIs shall only be provided for key personnel from the specific prime office expected to lead this effort and key personnel from the teaming partners proposed to perform the work.</p>
<p>(a) capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members;<br />(b) ability to manage, coordinate, and administer work within prime and among teaming members;</p>
<p>(4) Past Performance: History on both DoD and other contracts in terms of quality, timeliness, and cost control (based on past performance at Hill, for other federal agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and timely performance, ACASS database is a source of information as are reference letters and commendations submitted in the SF 330 package). SF 330 Block H. Cite examples of performance and customer satisfaction such as recognition for technical achievements, cost savings, or commendations received by your team for projects similar to the scope of work. Past performance questionnaires will be reviewed and are supplied as attachment B. The government suggests receiving, filing, and submitting them as a whole to ensure the questionnaires are received by the cutoff date. Previous acquisitions have shown not all personnel requested to complete a questionnaire have done so. Responses will be evaluated to determine:</p>
<p>(a) ability to maintain cost, schedule, and quality; <br />(b) customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>(5) Geographic Location: Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project, availability of A&amp;E staff to meet frequently with Air Force personnel, regulatory agencies, and others in the Hill IST and the ability to mobilize staff to project sites on relatively short notice. NOTE: There is no geographical region a contractor must be in to receive full points. The contractor must display the ability to respond effectively and reasonably without unreasonable inconveniences being associated. (I.E. describe how it is more effective, or comparably effective, than a local firm and how the performance would compare being geographically separated from the requirements - techniques involved, technology used, sub-contractor presence, etc.)</p>
<p>(6) Volume of Work: SF 330 Block H should clearly identify, in table format similar to SF 330, Part II, Block 11, the volume of DOD work for the prime contractor. Amounts should represent the total amount of any DOD contract vehicle in which obligation of funds has occurred in the previous 12 months from the date of this announcement.</p>
<p>7. Submission Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit two copies of the SF 330 Part I, and two copies of the SF 330 part II for the prime and all consultants, to the above address not later than XX April 2013 at 4:00pm MST. See attachment labeled "Attachment A" for exact page limitations and formatting for the SF 330, "Attachment B" past performance questionnaire and "Attachment C" Contractor Information for additional submission requirement clarifications. Facsimile transmissions will not be accepted. Solicitation packages are not provided and no additional project information will be given to firms during the announcement period. This is not a request for proposal and at no point is pricing to be submitted or considered.</p>

The services will be performed for the Golconda Job Corps Center, located in Golconda, IL. <br /><br />The Golconda Job Corps Center currently has a BPA for non-emergency and emergency medical care with Hardin County General Hospital (HCGH). When HCGH performs these services, radiological imagining services may be requested by the physician on call.

These services may include: General Diagnostic Radiology (x-rays), Computed Tomography (CT) Scans, Ultrasounds, Mobile Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI)'s, and Mobile Bone Density Imagining Studies. <br /><br />HCGH has the capability to conduct radiological imagining services, but does not have a radiologist on its medical staff to read and interpret the imagines. HCGH uses contracted radiologist support. So the actual radiological readings are performed by a contracted radiologist. These services are performed at Hardin County General Hospital by Saline Valley Diagnostic, but Saline Valley Diagnostic provides separate billing for these services, and is not included in the billing for Hardin County General Hospital. <br /><br />As a result, Saline Valley Diagnostic is the <strong><em>only</em></strong> service provider authorized and contracted with HCGH to interpret radiology imagines and tests which are performed at the HCGH. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

<RESPDATE>051313
<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014966546, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) to modify Contract HHSN276200800005C on a sole source basis. It is the NLM's intent to extend the period of performance and increase the contract dollar value for the current Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc. contract which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2013. The intent is to extend the present period of performance up to six (6) months (July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013). The initial award was competed on FBO under NAICS Code 511120 Periodical Publishers. This is a commercial firm-fixed price contract to provide website and publishing services to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to publish the monthly scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP).
<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate with the incumbent Contractor, Brogan and Partners Advertising Consultancy Inc., on a sole-source basis. This extension will permit the continuity of services on the current contract and allow an adequate amount of time to re-compete the requirement. Brogan &amp; Partners has the extensive experience necessary to continue meeting the goals and objectives of this contract during the period of re-competition. A new vendor will not be able to provide the required level of services to NIEHS without significant preparatory activities. The incumbent Contractor possesses the immediate institutional knowledge required to continue day-to-day operations of EHP until the contract is successfully re-competed. A different vendor will not be able to provide the required level of performance in the short time required for this extension (0-6 months) without a significant increase in costs and an extended learning curve which could result in a delay in production or disruption of services. By utilizing the incumbent Contractor during this contract extension period, EHP would be able to continue day-to-day operation without unacceptable delay in fulfilling the monthly mission of producing a quality journal of scientific research and news for the world. Also no additional costs would be incurred by NIEHS due to project delays. Therefore, Brogan and Partners is the only Contractor capable of providing comprehensive and uninterrupted services for the NIEHS' EHP in such a brief period of time.</p>
<p><br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is a RFP available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the aforementioned modification. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 3:00 PM EST on Monday, May 13, 2013. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NIHLM2013732SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, May 8, 2013.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis for the proposed modification to Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094 - Continued Development and Modification of openLCA Open Source Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Software and Database Framework
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), and the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) located in Cincinnati, OH awarded Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094 under FAR 12 & 13 procedures to Green Delta TC.  
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A), with Green Delta TC to modify Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094, increasing the scope of work to provide support for the continued development of OpenLCA and modifications necessary for the system to meet the demands of the next stage of research.  Green Delta TC is the original developer of OpenLCA and is the owner of OpenLCA SourceForge open source software.
The overall objective of this modification is to implement a generic user interface and functionality to allow for the development of application-specific, non-expert user interfaces for interacting with life cycle assessment models and address high priority items related to the basic functionality of OpenLCA and the attractiveness of OpenLCA to a broader pool of open source software developers. 
Specific work that will be added to this order will include the following: -	Development of a Quality Assurance Project Plan -	Implement changes to the OpenLCA source code, documentation, and web presence in order to build the community of open source software developers, -	Develop a plug-in to OpenLCA which allows a model developer to create and customize an attractive, easy-to-use, intuit non-expert user interface (NEXUS-I) for their model. -	Provide additional functionality for the NEXUS-I tool to allow non-expert users to interact with modeling choices by varying direct inputs, parameters, and process locations to see the effect on results in real time. -	Apply the non-expert user interface development functionality to develop tools to meet the needs of ORD stakeholder; test and refine the non-expert user interface development functionality.
In addition, the EPA seeks to negotiate pricing for the option of addressing unresolved issues raised by the EPA Quality Assurance Software Audit. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Samantha Fuchs via e-mail to Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)</p>
<p>FOR THE KEY VERIFICATION ASSETS FUND PROGRAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FULL TEXT ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p><br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Broad Agency Announcement - annual update. Any updates or possible cancellation will be issued as an amendment to the BAA. This annual review and subsequent amendments to the BAA shall meet the requirement of FAR 35.016 to update the BAA notice no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p>SECURITY: All submissions shall remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level.<br />I. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Requiring Agency: United States Department of State</p>
<p>2. Broad Agency Announcement Title: Key Verification Assets Fund Program</p>
<p>3. Broad Agency Announcement Number: BAA-2013-DOS-AVC-VTRDN</p>
<p><br />4. Response Date: This announcement will remain open until 2400 hours Eastern Time on the closing date, 1 year from public posting. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated, please see the submission deadlines in Section IV Paragraph 4.</p>
<p>5. Program Summary: <br />Background:<br />The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance (AVC) through the Key Verification Assets Fund (V Fund) Program seeks ambitious, innovative research proposals to address requirements outlined in the UNCLASSIFIED Verification Technology Research and Development Needs (VTRDN) Document. AVC invites researchers and project managers to submit white papers for sustaining, researching, developing, or acquiring technologies or programs relating to the verification of chemical, biological, nuclear and missiles arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament agreements or commitments.</p>
<p>The V Fund program continues the Department of State's objective to find innovative approaches to current and future arms control, and nonproliferation policy implementation challenges through exchanges between the science and technology, policy and intelligence communities. The program supports and preserves critical verification assets and promotes the development of new technologies, improves and expands analytical tools, models, data and metrics applicable in the science and policy decision-making process.</p>
<p>The intent of the V Fund is to be "seed money" for the Department to encourage other agencies either to develop new technologies or to adapt existing projects to the needs of arms control verification, and therefore its resources are, by design, modest relative to the scope of its mission.</p>
<p>The program requests annual project white papers ranging from the basic science level to assistance for the operation of a fully developed capability. The V Fund program welcomes white papers from individuals or multi-investigator research projects, experimental and on-going research by government organizations, national laboratories, academia, and industry. White papers must consider issues affecting arms control and nonproliferation.<br />6. FY14 Requirements:</p>
<p>The V Fund will select a number of proposals for FY2013 and FY2014 funding. The number will depend on resources available and on the quantity/quality of proposals responsive to this BAA. Offerors are invited to propose research and technologies that address topics within the UNCLASSIFIED Verification Technology Research and Development Needs (VTRDN) Document, located with this announcement.</p>
<p><br />7. Communications:</p>
<p>Prospective offerors may contact the technical points of contact (listed below) to verify interest in the effort to be proposed PRIOR to committing any resources to the preparation of any white papers in response to the BAA. Discussions shall not include content or rating information of other offeror's proposals or White Papers. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Questions outside the scope of the technical focal point, such as contract terms and conditions, or projected award schedule, should be referred to the contracting officer (CO). Only COs are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>8. Points of Contact:</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this announcement must be provided to the points of contact below. All questions shall be submitted in writing by e-mail.</p>
<p>Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to:<br />Contracting Officer: Benjamin Sherrill<br />1701 N. Ft. Meyer Drive<br />Rosslyn, VA 22209<br />703-875-4983<br />E-mail: sherrillbd2@state.gov</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to:<br />V-Fund Program Manager: Astrid Lewis<br />Email: VFund@state.gov<br />202-647-5075</p>
<p>Requirements/Needs: Daniel Wurmser<br />Email: wurmserda@state.gov <br />202-647-0854<br /><br />9. Contract Instruments/Awards: <br />Multiple awards are anticipated. Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria contained in Section IV, paragraph 5. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. The State Department anticipates that Awards because of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts, purchase orders or Interagency Acquisition Agreement through existing contract vehicles from the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, or any agency, entity, or other component of the intelligence community. <br />II. AWARD INFORMATION<br />The amount and period of performance of each selected proposal may vary depending on the research area and the technical approach pursued by the selected offeror. The period of performance is typically twelve (12) months from the effective date of award by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The Department of State plans to make multiple awards under this BAA, which represents the best value to the Government in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in Section III, Evaluation Criteria of BAA-2013-DOS-AVC-VTRDN. DOS is seeking institutions and participants for this program that are capable of supporting the goals and desired outcomes as described in this BAA. Offerors have the opportunity to be creative in the selection of the technical and management processes and approaches to address the areas of interest described in the UNCLASSIFIED Verification Technology Research and Development Needs Document.<br />DOS anticipates approximately $1.8 million will be available to make V Fund approved awards. This information is only an estimate and does not obligate the Government in any way. Estimated funding amounts may increase or decrease at anytime based on current and future appropriations.</p>
<p>There is no set limit on the award levels for each proposal: however, approved cost proposals are generally anticipated to fall between $500 and $150,000.</p>
<p>III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This BAA is open to all interested parties, including Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDC), government, national, academic (college and university) laboratories and non-government organizations.</p>
<p>IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Application and Submission Process: White papers that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. An individual at a qualified institution wishing to apply for an award must submit a white paper and quad chart as described in Section II. The submission shall follow the procedures and formats described under the proposal preparation guidance found in Section IV Paragraph 2 "Form of Proposal" and Section IV Paragraph 3 "Form and Content of White Papers."</p>
<p>Offerors must identify on each page information considered proprietary by marking their submissions with the restrictive language contained in FAR 52.215-1(e), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br />In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address. Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other information submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>No further notice will be provided to offerors submitting offers responsive to this BAA. All submissions shall remain at the unclassified level.</p>
<p>2. Form of Proposals<br />White Paper/Quad Chart:<br />This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Do not submit a formal proposal at this time. The purpose of the white paper and quad chart (referred to as white paper throughout) is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate is needed in the white paper, although not at the level of detail as required in response to a request for proposal (RFP) issued by the Contracting Officer (CO) at a later stage of the process. The ROM cost estimate should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. White papers must sufficiently detail the concept's technical merit and its potential contributions to the AVC's mission.</p>
<p>White papers will be accepted at any time. Technical reviews/selection points may be conducted based on the needs of AVC at anytime. However, white papers are estimated to be evaluated bi-annually on February 15 and June 15. Selectee(s) will be requested to provide full proposals upon completion of the technical review.<br />Other than white papers, no proposals should be submitted. A letter requesting a proposal (RFP) will be issued by the Contracting Officer (CO) as determined by a peer or scientific review of a white paper. Due dates and times will be specified in each letter requesting a proposal issued by the CO.</p>
<p>White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. If requested to submit a formal proposal the offeror will be requested to do so in accordance with the RFP. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended.</p>
<p>3. Form and Content of White Papers<br />White papers submitted under this BAA are expected to be unclassified. Titles given to the White Papers/Full Proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not be merely a copy of the title of this solicitation.

<DESC>The next quarterly meeting of the Stennis Business Consortium (SBC) will be held on Tuesday, May 21, 2013 in the auditorium of building 1200 at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, beginning at 1:00 pm. The mission of the SBC is to provide a mechanism for federal agencies, local institutions, and businesses to exchange information on small business goals, needed and emerging technologies, upcoming procurement requirements and opportunities, and issues dealing with existing procurement regulations. This is accomplished through quarterly meetings where specific information is exchanged based on funding cycles, forecasts of small business needs, as well as inquiries from small businesses. Speakers from the following agencies and large contractors are planned: Mississippi Developmental Authority (MDA)'s Minority & Small Business Development Division (MSBDD); General Services Administration; NASA-Stennis; Navy Supply Command/Naval Oceanographic Office; Space and Warfare Systems Command - New Orleans and QinetiQ North America.	Also, Table-top exhibits in Millennium Hall (Building 1200) will feature the products and services from small minority and woman-owned businesses beginning immediately following the SBC meeting.  This is an opportunity for government and prime contractor representatives to meet with local minority business owners and obtain details about their products and services, as well as small businesses to network with each other to discover common interests and strategic goals.   There is no fee to attend either event.  Register at:  www.mset.org If you do not hold a Stennis Space Center security badge, please register for this event no later than close of business on Friday, May 17, 2013 in order to ensure that a visitor's pass is authorized for you at the south gate security office in time for your arrival. Contact Laurie Jugan (228-688-1192) or ssc-mset@mail.nasa.gov for more information.

The challenge is to understand the feasibility and potential to glean currently unanticipated and or hidden information from structured and unstructured data sets.<br />Data sets may include, but are not limited to:<br />- Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA)<br />- Flight Simulator Operations Quality Assurance (SOQA)<br />- Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) <br />- Aircrew Safety Action Program (ASAP)<br />- Safety investigation findings<br />- Training data, records, and reports<br />- Standardization (audit) reports<br />- Maintenance records and reports<br />- Aircrew scheduling data<br />Detailed work plans under CRADAs will be determined by discussions between the candidate Collaborator and USTRANSCOM. The collaborative work may involve, but is not limited to, the following areas: <br />- Exploring best practices and various approaches to data fusion and advanced analytics<br />- Assistance in development of an AMC employment concept (CONEMP) for use of aviation enterprise data <br />- Assistance in development of a concept of operations (CONOPS) for aviation enterprise data analyses<br />- Examination of possibilities, challenges, etc., regarding integration of aviation enterprise data/information with other with existing information systems/services/programs<br />- Evaluation of economic factors involved in acquiring or accessing the aforementioned capabilities (e.g., acquisition strategies, service costs, procurement and lifecycle costs, predicted return on investment, payback period, etc.)<br />- Limited scope/scale demonstration of analytical tools applied to selected data sets<br />CRADA collaborators should have significant expertise and experience in collection and analysis of the above-listed data sets as well as data analytics.<br />This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM, AMC, or any other Government agency in this area.<br />United States-owned small and large businesses, universities, and other non-federal parties may respond to this announcement. Respondents (potential Collaborators) may team with other qualified non-federal parties. <br />Multiple federal agencies may participate in this collaborative project on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM and AMC, including federal laboratories and other agencies as the U.S. Government deems appropriate.<br />Information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities are proposed to remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level. If classified information exchange is indicated, Collaborator personnel must provide, at no cost to the Government, clearance documentation prior to classified data/information exchange.<br />Results and products of this collaborative effort may include reports, presentations, simulations, demonstrations, and analyses of feasibility, technical maturity, costs, risks, etc., as well as (but not limited to) recommendations on changes to doctrine, training, concepts of employment, and concepts of operation.<br />CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property, and other resources with or without reimbursement (excluding funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property, funds, and other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."<br />CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a 3-year period, although duration can be tailored to suit both parties' needs, by mutual agreement, before or after work begins.<br />USTRANSCOM and other Government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow), based on Collaborator demonstrated applicable experience, technical qualifications, resources offered, etc. Government resources available for collaboration will also be considered. <br />USTRANSCOM will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers and will invite selectees to engage in discussions pursuant to reaching agreement on CRADA goals, schedules and resource contributions.<br />Initial white paper selection and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.<br />After initial Government white paper selection, discussions will ensue separately with each potential Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement between USTRANSCOM and the Collaborator(s) on objectives, duration, intellectual property and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA(s). The Government may choose to visit applicable facilities to observe Collaborator capabilities prior to final selection. The Government may choose to hold an Industry Day or similar activity, at or near Scott AFB, Illinois either before or after initial white paper selection.<br />No Government funding is available to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits, or any other Collaborator costs of preparation or participation in a CRADA.<br />The USTRANSCOM CRADA template is available for download at http://www.ustranscom.mil/about/org/tccs/Model_USTRANSCOM_CRADA.pdf for potential Collaborator familiarization. Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will cooperatively draft and finalize specific CRADA scope, objectives, commitments, and language through discussions/and mutual agreement after Collaborator selection.<br />Interested parties must submit white papers not later than 7 June 2013 2359 hrs, via e-mail only, to USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil in following format.

<DESC><strong>&nbsp;Notes:<br />&bull; This is the second solicitation to FY13 BAA announcement. If an Offeror has submitted to previous AFCEC BAA solicitations and would like to be reconsidered under this announcement, the Offeror will need to re-submit a new or revised pre-proposal/white paper as stated below.</strong>
<p><strong>&bull; Please review all past AFCECBAA-11-001 Complete Questions and Answers (attached) before submitting a question to the Contracting Officer (CO). </strong></p>
<p><br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), Environmental Quality Technical Support Branch (CZTQ) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to more efficient and effective solutions for environmental compliance concerns across the Air Force and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Environmental Compliance and Pollution Prevention Programs. This solicitation is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e., a service). The Environmental Quality Program areas of need for this announcement are:</p>
<p>a. Hazardous Materials: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies or methodologies to remove or treat Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) from Aqueous Fire Fighting Foam (AFFF). The Air Force has excess AFFF stockpiles that contains between 3 to 6% PFOA/PFOS. Proposals need to develop a cost effective mechanism to remove or treat PFOA/PFOS from the AFFF to reduce disposal costs for the Air Force while transitioning to new formations of AFFF that do not contain PFOA or PFOS. Current destruction of AFFF is through incineration which is expensive to the Air Force.</p>
<p>b. Industrial Wastewater Treatment: Proposals should identify new or innovative industrial wastewater treatment technologies for recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewater treatment plants. Example installations are Robbins AFB and Hill AFB.</p>
<p>c. Stormwater Modeling Techniques: Proposals should identify installation-wide watershed modeling approaches that enable base facility engineers to maintain compliance with Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) section 438. Each base has industrial stormwater permit that requires best management practices to eliminate illicit discharges to waters of the United States. Example of best management practices include but not limited to use energy efficient low maintenance technologies to reuse stormwater from roofs, parking lots, runways and other impervious surfaces. Additionally, mission requirements identify and manage the reduction of flooding conditions. Air Force does not want to build retention and detention systems for projects. Priority will be given to proposals that do not use continuous simulation techniques.</p>
<p>Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US - companies, academic institutions, non-profit institutions, and/or government agencies. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Acquisition Overview: The AFCEC BAA is a two-step process that includes two phases of proposal submittals:</p>
<p>Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br />http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</p>
<p>Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEC BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCECBAA-13-002 is Fiscal Year 13, 4th Quarter.</p>
<p>How to Apply: All Phase I white papers/pre-proposals must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEC's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa). Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 01JUNE 2013. Phase I submittals received after 01 June 2013will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Evaluation/Notification: Phase I white papers/pre-proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the evaluation criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs (as indicated in the Phase I evaluation criteria) are notified electronically via email to submit a proposal to Phase II (request for proposal); those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are sent to key personnel contact information listed in Phase I white paper/pre-proposal along with a Request for Proposal (RFP) Package, Phase II instructions, how and when Phase II proposals are to be submitted to the Air Force. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required.</p>

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  <br>  <br> Send protests (other than protests to the contracting officer) to:  <br>  <br>   Address:  <br>  <br> Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 4400 Martin Road <br> Rm: A6SE040.001 <br> Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 <br>   Fax: (256) 450-8840  <br>   The AMC-level protest procedures are found at:  <br> Web Address: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp <br>  <br> If Internet access is not available contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures. <br>  <br> 52.232-4004 ARMY ELECTRONIC INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS NOV/2011 <br>  <br> Contractor shall submit payment request using the following method(s) as mutually agreed to by the Contractor, the <br>  <br> Contracting Officer, the contract administration office, and the payment office. <br>  <br> [XX] Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) (see instructions below) <br>  <br> [ ] Web Invoicing System (WInS) (https://ecweb.dfas.mil) <br>  <br> [ ] American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X.12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats <br>  <br> (http://www.X12.org and http://www.dfas.mil/ecedi) <br>  <br> [ ] Other (please specify)_______________________ <br>  <br> DFAS POC and Phone: Questions concerning payment should be directed to the Defense Finance Accounting Services (DFAS) Indianapolis through the DFAS Centralized Customer Service number 888-332-7366  (select option 2) or faxed to (877) 701-5069.

A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another <br> day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees <br> involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE <br> FOLLOWING: <br>  <br> 1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category. <br>  <br>  <br> ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** <br>  <br> If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract <br> (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state <br> or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by <br> laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by <br> an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the <br> wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance <br> with the following standards as compliance: <br>  <br> The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an <br> adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the <br> actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance <br> is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors <br> subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide <br> collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the <br> furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all <br> employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 <br> cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are <br> made of  quote mark wash and wear quote mark  materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other <br> personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry <br> cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the <br> cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, <br> by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement <br> that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>  <br>  <br> ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION ** <br>  <br> Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the <br> Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, <br> prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only <br> upon such contingencies as  quote mark approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage <br> determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, <br> adjusting the contract price, etc. quote mark  (The relevant CBA section) in the collective <br> bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that <br> Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting  quote mark arm's length negotiation quote mark  under <br> section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage <br> determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits <br> paid under the predecessor contract. <br>  <br> The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the <br>  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations quote mark , Fifth Edition, April 2006, <br> unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the <br> Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at <br> http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) <br> Web site at http://wdol.gov/. <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard <br> Form 1444 (SF 1444)} <br>  <br> Conformance Process: <br>  <br> The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which <br> is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the <br> work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage <br> determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable <br> relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted <br> classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such <br> conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished <br> the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be <br> initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such <br> unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or <br> fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. <br> {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a <br> contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to <br> which a class(es) is to be conformed. <br>  <br> The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>  <br> 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed <br> occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). <br>  <br> 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in <br> order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for <br> each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed <br> wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of <br> the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no <br> authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be <br> submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted <br> class(es) of employees performs any contract work. <br>  <br> 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a <br> report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent <br> information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the <br> Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of <br> Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>  <br> 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or <br> disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or <br> notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to <br> process the request. <br>  <br> 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the <br> contractor. <br>  <br> 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. <br>  <br> Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond <br> paper. <br>  <br> When preparing a conformance request, the  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of <br> Occupations quote mark  (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure <br> that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in <br> the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required <br> tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage <br> determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or <br> subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> REQUIRED RESPONSE DATE: Quotes MUST be received by 1000EST Tuesday, May 21st 2013. Electronic submissions via email or facsimile (fax) will be accepted. If you An official authorized to bind your company shall sign the quote.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>SP3300-13-Q-0080 is being issued as a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6-Acquisitions of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 Effective 01 Apr 2013, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20130419 effective 19 Apr 2013, and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2013-44. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>Business size for this acquisition is unrestricted. The Product Service Code (PSC) is 6140 and associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335911.</p>
<p>This is a brand name acquisition for East Penn Manufacturing/Deka-brand batteries for the FKI Maestro material handling system. Only East Penn Manufacturing/Deka-brand batteries will meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification:<br />DLA Distribution Susquehanna Pennsylvania has a requirement to purchase Deka-brand batteries that are original equipment for the FKI Maestro material handling system.</p>
<p>DLA Distribution Susquehanna Pennsylvania must use Deka-brand batteries because it is the only product on the market that is designed for Intelligrated Systems, LLC which owns FKI. Intelligrated states that East Penn Manufacturing/Deka is the only battery manufacturer with the drawings to make these batteries. No other brand will meet this requirement, due to form, fit, and function, based on past user experience.</p>
<p>An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.</p>
<p>As a result of the above, and in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) the Contracting Officer has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to conduct this acquisition by limiting sources based on the use of a brand name specification.</p>
<p>The requirement consists of the following:</p>
<p>Item 0001- 12 EACH-Battery, Standard Flooded, 36 volt, 152 amp, RIGHT, FKI Maestro P/N 18-P38-09, NSN 614000L100080. FOB DESTINATION to DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA 17070.</p>
<p>Item 0002- 12 EACH-Battery, Standard Flooded, 36 volt, 152 amp, LEFT, FKI Maestro P/N 18-P38-09, NSN 614000L100079. FOB DESTINATION to DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA 17070.</p>
<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>Invoicing and Payment for supplies under any subsequent order resulting from this solicitation shall be done using Wide Area Workflow.</p>
<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.</p>
<p>(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items within 30 days after date of contract.</p>
<p>If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:</p>
<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items within 45 days after date of contract.</p>
<p>Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p>OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items within _____ days after date of contract.</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (d) products samples, (e) multiple offers, and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. Addenda to FAR 52.212-4; the following clauses apply: FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination.</p>

<p>FAR 52.223-18 Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging while Driving</p>
<p>FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-5. Facsimile Proposals</p>
<p>FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract. The Government contemplates award of one firm-fixed price contract for all items.</p>
<p>DFARS 252.203-7002 Requirement to Inform Employees of Whistleblower Rights</p>
<p>DFARS 252.204-7003 Control of Government Personnel Work Product</p>
<p>DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items. The following additional clauses/provisions apply:</p>
<p>DFARS 252.203-7000 Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials</p>

<p>DFARS 252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments</p>
<p>DLAD 52.211-9033 Packaging and Marking Requirements</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS. Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the Government Accountability Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR).</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.247-9012 REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT OF WOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL (WPM) REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT OF WOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL (WPM) (FEB 2007)</p>

<p>(c) All wood packaging material (WPM) used to make shipments under Department of Defense (DOD) contracts and/or acquired by DOD must meet requirements of international standards for phytosanitary measures (ISPM) 15, "Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Materials in International Trade." DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo.</p>
<p>(1) All WPM shall comply with the official quality control program for heat treatment (HT) or kiln dried heat treatment (KD HT) in accordance with American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated (ALSC) wood packaging material program and WPM enforcement regulations (see http://www.alsc.org/).</p>

All dunnage used in configuring and/or securing the load shall also comply with ISPM 15 and be marked with an ALSC approved dunnage stamp.</p>
<p>(d) Failure to comply with the requirements of this restriction may result in refusal, destruction, or treatment of materials at the point of entry. The Agency reserves the right to recoup from the Contractor any remediation costs incurred by the Government."</p>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with size standard of $25.5M.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Enterprise Systems Division (ESD) of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) project to provide the ability to host applications, servers, and storage space and provide access to these resources. NIST is seeking to obtain Government Community Cloud services that will provide an on-demand, self-service IaaS offering to NIST OISM's customers. The goal is to establish consolidated and integrated public service delivery capability for Development/Testing that will streamline the implementation and support of NIST websites, virtual machines, and applications to the Public Cloud.<br />The project objectives include:<br />&bull; Identify the challenges presented in implementing/offering private, public, and hybrid cloud-based IaaS capabilities in NIST's environment <br />&bull; Identify chargeback, network, and security strategies for an on-demand self-service infrastructure<br />&bull; Identify cloud platform virtualization layer requirements <br />&bull; Identify cloud management layer requirements<br />&bull; Identify the challenges in migrating virtual servers among on-premise and off-premise IaaS providers<br />&bull; Understand interoperability between NIST Private cloud and provider's community cloud <br />&bull; Increase OISM expertise in Cloud Computing deployment models <br />&bull; Develop an architectural design for an OISM IaaS cloud</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification</p>
<p>AWS is a Cloud Service Provider offering cloud storage and virtual machine services in a Government Community Cloud. AWS is the largest commercial entity with a dedicated focus on Cloud Storage and Virtual Machine and is positioned as the dominant market leader.</p>
<p>NIST is in need of a Government Cloud environment that contains all required security, service delivery and hosting capabilities necessary to effectively support the development, and testing needs of NIST. With AWS, NIST can requisition compute, storage, and other services on demand, gaining access to a suite of secure, scalable, and flexible IT infrastructure services as needed. AWS provides cloud services a pay-as-you-go model, delivering access to technology resources that are managed by experts. Access to AWS services are provided over the internet, with no upfront costs, and NIST pays only for the computing resources that are consumed.</p>
<p>AWS GovCloud is designed to allow US government agencies to move more sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements. In addition, NIST is piloting IaaS using the Eucalyptus platform which is very compatible with AWS services allowing NIST to test interoperability scenarios in a hybrid environment.</p>
<p>The AWS GovCloud is uniquely positioned with a dedicated focus on Cloud Storage, Virtual Machines, and secure environment to provide scalable cost-efficient solutions for NIST to complete our IaaS pilot project to discover how cloud services can help our scientists reduce costs, drive efficiencies, and increase innovation. The AWS solution is only available from limited authorized government partners as designated by AWS.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was founded in 1901 as the nation's first federal physical science research laboratory.
<p>The Advanced Measurement Laboratories (AML) complex which is approximately 536,507 square feet one of the most technologically advanced complexes in the world, and provides combined features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and power quality for scientific research at the NIST. The AML complex consists of five buildings (buildings 215 through 219), each with one inhabitable scientific level. Two metrology buildings (buildings 218 and 219) are below grade, two physical sciences buildings (buildings 216 and 217) and a Cleanroom building (building 215, NanoFab) are located above grade.</p>
<p>The NanoFab provides researchers rapid access to a comprehensive suite of tools and processes for nanofabrication. This world-class shared resource provides researchers with a unique combination of a simple application process, extensive tool and process development, hands-on training, and access to NIST-wide expertise in nanoscience and nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The NanoFab (Building 215) features a large, dedicated cleanroom, with all the tools operated within an 8,000 square foot (750 m2) class 100 space, or in adjacent laboratories that have superior air quality along with vibration, temperature, and humidity control. Over 65 major tools are available for electron beam lithography, photolithography, nano-imprint lithography, laser writing and mask generation, field emission scanning electron microscopy, metal deposition, plasma etching, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and silicon micro/nano-machining. This equipment is selected to provide users with a high degree of flexibility with tomorrow's technologies. All of the tools within the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab are designed to accommodate a wide variety of materials and substrate sizes from small pieces to conventional size wafers.</p>
<p>The facility must be upgraded and modified to accommodate rapid changes in technology equipment and facility usage needs. The following link contains typical tools that the facility currently accommodates: http://www.cnst.nist.gov/nanofab/nanofab_equipment/equipment_list.html</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire construction and fit-up work in the AML, including all laboratory and specialized laboratory space to ensure that the AML remains the most advanced measurement laboratory.</p>
<p>Special Conditions:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-13-Q-1615 is being issued as an unrestricted Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Yankton, SD, for a Base Year period 6/1/2013-5/31/2014 with four (4) One-Year Options.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the South Dakota Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA Beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for fifteen (15) calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates.

This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteran's/families' expense.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific<br />USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 


(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions. Proposals, which are so deficient in this area, as to not warrant further consideration, will be considered nonresponsive and will be rejected. The RRB will notify the offeror as soon as possible. To be considered responsive, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified in Section V, "Submission of Proposals/Quotations". Offerors whose proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB's discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting additional clarifying or supplemental information. B. Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response. Accordingly, the objective of this evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work and the required proposal format and content, Section V, "Submission of Proposals/Quotations". C. The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a contract or Order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best Value to the Government with price and other factors listed below considered. The relationship of the evaluated technical factors (1, past performance, 2, value added) to price will be 1:1. Following the evaluation of proposals, the RRB will select the proposal providing the best value to the RRB. 1. Technical Evaluation Calculation of the technical score (100 possible points) will be accomplished by adding the points awarded for each rated area below: a. Past Performance (60 possible points)The RRB will evaluate the Past Performance of each offeror using the risk matrix below: Past Performance Risk Matrix: The following past performance risk ratings will be used to evaluate past performance: (See Attached Solicitation Document for the Past Performance Risk Matrix). Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will receive a neutral rating for past performance. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all, including sources outside of the Government. b. Value-Added (40 possible points) RRB will evaluate and assign Value-added points to those offerors that are Certified Microsoft Gold Partners and provide proof of their certification with their proposal submission. RRB will also evaluate any offered additional training or other services that would be advantageous to the RRB under the Agreement. 2. Price Evaluation Calculation of the price score (100 possible points) for each offer will be computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated price of all technically acceptable offers received by the Board to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated. Offerors' Primary and Alternate Price Offers will be evaluated as separate offers and will be given individual price scores for each offer submitted. The total evaluated price is calculated by adding the sum of all CLINS, including options. The RRB may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the RRB to exercise the option(s).D. The RRB intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However the RRB may conduct discussions with those offerors considered to be in the competitive range. E. The RRB anticipates awarding a single contract for the base year with two (2) one (1) year option periods as a result of this solicitation. F. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the RRB may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />VII. ATTACHMENTS<br />A. Attachment 1: Microsoft license inventory<br />B. Attachment 2: Certification of EIT Accessibility <br />C. Attachment 3: Notification of PIV Requirements <br /><br />*************************************************************************<br /><br />Amendment A1 issued 5/2/2013 - Extended due date for offers to 5/10/2013 at 9:00 AM CDT (Chicago local) and made changes to offer submission instructions and attachment 1 - See posted documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<DESC><p>**********************************************************************<br />Amendment 0001 changes the statement of work in reference to CLIN 0003, 0009, and 0022 (Services, Sea Valves, and Steel renewal).&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this is a net reduction in scope (Addition: a. steam supply b. clad weld tank 6-104-1 Reduction: a. telephones b. Garbage chute removal &amp; insert c. 6-65-1 insert). <br />&nbsp;The CMA security letter is not required for drydock work, so it is not included. <br />Disk with all electronic drawings were delivered at shipcheck. <br />Complete revised copy of ATTN2 TSGB DRYDOCK SOW is attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VENDORS QUESTIONS WITH MARAD RESPONSES FOLLOW:<br />VENDOR QUESTION # 1: On page 25 of the specifications under paragraph 13 Hours of Work, it states that the hours of work will be 0700 hrs until 1700 hrs.&nbsp; In a dry-docking availability like this one ship yards usually have a limited second shift to ensure timely completion of all work.&nbsp; Is a second shift authorized? <br />MARAD RESPONSE #1:<br />The second shift needs to be identified as to number of hours and cost per hour and number of men and how they will be monitored (eg: Second shift foreman).&nbsp; The idea is that we want to have a fixed labor cost if at all possible at straight time rather than overtime or premium time payments.&nbsp; Vendor would need to&nbsp; show how the second shift is truly efficient and benefits the completion of the job.</p>
<p>VENDOR QUESTION #2: CLIN 004 Dry-docking. Is there a docking plan available in electronic for the bidders?<br />MARAD RESPONSE QUESTION #2:<br />The Dock plan was delivered along with most referenced plans at the Shipcheck/Pre-solicitation conference.</p>
<p>VENDOR QUESTION #3: CLIN 016 Blast and Coat 3-174-1 &amp;2 Ballast Tanks.&nbsp; Could you give the approximately square footage and capacity of these tanks?<br />MARAD RESPONSE QUESTION #3<br />Capacity of the tank is: 3-174-1: 351 cu-m or 92,064 Gal 3-174-2: 96,341 Gal 365 cu-m 3-188-0: 18,812 Gal or 71 cu-m</p>
<p>VENDOR QUESTION #4: CLIN 017 Blast and Coat 3-188-0 Ballast Tank.&nbsp; Could you give the approximately square footage and capacity of this tank?<br />MARAD RESPONSE QUESTION #4<br />Square footage not available</p>
<p>VENDOR QUESTION #5: CLIN 022 Steel Renewals and Hull Welding.&nbsp; What fluid is usually in this tank # 6-65-1?<br />MARAD RESPONSE QUESTION #5<br />Normal fluid in Tank # 6-65-1 is:&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh water, but this tank has been changed to 6-104-1 in amendment</p>
<p>The solicitaton closing date remains 5/31/13 and all other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br />*******************************************************************************<br /></p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Current work details read: 

"Contractor to provide on-site pest control services for at least (16) hours per week, eight (8) hours a day and eight (8) hours a night at each site, Brockton, West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, weekly.  Jamaica Plain facility will be performed eight(8) hours on Saturdays. 

Now reads:

 2 days at 4 hours each and 2 evenings at 4 hours each so that four days per week are covered, 2 days at night and 2 during the day.  This would be for each campus Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury and Brockton. JP will still be performed on Saturdays. 

Questions from interested vendors and responses below:

Q: Who has the contract now, or has had previously?

A: Burgess Pest Management

Q: Is there a pre-bid meeting and/or site walk-through? It does not mention this.
A: Thursday May, 9 2013-Jamaica Plain (9:00 AM), West Roxbury (11:00 AM), Brockton (2:00 PM)
Q: Bedbugs, nuisance wildlife, & wood destroying insects (WDO) are all to be included with the normal scope of service?
 A: Treatment of bed bugs and termites or other (WDO) are separate.  This means we will call when needed and can be billed separately.
Q: Based on #2, how many bedbug, nuisance wildlife, and WDO service calls were performed last year or if possible on average over the last 3yrs. 
A:  N/A based on response to question 2. These are either separate credit card purchases or purchase orders.
Q: By law we must provide 48hrs (minimal) to allow people to prepare for a bedbug treatment. It is also common practice to allow the same amount of time to prepare for a K-9 bedbug inspection. Aside from the laws & best practices it just makes for a more successful treatment.
A:  I'm not sure if this 48 hour window is for residential only?  In a hospital, we need to minimize downtime and get patient procedure areas back up and running ASAP.  SOW calls for 24 hour response to treat if needed and 2 hour response to inspect to determine what needs to be done if anything.
Q:  Bed bugs are a specialized treatment. Would the government consider making it a separate line item?
A:  Only the inspection will be included in the contract. The treatment will be either a separate purchase order or credit card purchase.

<DESC>Market Research/Request for Information: The F-16 FMS Contracting Office, Hill AFB, UT is requesting information from interested sources about a potential requirement for an evolutionary software update to an F-16 Fleet's Operational Flight Program (OFP) from initial production version M4.3 to OFP M6.2 for the Polish Air Force's (PlAF) Advanced F-16 Fighter Block 52+ C &amp; D model aircraft. This request is to obtain information to determine if responsible sources exist that would allow this requirement to be competed or set-aside for small business. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $35.5M. The Government intends to use the information submitted in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy for this requirement. The Government is interested in receiving responses from all interested sources including 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, hubzone, and women-owned small business concerns. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. <br />Modular Mission Computer (MMC)-based architecture of the F-16 allows for evolution and continuously improving OFP product. Significant improvements including new capabilities have been developed since the Polish Air Force took initial delivery of their F-16s. The Republic of Poland Armament Inspectorate F-16 Program Office has requested an M6 OFP Upgrade to ensure Poland maintains commonality with USAF to maximize Poland's operational and logistical benefits. The Government has limited rights to the OFP data associated with the Poland OFP modernization program and is unable to provide data associated with this effort to interested offerors. The contractor will be required to perform the required engineering, develop kits for kit proofing in-country, deliver kit re-procurement drawings with unlimited government rights, provide familiarization of the modification implementation, provide source data to update the Country Specific Technical Orders, and TCTO data. <br />Interested sources should respond to this RFI and describe your technical approach for accomplishing this requirement. Your response should include a description of your past five (5) years experience with the F-16 and identify any major cost, schedule, and risk drivers associated with your technical approach. Any cost information provided in response to this RFI will not be binding. Your response should also identify your small business status for the above identified NAICS code. Also, please identify if you anticipate using teaming arrangements along with a breakout of the work to be accomplished by the prime and each team member. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information requested except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs. It is anticipated all information received in response to this RFI will be unclassified. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as company private or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the Government. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the Government's review of their responses. Interested parties must respond in writing. Your response to this request must be submitted no later than&nbsp;7 Jun 2013, addressed to Linda J. Andrews via e-mail (Linda.andrews@hill.af.mil). If you have questions, or require additional information, contact Linda J. Andrews, Contracting Officer. <br />

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been ?substantially transformed? in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered ?substantially transformed? based solely on its integration into IT or other systems <BR> <BR>

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 557 - Dublin, GA is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2512(a)) (TAA), Federal acquisitions of supplies may be made only from offerors that will supply products of an eligible country under any of the free trade agreements entered into pursuant to the TAA. An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s).

<CONTACT>Jessica T. Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone 2022542274, Email jessica.wilson@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a Sole Source Procurement. This is not a Request for Quotes or Proposals. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&amp;T), Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), has an immediate requirement to obtain continuous services for Security Visitor Control and Security Guard Services at the PIADC facility, while Federal Protection Services (FPS) conducts a competitive procurement for security services at PIADC. The incumbent Protection Strategies Incorporated (PSI), 2300 9th Street South, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22204-2387, is currently performing on a contract which will expire on April 30, 2013. FPS will not award a new contract before the current contract expires. The security guard services are a critical function and any lapse therein would pose grave security risk for DHS and the PIADC facility.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish PIADC's mission it is imperative that its employees and guests be provided a safe and secure environment in which to work. Protection Strategies Incorporated (PSI) is the only viable source that can provide continuity of services for an effective and efficient transition to the next contract as it is not feasible to compete the requirement for services required for this short period of time.</p>
<p>Protection Strategies Incorporated (PSI) has been the prime contractor since November 1, 2007. Their extensive security knowledge and familiarity with the requirement makes them the only practical contractor for this transition period. Additionally, the required DHS background (Entrance on Duty) determination could not be completed in time for another vendor to begin performance of this work by April 30th. The proposed 6 month base can occur without start-up and transition costs that would be associated with bringing another contractor on board as no vendor has the resources, knowledge, and ability to perform this work immediately without passing along significant costs to the Government.</p>
<p>The current contract ends April 30, 2013 and no additional extensions existing on the contract. To prevent a lapse in this mission critical service, the government intends to issue a sole source contract for: (1) six month base period (April 1, 2013 - October 31, 2013); if FPS has not awarded a new contract by the end of this base period, the Government will exercise (1) six month option (November 1, 2013 - April 30, 2014); or (1-2) three month options, option one (November 1, 2013 - January 31, 2014), and/or if required, option two (February 1, 2014 - April 30, 2013).</p>
<p>It is the government's intent to issue a sole sources award to the incumbent contractor, Protection Strategies Incorporated (PSI), 2300 9th Street South, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22204-2387.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above vendor directly. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available and telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Written challenges may be directed to Jessica Wilson via email at jessica.wilson@hq.dhs.gov. If no responsive challenges are received by April 23, 2013, the contract will be awarded to Protection Strategies Incorporated (PSI) without further notice.</p>
<p>NOTICE&nbsp;05/06/2013: Solicitation HSHQDC-13-Q-00144 has been cancelled in its entirety.&nbsp; The current contract HSHQDC-08-D-00001 was extended for six month, with the option to extend for up to 90 days, if the recompete contract is not awarded.&nbsp; The J&amp;A for sole source has been attached.</p>

<DESC>The Headquarters Pacific Air Forces Command (PACAF) Aircrew Flight Equipment office is hosting an Advanced Planning Brief to Industry (APBI) three-day Industry Day event and July 23-25, 2013 to provide interested companies an opportunity to receive briefings about current and future priorities and requirements, meet with Air Force, Army, and Navy representatives and ask questions about direction, priorities, requirements and processes. Companies are invited to present new products, technologies and/or improvements to existing products that will benefit the PACAF aviation communities. A list of members attending from each service and component will be E-mailed to each industry member attending 10 days prior to the event. The HQ PACAF AFE office is the lead organization for all Air Force Aircrew Flight equipment within the Pacific region with responsibility for identifying mission ready equipment for Aircrew survival.
<p>The following areas of industry are key interest to HQ PACAF AFE personnel, based on validated needs and requirements from the PACAF flying community: <br />&bull; Survival Vest, Body Armor, Survival Vest Components<br />&bull; Ballistic Helmets, Light Weight Helmets, Helmet cueing systems, Helmet Mounted Systems, Helmet mounted devices<br />&bull; Night Vision, Night vision lighting for aircrew use, <br />&bull; CBRN clothing and equipment, <br />&bull; Cold Weather Sleeping Systems, <br />&bull; Flight Clothing, Flight Gloves, <br />&bull; Exposure Suits, Extreme Cold Weather suits, <br />&bull; Ejection Seat modernization, <br />&bull; Parachutes, <br />&bull; One-Man Life Rafts, Multi-Place Life Rafts, <br />&bull; Non-munitions type signaling devices, <br />&bull; Electronic communications devices.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of this industry day is to discuss capability gaps, end user needs, current and future requirements and flight safety standards - and align them with industries current capability or technology available in the market. As our strategic outlook and budgets are changing, the aviation community is looking to improve efficiencies, implement dual-use items wherever possible as well as general and specific measures to further reduce weight, manpower, and lifecycle sustainment cost.<br />Note: Any new products or product improvements introduced need to integrate with existing flight equipment (G-suit, survival vest, etc.) and need to comply with other flight safety criteria. The Berry Amendment according to 10 U.S.C. 2533a and DFARS 225.7002 applies.</p>
<p>One-on-One meetings with HQ PACAF and services representative are offered as part of this APBI, and are currently limited to the first 40 respondents. During this event, Industry will be able to show case their items at a vendor area where base members will be invited along with all military members on Island to visit and discuss products.</p>
<p>A nominal registration fee will be required. A registration confirmation will include event location, as well as entry and exit requirements for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam facilities and other pertinent information. Please have all requests to the POC by COB 1 June 2013. Registration documents will required to be returned by 1 July 2013.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION, RFQ OR PROMISE TO PURCHASE. THIS IS A NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The HQ-PACAF AFE has no funded requirements in our program at this time, and the purpose of this meeting is a market survey of new and emerging technologies, as well as reviewing available Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) items that may apply to current and future mission needs. <br />Any formal solicitations and/or resulting procurements will be announced separately. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this notice nor reimburse any Party attending or participating for costs incurred for this event.</p>

Structure S-275 construction must be complete and accepted by the Government prior to commencing work on Structure S-273.  The demolition and reconstruction efforts will require the installation of an earthen cofferdam within Lake Okeechobee and a steel sheet pile cofferdam at the landside of each culvert in order to dewater the construction sites.  The S-273 and S-275 structures will include cast-in-place reinforced concrete foundations, headwalls and culvert barrels (with steel liners).  Combination flap/slide gates will be installed at the lakeside headwalls of each structure.  S-273 will consist of two (2) 10-foot diameter cluverts and S-275 will consist of three (3) 10-foot diameter culverts, each approximately 176 feel long.  A cutoff wall will also be installed in the centerline of the embankment at both structures and the embankment reconstructed to match the existing crest elevation of the dike.  Riprap will be installed along the lakeside embankment face and a control building will be installed at the landside work platform at each structure.  S-273 will include the installation of lakeside groins.  Work also includes by-pass pumping, grassing and turbidity monitoring.    <br>    <br>  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:    <br>  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  Proposals will be evaluated in the areas of technical merit, past performance, small business participation and price.    <br>    <br>  Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.

This sole source contract is required for Architect-Engineering services for the completion of the design of Van Vorrhis Mudge Elementary School, Fort Knox, Kentucky. The required completion date is 450 days from issuance of notice to proceed. <br>  <br> The 15% design effort for Van Vorrhis Mudge Elementary School has already been completed by RSH, and will be used as the starting point for completing the rest of the design effort up to the final design. The contract used to award the 15% design was awarded as a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) with a base year and four (4) option years for Architect Engineering Support to the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), both CONUS and OCONUS, with a maximum capacity of $12,000,000. This contract has capacity remaining, but has expired. <br>  <br> The work consists of performing the remaining Engineering, Design, and Support services necessary to complete the development and approval of construction plans and specifications for the Van Vorrhis Mudge Elementary School, Fort Knox, Kentucky in strict compliance with the requirements included in the approved DD Form 1391 for the project and the 15% design already completed by RSH. This action is to complete the required design to create construction level plans and specifications to allow award of a construction contract. RSH will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action. <br>  <br> The plans and specifications have been prepared in accordance with the Department of Defense Education Association (DoDEA) 21st Century Educational Concepts, DoDEA Facility Education Specifications, local school district program requirements, the Fort Knox installation's design guide, the USACE design guide, and integration of the geographic conditions and site constraints. The design shall also include a comprehensive interior design package. The effort includes design review conferences at 35%, 65%, final, and design complete stages, as well as presentations to the DoDEA Design Center and DoDEA Leadership at specified design intervals. An option for construction phase services in support of Van Vorrhis Elementary School is included in this contract. The construction phase services will enable the Designer of Record (DOR) to provide critical support throughout the construction process including, but not limited to, responding to request for information/support by the Resident Office overseeing construction, reviewing shop drawings, and performing site visits. Participation in the construction phase services will also enable the DOR to identify and capture lessons learned to be incorporated back into the programming and standard design specifications being developed by the DoDEA Design Center staff.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
   
1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                       Office of Acquisition Operations
                                       Technology Acquisition Center
                                       260 Industrial Way West
                                       Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2. Description of Action: The proposed action is for a 3-month Firm-Fixed Price contract, with two, 1-month options, to avoid a break in the Office of Research and Development (ORD) Support Services for the Research and Development (R&D) Initiative with Veterans Enterprise Technology Solutions, Inc. (VETS). 

3. Description of Supplies or Services: The Office of Information and Technology provides customer service support for the ORD as part of the Secretary's Major Initiatives, specifically the R&D Initiative.  This support includes upgrades and maintenance of several proprietary software applications, as well as the analysis of software architecture design at 115 VA facilities nationwide.  The proposed action will provide continued support to bridge the gap between the expiration of the existing agreement and the award of the follow-on action being competed under VA's Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology (T4) contract.  REDACTED                                      

4. Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C.3304 (a)(5), "Authorized or Required by Statute", as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  

5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed source for this action is VETS, 367 Triple C Drive, Clarksville, VA 23927, a registered and verified SDVOSB in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database.  VA is planning to award a new competitive Task Order under T4, in the coming months, for all the services that are currently supported by VETS.  A short-term contract with VETS needs to be executed to ensure there is no disruption to the services prior to the new T4 award.  VETS is uniquely qualified to provide the required bridge services as it is currently performing this support with fully trained staff in place. The systems that require the support services are unique to VA ORD. VETS possesses the application knowledge and technical expertise required to support this project. In light of the above, the Government's technical experts have determined that VETS is capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements and is considered a responsible SDVOSB.  If VA competed this bridge requirement, any other source would require a project "ramp up" time for onboarding and knowledge transferring which would take approximately 5 months and will result in a break of service. The facilities where these services are performed require the onboarding processes to be completed and a Personal Identity Verification card to be issued before access is granted to the secure site. As stated in the market research section below, delays in background investigations are common. If another vendor is selected for this bridge effort, additional risk would be incurred as the new contractor's staff will not fully understand the intent and context of the complex requirements included in the subject support services and by the time they were up to speed, it would be time to transition the services, yet again, to the T4 awardee. The Government's Technical Experts have determined that another contractor could not complete these processes and still provide substantial benefit to the Government during this period.

6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  While other SDVOSB contractors are capable of performing similar work, this effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements in the timeframe required. Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action shall be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7. Actions to Increase Competition: No barriers to future competition are anticipated. A competitive Task Order is anticipated to be awarded by September 2013 on T4 and future acquisitions will be awarded on a competitive basis.

8. Market Research: REDACTED

9. Other Facts: The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of the statute 38 U.S.C 8127(c).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000 threshold, VETS is a responsible SDVOSB, and a fair and reasonable price will offer a best value to the Government.

<DESC>This is for the contract work entitled "Force on Force Estimation and Analysis of KPPs (FREAK). The intent of this effort is to provide continuity (a "bridge") for performance between the existing work under the Modeling and Simulation Information Analysis Center technical area task (ending 31 Mar 2013) and follow-on work under the DTRA Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, which has not yet been awarded. This effort focuses on software code development, Federated Architecture integration, and event scenario planning and execution in support of the Research and Development Directorate's (J9) comprehensive Real-Time Reachback exercise. This event will assess J9's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) detector technology performance, Radio Frequency (RF) network communications capabilities, common operating picture visualization, and simulated / calibration source spectrum analytics.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intents to issue a sole source purchase order under the authority of 13.106-1(b) to:
<p>DrugPak, LLC.<br />P.O. Box 51174 <br />Knoxville, TN 37950-1174</p>
<p>For the following brand name software:<br />Product: DrugPak<br />Version: 6.x<br />Vendor: DrugPak - Small Business<br />Website: http://www.drugpak.com/</p>
<p>1) Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent Federal agency established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to regulate civilian use of nuclear materials. NRC's mission is to regulate the nation's civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, to promote the common defense, security, and to protect the environment. The Office of Administration (ADM), Division and Facilities and Security (DFS), Personnel Security Branch (PSB), is responsible for the overall management of the federally mandated NRC Drug Testing Program. Currently, there are three (3) separate applications used to track and manage the drug testing program and create random drug test pools. EDTTS is an outdated Clipper database that creates random drug test pools and track results for NRC employees. EDTTS was tested in the Consolidated Test Facility with Windows 7 and will not work in that operating system. Randomware is a COTS software package that is used to create random drug test pools for contractors. IPSS was supposed to replace EDTTS but was not implemented fully. IPSS will be replaced by the Personnel Security Adjudication Tracking System (PSATS) and the drug testing program will not be part of that system.</p>
<p>2) Scope of Work</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to purchase commercial item software licenses and services to replace the current 3 applications supporting the drug testing program with a single solution for creating random drug test pools and tracking drug test results for employees and contractors. This will improve functionality, data integrity and reporting capabilities for managing the Drug Testing Program.</p>
<p>DrugPak will provide the NRC with Case Management software licenses for 5 concurrent users configured for end-to-end recording, tracking, and processing drug test cases and creating random drug test lists that meet the general feature requirements. They will also provide technical and user documentation for software which will include all special configurations required during installation of hardware and software, database configuration, and network.</p>
<p>DrugPak will also provide software maintenance, upgrades, new releases, data conversion, over the phone Consulting Services, custom programming, and provide one training session onsite at the NRC that shall last no more than 8 hours at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, MD.</p>
<p>3) Period of Performance</p>
<p>Base Year - June 1, 2012 - May 30, 2013 <br />Option Year 1 - June 1, 2013 - May 30, 2014<br />Option Year 2 - June 1, 2014 - May 30, 2015 <br />Option Year 3 - June 1, 2015 - May 30, 2016<br />Option Year 4 - June 1, 2016 - May 30, 2017</p>
<p>4) Justification<br /><br />&nbsp;The NRC is procuring DrukPak 6.0 on a sole source basis because no other software product has been found to meet the following salient physical, functional, or performance:</p>
<p>1. Configurable commercially available case management software solution configured for end-to-end recording and tracking of personnel drug testing cases from intake, case entry processing, random drug testing test pools and test groups generation, entering test results, review and reporting.</p>
<p>2. The software must run in the Windows 7 operating system.</p>
<p>3. Web-based software that is compatible with Internet Explorer 8.x or above.</p>
<p>4. The system shall have an internal random number generation logarithm that is in compliance with CITE 49CFR382.305 Subpart (i) (Department of Transportation TITLE 49) <br />"(i) The selection of drivers for random alcohol and controlled substances testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with drivers' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each driver shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made."</p>
<p>5. The system shall allow the user to import the employee data file into the database.</p>
<p>6. The system shall allow the user to input biographical and employment information for NRC Applicants and Contractors for drug testing prior to starting employment.</p>
<p>7. The system shall uniquely identify each case within DTTS by generating a required master case number that is associated with all activities related to the person.</p>
<p>8. The system shall automatically generate "Test Groups" separating each employee into a test group based on their NRC Locale code.</p>
<p>9. The system shall allow the user to select an entire NRC Remote Site as a "Test Group".</p>
<p>10. The system shall generate selected number of test pools per year.</p>
<p>11. The system shall allow the user to tailor drug pools by selecting the percentage of employees to test for drugs and then select the frequency at which the selection should be randomized.</p>
<p>12. The system shall automatically generate a list of randomly selected names of people to be tested based on the percentage provided.</p>
<p>13. Reporting to identify missed candidates within the random pool</p>
<p>14. The system shall generate a separate list for NRC Contractors.</p>
<p>15. The system shall track individual drug test results.</p>
<p>16. The system shall maintain the results of each drug test for a period specified by the user.</p>
<p>The system shall generate individual follow-up testing schedules with user-specified parameters.</p>
<p>17. The system shall generate individual follow-up testing schedules with user-specified parameters.</p>
<p>18. The system shall be able to create, maintain and protect from modification to unauthorized access or destruction and audit trail of accesses to the objects it protects. The audit data shall be protected so that read access to it is limited to those who are authorized.</p>
<p>19. Software cannot be a cloud base solution.</p>
<p>The required software is proprietary and exclusive to DrugPak. Further, DrugPak has no authorized resellers of their software, and does not authorize any other firm to maintain or make adjustments to its very specialized software product.</p>
<p>Please submit in writing to the Contracting Officer, Dominique Malone, at Dominique.Malone@nrc.gov any objections or questions in regards to this intent to sole source within 10 days from this notice.</p>
