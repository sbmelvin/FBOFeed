the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". To comply with DoD mandate to get better value for defense goods, a target unit price reduction of 10 percent or better is established for this requirement. This price reduction is additive to any other price benefits attributable to market conditions, economic trends and/or quantity variances. Please aggressively evaluate opportunities for reducing overhead costs, improving business practices and reducing wasteful, inefficient processes prior to submitting your offer for this requirement. -SEE NOTES 9, 22,

<p>1.0 PURPOSE</p>
<p>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to make sure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards included in this contract. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.</p>
<p>2.0 AUTHORITY</p>
<p>Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under FAR 52.212-4(a), Inspection/Acceptance; which provides for inspections and acceptance of the articles, services, and documentation called for in the contract to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.</p>
<p>3.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the contract. The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is put in place to provide Government oversight of the Contractor's quality control efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract. The QASP is not a part of the contract nor is it intended to duplicate the Contractor's Management Plan. The Government may provide the Contractor an information copy of the QASP as an Attachment to the solicitation to support the Contractor's efforts in developing its plan for maintaining the levels of quality anticipated to be delivered under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>4.0 GOVERNMENT RESOURCES</p>
<p>Contracting Officer - The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a COR is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of appointment.</p>

<p>5.0 METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP. The Performance-Based Matrix, describes the methods of surveillance that may be used to monitor the services and deliverables to be provided under the contract.</p>
<p>Customer Feedback - Customer feedback may be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed and must be forwarded to the COR. The COR shall maintain a summary log of all formally received customer complaints as well as a copy of each complaint in a documentation file. The COR shall also keep the tabulated results of all customer satisfaction surveys on file and shall enter the summary results into the Surveillance Activity Checklist.</p>
<p>Random Monitoring - Random monitoring shall be conducted if and when deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract. The COR will conduct the random monitoring.</p>
<p>Random Checks/Inspections on Completion of Workload Tasking - Random checks will be conducted to ensure compliance with the QASP Matrix. The COR will conduct the random checks.</p>
<p>6.0 IDENTIFIED QA SURVEILLANCE ITEMS</p>
<p>The PBSC items that have been identified for surveillance are identified in the Performance-Based Matrix.</p>
<p>7.0 DOCUMENTATION</p>
<p>The COR will maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government's performance of the quality assurance function. All such records will be retained for the life of this contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.</p>
<p>For each item on the QASP Matrix that does not meet acceptable levels, the Government may issue a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR). CDRs will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer with a copy sent to the contractor. The contractor must reply in writing within 5 days of receipt identifying how future occurrences of the problem will be prevented. Based upon the contractor's past performance and plan to solve the problem, the Contracting Officer will determine if any further action will be taken.</p>
<p>In accordance with the inspection of services provisions of the contract, the contractor will be incentivized to provide quality services in a timely manner since the Government can require the Contractor, at no additional cost, to replace or correct work that fails to meet contract requirements.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

Requirements for Access to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 			

(a) Contractors representatives must be United States citizens.  Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM.  Employee Eligibility Verification Form).  The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employees eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status.  Contractors can go to 
http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Security/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance.

NOTE: The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard.
  If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employees clearance status may suffice depending on the employees status within the JPAS database.  In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material.  If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

(b) VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER.

(1)	 Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.
  By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that persons citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form).  The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).

(2)	Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

(3)	Service contractor:  Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract.

(c)  IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENDOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER.
  The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

(1)	If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

(2)	 Any questions with regard to this requirement shall be addressed to the Purchasing Agent/Contract Specialist identified elsewhere on the solicitation/award document.

NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AS IT APPLIES TO NEW ACCESS REQUIREMENTS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON 1 October 2011

(d)  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
  Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening / background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis.  The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.
  Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm  (under Popular Links).
