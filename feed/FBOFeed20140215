<DESC>The USDA Forest Service (USFS), Region-6 Acquisition, Northwest Contracting Area, intends to award one (1) firm fixed-price service follow-on contract for data analysis and related services as a sole source to AMEC Environment and Infrastructure, Inc. (AMEC EII), San Diego, California, as the only responsible source pursuant to FAR subpart 6.302-1. The original contract No. AG-05G2-C-10-0009, "Smoke Emissions/Exposure Data Analysis" was previously awarded (pre-novation agreement to AMEC Environment and Infrastructure, Inc.) to AMEC Geomatrix, Inc. /Geomatrix Consultants, Inc. in May 2010. The tasks currently identified for the follow-on contract are directly related to, and a logical outgrowth of, work completed under the previously awarded contract. As such, the current needs represent a follow-on to that work. Success in effectively (cost and time) meeting the Government's current requirements hinges on the considerable investment and knowledge developed by AMEC EII as part of their investigation into the needs and acceptable project pathways developed through the earlier contract.
<p>Four project tasks comprise the Government's follow-on contract's scope of work:<br />&bull; Assist in the development of a comprehensive literature review on the occurrence and human health-related toxicity for significant published components measured in wildland fire smoke.</p>
<p>&bull; Continue and expand analysis of San Dimas Technology and Development field data (from previous contract).</p>
<p>&bull; Comprehensive risk assessment and model (based on data analysis literature review).</p>
<p>&bull; Final report composition-review-presentation.</p>
<p>AMEC EII is the only responsible source to effectively provide the necessary data analysis and related services for this project due to their previously completed work, and therefore the unique knowledge and expertise it possesses to successfully complete the current needs by building directly on that previously completed work. This contractor is uniquely qualified because of their knowledge of, and past performance related to, this project.</p>
<p>The performance period is expected to extend from date of award in March 2014 through 12/31/2015. The NAICS code is 541712-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. Any source that considers itself responsible specific to the requirements described above, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency in the context of the project's specific requirements and contracted performance history leading to the Government's current need and this notice of intent. Responses must be received by 12:00 Noon Monday, March 3, 2014 in order to be considered. Email responses to djohnson03@fs.fed.us with the subject line including "AG-05G2-S-14-0003".</p>
