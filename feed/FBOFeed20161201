<DESC><p>The objectives of this work is to develop and demonstrate prototype advanced integrated threat warning systems while also advancing electro-optic test and developmental risk reduction methodologies to supplement procurement agency milestone achievements. These objectives include testing methodologies and simulations for USAF and Department of Defense (DoD) procurement activities critically supported by the Sensors Directorate's world-class electro-optical (EO) threat warning core competencies. The work should develop and integrate test protocols and instrumentation augmenting agency developmental testing goals in the areas of laser sensor technology, missile warning, hostile fire, combat identification, and wide area surveillance sensors. Of high interest is research integrating EO threat warning system prototypes with a federated electronic warfare (EW) bus technology.</p>
<p>The TWIST program will develop and demonstrate threat warning integrated survivability technology to achieve mission assurance. The effort will develop technology plans for research and development to meet the requirements as identified in specific task areas. The program will develop and demonstrate these technologies. The program will support research and development in the following areas: <br />(1) Missile Warning Technology, <br />(2) Multi-Spectral Threat Simulation, <br />(3) Modeling and Simulation, <br />(4) Test Equipment Improvements, <br />(5) Sensor Development, and <br />(6) Risk Reduction Experiments and Characterization, <br />each with specific objectives.</p>

16.  UID: If unit price exceeds $5,000, then UID requirements are applicable. 
17.  Qualified Sources:  United Technologies Corporation (Cage 52661)
18.  Set-aside:  N/A
19.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.  Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), for DoD, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. RMS is the only available source with the appropriate technical expertise, corporate knowledge, specialized skills and trained workforce to perform the required effort in the required timeframe. Due to the long term and highly integrated involvement of RMS in Stinger field support, upgrade development, production, FMS production, and support, it is not feasible to procure this effort from another sources.<br /><br />Performance concludes 31 December 2016.</p>
<p>The period of performance (PoP) for the one-year extension will be from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.</p>

The required quantity is 2221 each to be shipped to DODACC (W25G1U) DLA Distribution New Cumberland, PA. The required delivery is 180 days. FOB Origin and Inspection and Acceptance at Destination are required. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. This material is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested suppliers may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with the commercial item with 15 days of this notice. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of December 16, 2016 (12/16/16). Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings /bid sets available. <br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, proposals will be evaluated according to "best value" procedures on the basis of Price, Past Performance and Delivery. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. <br />Surplus material will not be considered. <br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. <br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Gamma Technology to provide its simulation software, GT Suite, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures under NAICS Code 541519 - Other Computer Related Services with a small business standard of $27,000,000.00.  

The EPA has a requirement for software that allows for total engine and vehicle simulations in an integrated powertrain and vehicle platform.  This software is necessary for the EPA to perform various engine and vehicle simulations in order to effectively address many technical issues related to GHG rulemaking.  The software required by EPA must allow the user the ability to plug and play and build any engine, vehicle and combination of both into a platform to run the simulation in a cost effective manner.   The software must link vehicle with engine, and engine with engine cooling system and fuel injection system, and engine with after treatment device in a compact and integrated form. The software shall also be 100% compatible with all of the models that EPA has already built in GT-Suite. The software required by EPA has to virtually cover all components associated with engine and vehicle.  Examples include engine, after treatment devices (SCR, LNT, DOC and DPF), transmission, driveline, engine cooling system, beaning, fuel injection system, and hybrid vehicles.  

Gamma Technology, Inc is the only known source able to satisfy the software requirements for the EPA.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing this type of software may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit capabilities documentation via FedConnect website at www.fedconnect.net. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<p>ONR has a broad reaching science and technology portfolio supporting autonomous systems.&nbsp; There have been programs related to unmanned air vehicles, underwater vehicles, sea-surface vehicles, and ground vehicles.&nbsp; These efforts have involved fundamental autonomy that is domain agnostic, various sensing approaches, robotics, and kinematics.&nbsp; Research programs have involved both single platform automation and collective behaviors of multiple unmanned platforms.&nbsp; These programs have typically been single domain (air, land or sea) in a relatively homogeneous environment.</p>
<p>ONR is now interested in exploring science and technology approaches to support a range of amphibious operations that take advantage of low-cost multi-domain (sea and land) unmanned systems. ONR envision developing autonomous amphibians that will maneuver (individually and collectively) through the surf zone and emerge and navigate ashore.&nbsp; ONR&nbsp; anticipate leveraging the vast body of domain agnostic autonomy research that has been done to date and evolve it to address the stressing multi-domain environment.&nbsp; Moreover, ONR is interested in the unique Science and Technology (S&amp;T) required to autonomously maneuver, sense, and communicate in the challenging sea-land interface in varied shore environments including surf, urban, mud-flats, rocky beach, beach with obstacles, and beach vegetation such as mangroves.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of PSC, Immediate Office of the Secretary (OS-IOS) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Pairin, Inc <br />3461 Ringsby Ct <br />Denver, CO 80216</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to conduct a pilot project that enables IDEA Lab to make available a self-assessment of entrepreneurial preferences and behavioral attitudes that may inform their collaborations with IDEA Lab through its innovation programs (Ignite Accelerator, Ventures, Entrepreneur-in-Residence, and Innovator-in-Residence).</p>
<p>The IDEA Lab in the Immediate Office of the Secretary is in need of data and analysis to support and evaluate its innovation programs. This acquisition is to address individual innovator characteristics to assist with coaching and team development of project participants. In addition, analysis of the cohorts of innovation program will enable characteristics compared to non-federal innovators to demonstrate ability to recruit innovators from outside government with highly entrepreneurial features.</p>
<p>The programs of the HHS IDEA Lab have a need for self-assessment and facilitated coaching assessment capabilities conduct an evaluation include the Ignite Accelerator, Ventures program, and Innovator- and Entrepreneur-in-Residence program. We are proposing to use the service in a one year pilot project to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the tool and data to enhance our program effectiveness.</p>
<p>IDEA Lab has identified the Pairin Readiness Management System (PRMS) as a unique tool that addresses a range of innovation assessment needs. The commercial software as a system application fulfils our needs as it has been developed to address critical areas of assessment of personal behavior attributes.</p>
<p>HHS is seeking to acquire access to a platform customized to a website for IDEA Lab projects that will be used to support user access to the Pairin software, Pairin Readiness Management System (PRMS). This program is developed on the basis of a platform created by Drs. Harrison Gough, and Alfred Heilbrun of University of California-Berkley known as the Adjective Check List, a tool known for assessing personality and perceived psychological tendencies. The tool has been applied extensively in entrepreneurship training and education settings to facilitate coaching and team development.</p>
<p>Pairin will also provide training to the HHS IDEA Lab program staff and mentors on the interpretation of the reports. Pairin will also support program level analysis and relate them to their commercial database of entrepreneurship.<br />Pairin's Behavioral Testing is based on Dr. Harrison Gough's Adjective Check List (ACL). The ACL is a norm-referenced standardized test consisting of 300 adjectives and adjectival phrases commonly used to describe a person's behavioral attributes. The ACL is unique in that the required number of items checked is unspecified so adjectives selected are ones that are salient for the person being evaluated. It may be administered for a multiplicity of purposes including, but not limited to, eliciting a self-evaluation from an individual.</p>
<p>The testing tool is based on research results and data related to the reliability and validity of the ACL. Drawn from a sample size of 9,382 individuals and normalized over fifteen years, the information in this document includes reliability and validity data based on the current normative sample, an explanation of the points of application, and a summary of findings related to EEOC compliance.</p>
<p>The testing system has been validated in an array of entrepreneur settings including education and technology development. It has been deemed suitable as a valid test to assess entrepreneurship capabilities, facilitate coaching and project management capabilities. IDEA Lab has assessed this tool and found that it has well-developed capabilities and that the team of subject matter experts are poised to assist its use in IDEA Lab programs. We have not identified other data application sources that can relate innovator assessment to meet these needs.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement addressing their specific abilities regarding this requirement. The email subject line must reference OS188754. All responses are due by December 15, 2015, 10:00 AM Eastern Time and can be sent to Kevin Ceponis at Kevin.Ceponis@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA/SOURCES SOUGHT)<br />Software Support Maintenance in support of the DoD MORPHOTRUST Enterprise ABIS License<br />This is not a solicitation.
<p>U.S. Army Contracting Command - (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division, intends to award on a sole source basis a firm-fixed-price contract for the follow-on software support maintenance in support of the DoD MORPHOTRUST Enterprise ABIS License. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify potential sources that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities to manufacture and deliver the following:</p>
<p>Product Manager Biometrics Enabling Capability (PM BEC) is responsible for executing the system life cycle management responsibilities for the Army's enterprise biometrics solution for ingesting, storing, processing, matching, sharing, and managing national biometrics resources for adversaries and neutral/unknown/non-aligned population groups across the full range of military operations. These capabilities are currently provided by Department of Defense Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS) which serves as the central, authoritative enterprise repository for biometrics data collected in the field from known and suspected terrorists, along with persons of interest to the DoD. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for software support maintenance in support of the DoD MORPHOTRUST Enterprise ABIS License for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 - Software Publishers.</p>
<p>The identified software support application is integral to maintaining system operations and is the core matching software used in DoD ABIS, which is the DoD authoritative biometrics system. The MORPHOTRUST ABIS search core application is a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) biometrics matching capability that includes propriety algorithms for finger, face, palm, iris, and latent biometrics. The DoD ABIS program is built around the MORPHOTRUST ABIS COTS product and will not operate without the MORPHOTRUST ABIS search core application. Without proper maintenance, the software may not provide prompt, accurate biometrics identification of persons of interest through the DoD ABIS platform.</p>

<SUBJECT>M41 Protective Assessment Test System (PATS)
<SOLNBR>W911SR-17-R-M412

<CONTACT>Dana Y. Nunley, Phone 4438614683, Email dana.y.nunley.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Request for Information - W911SR-17-R-M412
<p>1.0 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) is requesting information from industry on its ability to modernize and upgrade the existing M41 Protective Assessment Test System (PATS) mask-fit testing devices. ECBC is issuing this RFI as part of a market survey to identify businesses with existing Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) or Government off the Shelf (GOTS) solutions meeting PATS criteria, and businesses that can integrate and test these solutions, as well as provide services for logistics (initial instrument training, training video, draft manuals, parts lists and assistance with review of Government Technical Manual production), information assurance support, and Government engineering and operational verification test support. The ECBC desires to establish a baseline of knowledge and will potentially use the information acquired from this RFI to optimize the PATS acquisition strategy to modernize the U.S. Army's mask fit test capability. The NAICS code for this RFI is 334519.</p>
<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The PATS is a military version of a commercial device designed to check the readiness of protective masks based on a miniature Condensation Nucleus Counter that continuously samples and counts individual particles that occur naturally in the surrounding air. The Army has determined through extensive user testing, military deployment, and field-use experience that condensation nucleus-counting based mask -fitting is currently the optimal system for the Army's Nuclear Biological and Chemical (NBC) Warfighting preparedness needs and integrates optimally with current Force Structure and Training. The PATS does not require special certification to use, nor does it demand the assignment of specific Military Operational Specialty (MOS) soldiers. The PATS as configured in the current system is designed to check the readiness of protective masks while being one man-portable and capable of surviving chemical biological and nuclear combat. The PATS continuously samples and counts individual particles that occur naturally in the surrounding air and does not require the introduction of special aerosols or the use of tents or chambers to assess quantitative mask fit. The PATS measures the concentration of these naturally occurring particles inside and outside the mask and verifies that: 1) the fit of the mask to the soldiers' face meets stringent fit-factor criteria, and 2) there are no critical leaks in the mask system. Additionally, the PATS can be used to help screen for unserviceable masks when a well-trained NBC Officer performs mask preventative maintenance checks and services (PMCS) in tandem with the PATS fit measurement. The Protective Assessment Test Instrument (PATI) with an accessory kit, supplies and carrying case comprise the system. PATS is used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. Army National Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force (active, guard, and reserve) and Surety Sites as well as by other Government Agencies including Department of Justice, the Department of State, and Central Intelligence Agency. The PATS modernization effort is being conducted because the current systems cannot be easily maintained or calibrated due to a constrained supply of critical calibration and maintenance repair components and the inability to manufacture specific components.</p>
<p>3.0 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The modernized PATS will have electronic components that can be serviced and calibrated based on state of the art electronic systems. The source will have system integration capability, existing production, modernization, and maintenance capability. The modernized system shall be a one-man-portable mask-fit test- validation system in a Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) carrying case that can verify fit-factors between 1 and 100,000; this system in the case must be Nuclear Biological and Chemical (NBC) survivable, Combat Survivable (resistant to vibration, drop, temperature extremes, &amp; pressure changes) and capable of being decontaminated if necessary without damage to the modernized PATS. The system in its carrying case shall be capable of surviving electromagnetic interference resulting from fallout generated by thermonuclear attack. The modernized system shall be combat-oriented and combat-capable such that it survives the rigors of the modern battlefield and asymmetric Guerilla style warfare to meet the needs of U.S. Warfighters. The modernized PATI shall not exceed dimensions of 9.5 inches long x 7.5 inches wide x 5.5 inches high. Total volume shall be less than 392 cubic inches. The carrying case shall not exceed dimensions of 16 inches x 15 inches x 10 inches. The total volume shall be less than 2400 cubic inches. The PATI shall weigh less than 4.2 lb. (1.9 kg). The test instrument in the carrying case shall weigh less than 22 lb. (10 kg). The modernized PATS shall have an external battery capability utilizing either Lithium Manganese Dioxide Power Sources standard to the Army (Military 6135-01-090-5364 Battery, BA-5347/U) or a D Cell Alkaline Battery power source. The Modernized PATS must be able to fit-test the M50 Joint Service General Purpose Masks (JSGPM) and the M50 series Joint Service Aircrew Masks (JSAM). Additional requirements for the prototypes are contained in the Operational Requirements Document-Catalogue of Approved Requirements Documents System (CARDS) reference index 1265, (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>The modernized PATS will have electronic components that can be serviced and calibrated based on state of the art electronic systems. The Offeror shall explain how to calibrate the system being proposed and explain the recommended calibration frequency. The Offeror shall provide reliability parameters and have test data to substantiate Mean Time between Failure and the required calibration interval of no less than 18 months. The calibration procedures shall be explained in depth including the time to develop, install, systemize [shake down procedures]; and the projected cost. Use of existing calibration facilities is desired to reduce life-cycle cost but is not mandatory [current facilities are located in Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, three (3) and Kaiserslautern, Germany, two (2)]. Any calibration system shall be explained in full in terms of cost and schedule to develop as well as cost and schedule to install the calibration systems.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall have the ability to travel to Redstone, Kaiserslautern, Aberdeen Proving Ground-Edgewood Area (APG-EA), MD to support Government engineering and operational verification testing. The Government will require a minimum of 390 modernized PATS systems for initial production. The systems shall be delivered to Government facilities according to a schedule to be mutually agreed upon between the source and ECBC within 4 months of contract. Instruments to be delivered will be in a Chemical Agent Resistant Coated Case or a combat resistant case that survives ASTM 4169 packaging tests.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall address cost and schedule for relevant mask fit test system and sub-component systems, calibration systems. The Offeror should be able to explain the time frame to provide production items for additional engineering technical tests and additional limited operational verification tests. The Offeror shall discuss any barriers to production , long lead times of mask fit test items and explain production of mask fit test devices and calibration equipment and calibration software to support fielding 9000 instrument systems in CARC cases to the U.S. Army over the next 5 years.</p>

A significant increase in the demand for complete worldwide Terminal Procedure coverage necessitates a need to transform the production of Terminal Procedures by providing a repository of Unpublished Graphics (UPG), and Terminal Instrument Procedures, which are not currently published in DoD Flight Information Publications (FLIP). <br />Aeronautical data published by NGA consists of hard and soft copy products, both of which are utilized for mission planning, aircraft navigation, and within flight management systems. Production of Aeronautical data is provided on a 28-day cycle (See Appendix E), as well as on an ad-hoc basis. It is NGA's goal to maintain a complete worldwide Terminal repository of Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs), Standard Instrument Departures Procedures (SIDs), and Standard Terminal Arrival Charts (STARs).<br />

<DESC>Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) their small business type (e.g. HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses); and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under an applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this sources sought notice, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in any future contract and Task Order awarded.</p>
<p>NIAID&nbsp;anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that provides a guaranteed minimum award to the organization or consortium that best meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of this sources sought notice. Task Orders for specific tasks will be issued after award of the Basic Contract.</p>

<DESC>Description:  <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The EnVision plate reader has been a critical component in support of many important NCATS projects. The EnVision offers many different reading modes, including fluorescence intensity (top and bottom), absorbance, luminescence, fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence/FRET and TRF-laser. The TRF-laser offers a high level of sensitivity that is critical for TRND's Zika research which leans heavily on the TRF technology.</p>
<p>This EnVision would replace a pre-existing EnVision in the TRND laboratory, which is experiencing a loss of functionality. A new reader is needed to continue to move research forward, without a loss of continuity.</p>

Please note, the site is considered an active construction site while the construction contractor is still performing work.  Personnel that will be providing installation services will be required to wear safety gear such as hard hats, over the ankle boots, reflective safety vests, eye protection, and gloves.  The Contractor will be required to coordinate delivery or delivery/installation (as applicable) with the designated Contracting Officer s Representative (COR) after award.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT  #VA701-17-N-0043
The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources that can provide miscellaneous scientific equipment as part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new VA Medical Center in Aurora, CO.  Items are separated into groupings below as they are expected to be grouped in future solicitations.

The scope of work will include delivery to the destination (FOB Destination).  Some items may require installation. Interested vendors will be asked to identify whether they are able to provide installation in addition to delivery of the item. Vendors will provide this information as a part of the attached excel spreadsheet, titled Interested Vendor Response Summary, which they will complete and return with their submission.  Please note, the site is considered an active construction site while the construction contractor is still performing work.  Personnel that will be providing installation services will be required to wear safety gear such as hard hats, over the ankle boots, reflective safety vests, eye protection, and gloves.  The Contractor will be required to coordinate delivery or delivery/installation (as applicable) with the designated Contracting Officer s Representative (COR) after award.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">For planning purposes, a preliminary estimation of agency needs indicates a potential annual demand for approximately 200,000 to 250,000 pairs of athletic shoes to be delivered at the rate of approximately 27,500 pairs per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Two DRAFT Purchase Descriptions Including: "GL-PD-16-06", Shoe Athletic, dated 18 Nov 2016" and "AF PD-17xxxx undated, Shoe Lightweight Athletic", are included as part of this RFI and they are intended to provide competitive descriptions of the military service's athletic shoe requirements. These documents are subject to change. Industry comment and feedback on each of these technical requirements is requested and encouraged to ensure that these are competitive purchase descriptions that will adequately enable the government to discern differences among product offerings and that they <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>contain relevant and meaningful product descriptions, evaluation and testing criteria that ensure that high quality athletic shoes are procured and that a consistent level of quality is maintained throughout any potential resultant contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In order to assess the marketplace, we request interested providers identify their athletic footwear that are currently being sold in the commercial marketplace, or those that can be made available to the DoD that would meet the requirements in the attached DRAFT PDs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of those athletic shoes that meet the DoD draft requirements, DoD also needs to understand which of those athletic shoes are currently, or will be, Berry Amendment compliant by DoD's anticipated need date. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In order to assist the industry in framing their responses/comments on the attached DRAFT PDs and the availability of athletic footwear, please provide specific responses to the questions listed below: </span></p>

<SOLNBR>FR17RPD30000000002
<RESPDATE>121616
<CONTACT>Devona Jackson, Email devona.jackson@dot.gov
<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Academy of Science's (NAS) Transportation Research Board (TRB) to provide support services for technical assistance and information dissemination to the public transportation community. The period of performance will be for one year, with an option for an additional year. The justification is as follows. The long established status of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) as a noncompetitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government derives from its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by E.O. 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the NAS was most recently formally recommended in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to Government and its unique capacity to martial scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science policy advice. The NAS has the unique ability to assemble the Nation's most eminent scholars, who serve as volunteers without compensation on committees and boards, which are then able to render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national problems of high priority. Accordingly, only NAS can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity and audience acceptance necessary to meet our program requirements.</p>

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.
  Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. 

Requested are responses to the following: 
(1) Which trades are expected to be employed on large scale construction projects? 
a. Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?
(2) What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this type project or type of construction?

a. Are the other projects in the vicinity going to limit the pool of skill labor available for your project? 
(4) Have projects like these been done before in the local market? 
(5) What investments have been made to support registered apprenticeship programs? 
(6) Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public or private sector in this geographic region? Have PLAs been used on these types of projects in other regions? 
(7) Which CBAs are likely to expire during the course of these projects under consideration that might cause delays? (local building trades and contractors can provide information) 
(8) How do prevailing wage rates in the local market compare to Davis Bacon rates? 
a.
 What impact does unionization in the local market have on wages? 
(9) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways? 
a. Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs? 
b. Minimizing disruptions that may arise due expiration of CBA? 
c. Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce? 
d. Allowing for changes in apprentice to journeyman ratio. 
e. Serving as a management tool that ensures highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way? 
f. Other? 
(10) Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways? 
a. Mechanisms to avoid delays 
b.
 Complying with labor standards, safety rules and EEO laws. 
c. Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers. 
(11) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project? 

Responses shall be submitted via email to Kate Dinneen at Katherine.dinneen@navy.mil no later than 10:00 AM EST on Thursday, 8 December 2016. 

This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.

<DESC>Senior Navy leadership is in the early stages of exploring the feasibility of using a block buy approach to affordably execute Cruiser Modernization availabilities. To that end, and in accordance with FAR Section 15.201, the Navy leadership intends to meet initially with a limited group of Senior Leadership in the ship repair industry to give the Navy an opportunity to receive feedback from that industry leadership on matters relating to their capabilities, workloads, limitations and concerns for execution of the block buy for Cruiser Modernization. This initial meeting, which will be limited to invited, qualified Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) contractors who can perform the work as a prime contractor, will be held with the Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of the invited MSRA holders. As the exploration of the block buy approach progresses, subsequent meetings with other ship repair industry participants will be held at appropriate levels of authority within the Navy and industry. The Government will not reimburse costs for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement.

<p><br />This is a Sources Sought Notice announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. There is no formal solicitation at this time.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the Market Survey will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosure to non-Government personnel and entities. Your interest in this response is appreciated.</p>
<p>The Crane division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking prospective sources for information to meet requirements on Real-time Position Monitoring for Test Track. The system must meet the basic requirements listed below and function in the defined operating environment. Additional operating characteristics are desired but not necessary for a minimal system.</p>
<p>Detailed information needs to identify the operating temperature range, humidity range, and whether it will operate in rain fall. It must operate during nighttime as well as daylight.</p>
<p>Operating Environment: The system should function in an RF congested environment that has the potential for interference. GPS may not be available in some situations.<br /><br />Basic Requirements:<br />1. The system must function in the defined operating environment.<br />2. The system required would give real-time position information for a test subject located within a 1km testing area.<br />3. The system should be lightweight, small, mobile and battery powered.<br />4. The system should provide the positional information back to a central monitoring site where computers and power are available</p>
<p>Additional Desired Characteristics:</p>
<p>The system should also have the following characteristics:<br />1. The position information, binary input status and time/date stamp should be logged to a CSV file that can be started and stopped.<br />2. A GUI that displays position information on a graphic that represents the testing area.<br />3. Remote binary inputs to the GUI at the monitoring site that can record the pass/fail results of testing.<br />4 The remote binary inputs should send the data back to the monitoring site by a fiber optic connection.<br />5 The status of the binary inputs should show on the GUI for the position of the test subject so that both are easily observable.<br />6 The position information should be in the form of decimal degrees of latitude and longitude. The controlling software must convert the positional offsets to latitude and longitude (LAT/LON). For the software to be able to do this, a LAT/LON reference point will be entered into the software during setup/initialization.<br />7 The GUI should be sufficiently automated so that a new log file can be quickly created, named and saved.</p>
<p>This is not a system development announcement. Any duplication of costs for system development including Operating Systems, firmware code, hardware, Government testing, qualification and validation will be at the contractor's expense.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should contact the designated point of contact (POC) before deciding to submit any relevant information, such as applicable product literature, features, general specifications, performance specifications, qualification and test data, rough order of magnitude pricing, and current relevant applications. POC is Steve Kirts, stephen.kirts@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Health Affairs (OHA) Biowatch Program and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Chemical Biological Defense ( CBD) will host an Industry Day Event to provide additional information on the program and the Technology Demonstration for the Biowatch Technology Enhancements (BTE) requirement on Wednesday November 30, 2016 from 9:00am to 12:00pm Eastern Time. The industry day will be held in the OHA 4th floor conference rooms at 1120 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20005.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The BioWatch Program's critical mission is to operate a nationwide, aerosol detection system providing early warning across all levels of government to support public health and emergency management communities to prepare for and respond to a biological incident. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) conducted a Request for Information (RFI) in FY15 to understand the state of the commercial market for Biological Monitoring, Collection, Identification and Characterization/Survey capabilities. Based on the responses received and an independent assessment of the market's potential, DHS is initiating the BioWatch Technology Enhancement effort to satisfy documented needs for the BioWatch program. The enhanced capabilities would improve the overall BioWatch system's ability to monitor, collect, identify, characterize and/ or survey biothreat agents of public health concern in designated jurisdictions in the United States.</p>
<p>DHS is inviting industry to participate in a Technology Demonstration expected to commence no later than early summer of 2016. The department is seeking to evaluate only mature technologies, those that are at least TRL-6 (demonstrated in an operational or relevant operational environment), against select technical parameters. The information from this activity will inform the acquisition strategy for potential follow-on phases of the Technology Enhancements effort. The information may also be used to support the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for soliciting proposals to technically and operationally demonstrate, procure, and deploy enhancements. Additionally, the type of data sets produced from the Technology Demonstration may be required to be provided by offerors as part of a future Technology Enhancements proposal to demonstrate design and system maturity. Additional information regarding these data sets is forthcoming in a future FedBizOpps announcement. Potential offerors for a Technology Enhancements requirement would be able to utilize independent 3rd party test data comparable to these data sets if they are not participants in the Technology Demonstration.</p>
<p>A Special Notice is anticipated to be issued in late winter or early spring of 2017 to request applications for Technology Demonstration participants. <br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY GOALS:<br /><br />&bull; Present an overview of the BioWatch Program<br />&bull; Describe the goals of the acquisition<br />&bull; Ensure that industry is aware of the Technology Demonstration<br />&bull; Describe the Technology Demonstration objectives and approach<br />&bull; Communicate initial requirements and timelines for Technology Demonstration participation<br />&bull; Understand industry's initial questions and concerns<br />&bull; Understand if a minimum set of robust technologies would be available for the Technology Demonstration</p>
<p>The Government may elect to post to FedBizOpps the industry day sign in sheet including company name and email and/or telephone contact information in order to facilitate information exchange between potential offerors.</p>
<p>Prospective participants planning to attend the industry day should Register here by providing your company name and contact information for each attendee. Please note: due to potential space constraints, each participating company is limited to no more than two (2) representatives. Industry Representatives should enter at the main entrance on Vermont Avenue with a photo ID and be prepared to pass through building security and metal detectors</p>
<p>(Arrival POC: CAPT Malcolm Johns).</p>
<p>Other Details:</p>
<p>All responsible sources are invited to participate but are prohibited from entering into subcontracts or teaming arrangements with National/Government laboratories or Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).</p>
<p>National/Government laboratories and FFRDCs may not propose directly as prime contractors or as subcontractors or teaming partners to prime contractors.</p>
<p>Foreign participants are also prohibited from participating in a potential solicitation as prime contractors, subcontractors or in teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>DHS makes no representation that a solicitation will be issued or that a contract award will result from a RFP, if and when issued.</p>

This requires additional constraints on who has the authority to move data, data shares are adequately resourced and managed, and versions are tracked across the systems.&nbsp; Given the increase in risk to code integrity, FDA would like to track software transmissions consistently across the enterprise.&nbsp; MOVEit software allows FDA to lessen the burden of manually monitoring and tracking code transmissions and decrease the risk to code vulnerabilities.</span></p>

This requires additional constraints on who has the authority to move data, data shares are adequately resourced and managed, and versions are tracked across the systems.&nbsp; Given the increase in risk to code integrity, FDA would like to track software transmissions consistently across the enterprise.&nbsp; MOVEit software allows FDA to lessen the burden of manually monitoring and tracking code transmissions and decrease the risk to code vulnerabilities.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-17-017 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5m. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Illumina Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122 to procure a fixed priced one year service agreement for the following Illumina instruments:<br />1. Product Care HiSeq&reg; 2500 DNA sequencer (sn: D00762) Comprehensive Plan: Includes full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent /kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge, 1PM; Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls , on-site responses shall occur w/in three business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training, Field Application Scientist Support - Standard coverage hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm pst., excluding holidays) phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support. Replacement parts/reagents and hardware/software updates/upgrades provided must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified. Coverage period start date mid to late December 2016.<br />2. Product Care MiSeq&reg; DNA sequencer (sn: M04210) Comprehensive Plan: Includes full coverage for parts, labor and travel; Reagent/kits replacement upon Hardware failures @ no charge: Remote Technical Support; Service technician/personal shall acknowledge repair request w/in 24 business hours, priority scheduling for service calls, on-site responses shall occur w/in three business days when required, Hardware/Software updates: On-site applications support; advanced application training - Standard coverage hours/days are 5x18 (M-F, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm pst., excluding holidays) phone support and 5x24 email access to Technical Support. Replacement parts/reagents and hardware/software updates/upgrades provided must be Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified. Coverage period start date mid to late December 2016.
<p>Illumina is the sole provider of service for the Illumina pieces of equipment. Only Illumina, Inc. has technical service representatives who receive comprehensive and on-going factory training and regular technical updates, as well as having direct access to original manufacturer's parts to help maintain the instruments in optimal condition. Illumina can engage directly with the engineers that designed the instruments, to help resolve challenging technical support needs. <br />These instruments by virtue of their complex nature containing multiple individual components require regular maintenance as well as alignment and calibrations which can only be carried out by dedicated knowledgeable engineers trained specifically by the manufacturer, Illumina Inc. No other vendor has either access or has to ability to provide these specialized parts. These sequencers are mission critical for the scientific experiments undertaken in the individual laboratories where these devices are maintained in NICHD laboratories. Furthermore, Illumina trains only their engineers on the functions and system control of all these integrated devices. Illumina does not offer this training to anyone outside of their personnel resources. The priority scheduling is very important for the proper upkeep and functionality of these complex sequencers. Thus, timely service is crucial in the functioning of these two sequencers. Acquisition of service contract offering from other entities/third parties providers can lead to substantive problems getting timely service engineer dispatched and can lead to down times on devices. NIH is a research organization where critical experiments require many weeks of tissue culture preparations and also in animal breeding programs, etc. thus such delays will impose a very large financial burden on research laboratories which are hurting for research funds in the first place. Waste of experimental reagents, animals and human resources are the biggest problem in addition to reduction in research productivities. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within twelve days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The factors used to evaluate offers are (1) technical capability to provide all services/consumables, etc. outline above (2) price; and (3) past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.- Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (Oct 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p><br />(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p><br />(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 P.M. MST on December 12, 2016. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Brenda Summers. The E-mail address is Brenda.S.Summers@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p><br />(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Brenda Summers, (303) 497-5588, E-email address is Brenda.S.Summers@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<div>BACKGROUND<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>USAID&rsquo;s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In<br />&nbsp;</div>

<div>4 | P a g e<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</div>
<div>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office&rsquo;s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers&rsquo; compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</div>

OTI&rsquo;s Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>OTI is looking to hire Deputy Team Leaders for multiple regional teams, which will be determined upon hiring.

<div>AAPD 06-10 &ndash; PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</div>
<div>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</div>
<div>(OCTOBER 2006)</div>
<div>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm. Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</div>
<div>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;</div>
<div>Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Deputy Team Leader &ndash; Washington, D.C. (Multiple</div>
<div>Positions)</div>
<div>SOL-OTI-17-000010</div>
<div>14 | P a g e</div>
<div>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</div>
<div>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</div>
<div>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</div>
<div>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</div>
<div>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</div>
<div>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</div>
<div>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by</div>
<div>Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Deputy Team Leader &ndash; Washington, D.C. (Multiple</div>

<div>SOL-OTI-17-000010</div>
<div>15 | P a g e</div>
<div>insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</div>
<div>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</div>
<div>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</div>

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement to have a preventative maintenance contract to guarantee delivery of Liquid Nitrogen and CO2 to Twinbrook I micro tanks and Twinbrook II bulk tanks. It is crucial that the tanks do not run out of LN2, therefore the telemetry dials the company when the tank is &frac14; low. This dependency assures NIAID prompt delivery and no break damage under any circumstances. Delivery of CO2 is provided by a feeder pump. The feeder pump is a specialized truck that has a microbulk fill connection, with a nozzle that feeds the valve located outside the Twinbrook I building in the penthouse. This tank is monitored by a leased telemetry system 24/7. Regular maintenance of both products includes trouble-shooting telemetries when malfunctions occur within a 24 hour period. Emergency responses are provided within 3 hours and early morning delivery which are vitally important in securing labs needs are met. Please see Statement of Work (attached) for further details.</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></span><br /></span><br />Question 1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there currently a plan to hold an industry day around this solicitation?
<p>
<p>Answer 1: No Industry Day will be held for this solicitation.</p>
<p>Question 2: Can I substitute Cisco VTC Endpoints and Infrastructure products that are compatible to existing equipment owned by NAVAIR/NAWCAD?</p>
<p>Answer 2: Yes, if the equipment supplied is interoperable with Polycom and Cisco/Acano product offerings per section 2.3.2 of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Question 3: Our team is wondering if this opportunity is going to be released under Seaport-e?</p>
<p>Answer 3: No, this is not a Seaport-e requirement.</p>
<p>Question 4: Per Attachment 2 DOD Contract Security Classification of Solicitation #N00421-17-R-0010, will the Government consider sponsoring any bidders who do not currently possess the Secret Facility Clearance, but can readily obtain through such sponsorship by the Government?</p>
<p>Answer 4: The Government will sponsor the successful Offeror for the secret facility clearance.</p>
<p>Question 5: For the Technical Proposal Could we use a Sub contractor's certification for any of the Subfactors listed below?</p>
<p>Subfactor 2- Polycom Certification<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span>Subfactor 3- Cisco Certification<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span>Subfactor 4- Crestron Certification<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Answer 5: Yes, however only the certified company will be able to supply the equipment and perform the services related to that brand name.</p>
<p>Question 6: Can you tell what who the incumbent contractor is on this effort (or who has historically provided these products/services)?</p>
<p>Answer 6: The incumbent information is contained in Section L of the RFP.</p>
<p>Question 7: Can you please tell me if the prime 8(a) contractor is not certified in one of the OEMs listed (Volume 2; Technical - Subfactor 2: Polycom; Subfactor 3: Cisco, or Subfactor 4: Crestron) can an OEM certification be used from its subcontract/teaming partner to fulfil this requirement?</p>
<p>Answer 7: Yes, however the prime contractor is still ultimately responsible for overall successful performance of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See also Answer 5.</p>
<p>Question 8: None of the materials listed on ATTACHMENT 1- MATERIALS (Pricing Table) list any Cisco items, so why is being a Cisco authorized re-seller a requirement? Subfactor 3: Cisco Certification. The Offeror must provide proof of being an authorized re-seller of Cisco brand name equipment and services.</p>
<p>Answer 8: Yes, the Offeror must be certified because it supports the statement in the SOW section 1.1.2.2 related to the DoD/DoN Unified Capabilities plan. Cisco can be used as a substitution for the Polycom items for pricing table responses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government is working on an amendment to the solicitation to revise the pricing tables to reflect both Polycom and Cisco equipment options.</p>
<p>Question 9: Can you please identify if AWDs are applicable and if so which SCA Wage Determinations apply?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current data available on Federal Procurement Data System indicates that none of the historic delivery orders were identified as SCA.</p>
<p>Answer 9: This procurement is not Service Contract Act (SCA) procurement; therefore SCA Wage Determinations are not applicable.</p>
<p>*Answers continue to be compiled for the additional question submissions that are not listed above. A revised "Pricing Table" Attachment will be posted at the Government's earliest opportunity to reflect the ability to use Cisco products in place of Polycom products. An extension of the question submission deadline as well as an extension to the RFP response time is currently under consideration. Any changes will be posted at the Government's earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Airborne Connectivity and Dissemination</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-08</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSERTION (CFDA) Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.900</p>
<p>I. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION</span>:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, test, evaluation and experimentation of innovative technologies and techniques for Airborne Network Connectivity and Dissemination.</p>
<p>The objective of the BAA is to conceive, develop and demonstrate innovative and affordable technologies that provide agile and secure information transmission, network and dissemination capabilities to airborne platforms that enable the sharing of quality information within resource and policy constraints. The intent is to expand the Global Information Grid (GIG) to connect three major domains of warfare: Air, Space, and Terrestrial. The goal is to deliver timely, reliable, and actionable information to war-fighters and systems across the United States Air Force enterprise to support Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Efforts under this program are expected to enable the Air Force to provide a transportable network, flexible enough to communicate with any air, space, or ground asset in the area. The network will provide a beyond line-of-sight (LoS) communications infrastructure that can be packed up and moved in and out of the designated battle-space, enabling the military to have a reliable and secure communications network that extends globally. The network is designed to be flexible enough to provide the right communication and network packages for a specific region, mission, or technology.<br />White papers may describe but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a) Hardware brass-boards and/or software systems development. <br />b) Activities for validation with model-based design and simulation.<br />c) Demonstration of hardware brass-boards and antenna in-the-loop validation techniques.</p>
<p>Research efforts under this program are expected to result in functional capabilities, concepts, theory, and applications addressing Air Force airborne network connectivity problems. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.</p>
<p>Work is encouraged in, but not limited to, these focus areas:</p>
<p>1. Airborne Network Architecture</p>
<p>a) Develop network architectures that support self-organizing, self- healing autonomous machine-to- machine data routing and dissemination.</p>
<p>b) Develop self-aware/sentient cross-Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer network communications paradigms that support cooperative learning and reconfiguration-on-the-fly of mobile networks, by sensing and adapting to operational environment and mission requirements.</p>
<p>c) Demonstrate cooperative wireless network communications that allow nodes in a wireless network to share resources and to cooperatively transmit, providing reliable, robust connectivity via multipath routing.</p>
<p>2. Information Transport Performance Management</p>
<p>a) Develop the communications management capabilities to support the management of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) related network and information system and communications resources.</p>
<p>b) Develop information management algorithms capable of dynamically requesting data from multiple ISR sensors in order to enhance current capabilities for detecting, locating, identifying, and tracking ground moving targets.</p>
<p>c) Develop the mechanisms to enable mission-based priority schemes and assured information delivery techniques supporting the exchange of ISR traffic, as well as other network traffic.</p>
<p>d) Develop metrics such as Kill Chain Reduction, Bandwidth Efficiency, or Network Availability to gauge performance and effects.</p>
<p>3. Integration and Interoperability with the Global Information Grid (GIG)</p>
<p>a) Integrate new communications resources available on the ISR platform(s), to enable increased communications capability.</p>
<p>b) Study potential ISR collection planning and envisioned dynamic tasking techniques being developed for current and future Air Operations Centers (AOCs). Develop the information management algorithms to ensure they will operate within the constraints of these envisioned collection management techniques.</p>
<p>c) In conjunction with the Government, work with the operational community to address Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) issues associated with ISR platform interoperability.</p>
<p>d) Conduct airborne flight experiments utilizing multiple ISR assets aimed at demonstrating capabilities for increasing multi-platform interoperability and tracking performance.</p>
<p>4. Advanced Tactical Data Links (ATDL)</p>
<p>Tactical Data Links (TDL) are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as fixed formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free text messaging and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, and digital machine to machine target and threat information sharing, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. In combat TDLs enable engagement of high-value, time-critical targets in anti-access/area-denial environments. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced Tactical Data Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL).</p>
<p>a) Conduct experiments and demonstrations providing validation of critical capabilities and enhancements to the Aerial Layer Network.</p>
<p>b) Conduct experiments demonstrating interoperability among Air Force fighter platforms. Provide validation to ensure the Air Force fighter fleet maintains standardization, to develop interoperable data link exchanges.</p>
<p>c) Conduct RF in-the-loop experiments to demonstrate ATDL validation and model authentication supporting Global Strike (GS), Global Persistent Attack (GPA), Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions.</p>
<p>d) Demonstrate ATDLs on the fighter fleet to expand Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data link connectivity.</p>
<p>e) Model future ATDL concepts for the next-generation conceptual fighter fleet to demonstrate scenario-based mission impact.</p>
<p>ATDL validation activities are encouraged but not required to include the use of AFRL antenna measurement facilities. The AFRL Rome Research Site maintains the largest advanced antenna measurement facilities of its kind in the United States. The facilities support installed antenna measurement on full-scale air-frames and ground vehicles. AFRL has a large inventory of airframes including F-35, all three variants, F-22, F-16, F-15, A-10, and Global Hawk.</p>

<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br />a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />b. FAPISS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />(a) FAR 52.209-07, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />(b) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />(c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation <br />(d) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />(e) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span></strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<DESC>UPDATE 01 DECEMBER 2016: Posting the Questions/Comments from the second Draft RFP, as well as, the Government's responses.<br /><br />UPDATE: 04 NOVEMBER 2016: Posting of DRAFT RFP and notice that the Solicitation Number has been updated to W900KK-17-R-0030.<br /><br />The prupose of this announcement is to disseminate the updated DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Virtual Patient Simulator System (VPSS) Whole Body Patient Simulators (WBPS) with the added Lot IV&nbsp;to industry. The Government kindly request industry to comment or submit questions regarding the DRAFT RFP and applicable attachments no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, Tuesday 15 November 2016.<br /><br />UPDATE: 22 AUGUST 2016: Response date corrected to 2 September 2016.
<p><br />UPDATE: 18 AUGUST 2016: SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN): The Government is currently refining an acquisition strategy for the VPSS WBPS effort and anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with subsequent competitive Delivery/Task Orders for VPSS WBPS requirements, representing the best value to the Government. <br />Joint Project Management Office for Medical Modeling and Simulation (JPMO MMS) is supplementing their initial Market Research to determine interested sources and capabilities of industry for the procurement of WBPS support services. This SSN is a follow up to the DRAFT RFP posted to FBO.gov and will supplement market research efforts and acquisition strategy. This post is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the US Government.</p>
<p>The JPMO MMS intends for the VPSS WBPS Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to procure the required WBPS and all necessary support services/supplies. JPMO MMS may procure the ancillary WBPS support services and/or supplies via a VPSS WBPS MAC Task or Delivery Order without requiring the WBPS system on the same Task or Delivery Order. Delivery Orders for predominately WBPS support items will be procured via Lot I, II, or III, as outlined on the DRAFT RFP previously posted to FBO.gov. However, Task Orders for predominantly WBPS support services will be procured using a separate WBPS Lot. Pending the results of this market research, it is anticipated WBPS Lot IV will be established to procure WBPS support services for Lot I. High Fidelity WBPS, and Lot III, Veterinary WBPS.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a capabilities statement indicating their ability to provide the products and/or services described herein. Responders are advised that the US Government will not reimburse any contractor for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this SSN. The contractor will assume all costs associated with responding to this SSN. Not responding to this SSN does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.</p>
<p>There is no formal solicitation available at this time. No award will be made because of this market survey. If a formal solicitation is generated later, a solicitation notice will be published. All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for VPSS WBPS Lot IV (Support Services) is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: At a minimum, the attached Excel Workbook entitlied, "VPSS WBPS Sources Sought Capabilities Spreadsheet_(Insert Company Name Here)," MUST be used in response to this SSN, indicating what capability is currently available without the need to subcontract, and the recent contract efforts that WBPS Support Service tasks were executed. The VPSS WBPS DRAFT Base SOW has been updated and is posted to this notice (Reference DRAFT SOW posted on 18 AUG). For the purposes of this posting, recent is defined as performance within three years of this SSN posting date. The anticipated WBPS Lot for Support Service will be inclusive of requirements for High Fidelity and Veterinary Patient Simulators; therefore, the attached Excel Sheet combines the inquiry of WBPS Support Service Capability. Please note the Government is NOT inquiring on WBPS Low Fidelity Support Service capability.</p>
<p>For your reference, the Government has attached the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for the base ID/IQ contract. Up to 10 additional Microsoft Word pages may also be submitted to further delineate your firm's capabilities as it relates to the requirements outlined within the Excel sheet. The Government may not review any pages beyond the 10-page limit. The above described capability statements are due to the contacts outlined below, no later than 4:30 PM EST on Friday, September 2, 2016. Company information should include the following:</p>
<p>a) Your company name, address, POC, email addresses, phone numbers and the company's web page (if applicable); <br />b) Company capabilities and experience relative to the VPSS WBPS capabilities identified above and within attached Excel Sheet; <br />c) Identification of business size as it relates to NAICS 541990 ($15M). i.e. US large or small business, service disabled veteran business, HUB Zone, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman Owned SB, etc.; and<br />d) Statement of whether or not your firm intends to propose as a prime contractor/team member/subcontractor.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. This is not a solicitation and is issued solely for information, planning purposes and market research only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP. This Request for Information (RFI) does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is not at this time seeking proposals.

This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the level of availability in the current market. The DEA is interested in obtaining information from contractors that can meet the requirements in the SOW. Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist the DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

For each contract listed include the type of contract; total estimated value; contract period of performance (e.g., base and number of option periods); customer (i.e., federal agency) and respective point of contact (e.g., point of contact’s name, phone number, and email address). The Government encourages creativity and innovation in responses to the RFI.

Any questions about this RFI should be submitted in writing to Morgan Hairston no later than November 22, 2016, 12:00 p.m. local Eastern Standard Time. Answers to general questions will be provided under an amendment to the RFI and posted to FBO. Answers to vendor specific questions will be provided directly to the vendor. Interested parties are requested to submit a white paper, inclusive of Section I and Section II, via email directly to Morgan.R.Hairston@usdoj.gov no later than December 16, 2016, 12:00 p.m. local Eastern Standard Time. Any responses received after the closing date and time will not be considered. No literature will be returned to responding sources and each source is solely responsible for all expenses associated with submitting their literature. All information will be kept confidential and will not be disseminated to the public.

- This is a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP);

I.  INTRODUCTION/ BACKGROUND
AMSIS is an aerospace medical information system that integrates critical medical information associated with airmen, air traffic controllers and other aviation-related personnel in safety sensitive roles that require medical certification and clearance. These personnel are from geographically distributed locations both nationally and internationally. AMSIS provides tools necessary for the AAM to make risk-based decisions through an automated method of collecting, reviewing, and analyzing medical information.

2.  Description of the Required Services
Navigation Technical Assistance Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet the needs of the 21st Century.  Inherent in this mission is the requirement to provide a safe, cost-effective, navigation and timing service. Currently, navigation requirements are largely met with legacy, ground-based navigation, and lighting systems.  FAA has committed to evolving the NAS to Performance Based Navigation (AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP).  During this lengthy transition, FAA has a requirement to support both legacy and modernized navigation systems.  

Through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), FAA is addressing the impact of air traffic growth by increasing capacity and efficiency while improving safety, reducing environmental impacts, and increasing user access to the National Airspace System (NAS).  AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP is an essential element of the NextGen plan to modernize the NAS.  To achieve NextGen goals, FAA is implementing new AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP routes and procedures that leverage emerging space-based technologies and enhanced aircraft navigation capabilities.  

The NAVTAC II support Contractor will assist the Navigation Programs Group and Performance Based Navigation Offices in their joint mission to provide safe, cost-effective position, navigation, and timing services to meet the operational needs of current and future aviation customers that operate in the NAS.   The FAA Navigation Programs Group and the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Office have a need for professional services covering areas such as engineering support, logistics, software integration and maintenance, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, and business and material management. Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing, and lighting systems, as well as support for the AIR SPACE SERVICES GROUP Instrument Flight Procedure (IFP) process. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  Enclosed is Amendment 2 to SIR DTFAWA-16-R-00024.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />HM157517R0001<br />National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency<br />Construction Site Security Services<br />1.0 Description<br />1.1 The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in support of Construction of the New St. Louis Facility is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide construction site security services.<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NGA is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br />2.0 Background<br />N2W Requirement: The N2W facility is required to replace mission critical facilities in St. Louis that have exceeded their service life. The project will accommodate new technologies and processes that will generate beneficial synergies through integration, collaboration, and geospatial data immersion. The &lsquo;purpose-built' facility will provide an open flexible work environment that is scalable, reconfigurable, and adaptive to changing mission requirements and the associated changes in workflow and data sharing methodologies. The project will provide NGA's workforce with safe, secure, and efficient facilities that will meet the agency's long-term requirements and vision for Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) and will be consistent with the Director National Intelligence (DNI) facilities strategic plan. Given the scale of the construction project and the need for NGA to move from existing facilities minimizing dual operating costs, the N2W will require the builder to provide transition phase services from immediately after beneficial occupancy date (BOD) for up to 24 months later when the facility will be ready for full operational capability (FOC).<br />2.1 Delivery Period: Estimated to be five years, only during the construction phase of this project.<br />2.2 Considerations:<br />2.2.1. Official start date for this project is currently TBD<br />2.2.2. The site is located in an urban environment.<br />2.2.3. Design of the future building, floors and shape, is TBD.<br />2.2.4. Estimated square forage of the building is 800,000<br />2.2.5. The site property comprises 99 acres. <br />2.3 Security Requirements: <br />2.3.1. The completed N2W shall result in a secure facility constructed in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705. Some key design personnel on the design-build team shall be required to have various levels of active security clearances.<br />2.3.2. All Offerors and subcontractors shall be required to comply with DFARS 252.225-7050, Disclosure of ownership or control by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism, DFARS 252.209-7002, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by a Foreign Government and DFARS 252.209-7004, Subcontracting with firms that are owned or controlled by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism.<br />2.3.3. Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTs) shall have a Top Secret Clearance (TS) to begin. CST's shall also have the ability to achieve TS-Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance to accommodate phases of this construction project.<br />2.3.4. Personnel required for duties other than CST, shall be properly accredited and cleared with the proper security clearance up to TS-SCI when required according to the phased construction. The level of security clearance will depend on the progress of the building construction along with accreditation and approval of classification spaces. The proper clearance level will ensure contractors are able to enter spaces required to do their job as the progression of the building is enclosed and classified. <br />2.3.5. Security of the construction site, inspecting vehicles of all types entering the construction site, inspecting construction materials entering the site as well as monitoring the point of manufacture (ie: concrete plant) and personnel entering the site shall carry a high importance. <br />3.0 Requested Information<br />3.1 Performance Work Statement Feedback and Recommendations: Respondents are requested to review the attached PWS and provide recommendations on content and approach to include methods of performance, delivery, workload estimating and deliverables.<br />3.2 Capabilities on Required Services: Respondents are requested to submit a detailed description of their capabilities to provide all or a portion of the services outlined in the PWS. This shall include relevant experience, in house capabilities and small business subcontracting opportunities and partnerships.<br />3.3 Personnel Recruitment, Retention, and Timing: Respondents are requested to submit a capabilities statement that shows how trained and cleared personnel will be provided to meet all security requirements throughout the five year construction process, to include lead time for onsite personnel. This shall include the ability to staff Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTs) as required and to staff and bring cleared, trained personnel onsite. Describe the methodology to staff TS CSTs in the St. Louis, MO area.<br />3.4 Additional requested information<br />4.0 Responses<br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.<br />4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word or PDF format are due no later than December 20, 2016. Responses shall be limited to 50 pages, single spaced, size 12 font, including attachments and submitted via e-mail to jeffrey.h.teague@nga.mil. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. In the course of this RFI, NGA may share some or all of the information obtained, marked proprietary or otherwise, with support contractor employees. Each of these "contractor employees" has signed a non-disclosure agreement with NGA. If this is not acceptable, please annotate this on your cover letter. <br />4.3. Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:<br />4.3.1. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.<br />4.3.2.

A statement that the respondent will or will not allow the Government to release its proprietary data, if any, to the Government support contractors. <br />4.3.4. Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUB Zone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561612, "Security Guards and Patrol Services".

A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $20.5 M million dollars in annual receipts. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Respondents are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards. The FAR is available at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ <br />4.3.5 The facility security clearance cage code of the respondent.<br />5.0 Industry Discussions<br />NGA representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.<br />6.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Jeffrey Teague at jeffrey.h.teague@nga.mil no later than December 5, 2016. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.

The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The NGA has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed to be a commitment or an authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.

<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PREVIOUSLY POSTED UNDER KADENA MACC FA5270-16-R-0007</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>The 18th Contracting Squadron is seeking industry information and input with regards to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program including Kadena Air Base, Naval Facilities Engineering Command&nbsp; (NAVFAC), and partnering units on Okinawa, Japan and surrounding areas (to include the country of Japan in its entirety).</p>
<p>NOTICE:<br />&nbsp;<br />This synopsis is not to be construed as a solicitation. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. The purpose of this synopsis is to make responsible sources aware of an upcoming requirement. A solicitation is expected to be released on or about 21 November 2016. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DETAILS:<br />&nbsp;<br />The MACC program is defined as an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract entered into with two or more sources pursuant to the same solicitation. The envisioned MACC program is a firm-fixed price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that provides a vehicle for the execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build (ranging from 35% up to 100% level of effort), renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is required. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for work performed will be NAICS Code No. 238990. During the life of the contract, projects will be identified as task orders and will be competed amongst those successful contractor(s) who receive a basic contract under the MACC.<br />Individual task orders are anticipated to range between $500K - $30M / (&yen;) Yen equivalent. The total program value will not exceed $980M / (&yen;) Yen equivalent over a seven-year period. The Government anticipates awarding a minimum of five (5) contracts; however, it reserves the right to award less than or more than five contracts depending on the competition. Each contract awarded will contain an initial ordering period of five years and may extend the contract period for one or more successive periods, not to exceed seven years total, pursuant to a modification of the contract. Performance bonds will be required per individual task order in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 28.</p>
<p>NOTE: This MACC program will be performed in its entirety in the country of Japan. The successful offeror must be licensed and registered to perform work in the country of Japan.</p>
<p>The Government is not taking questions at this time. All prospective offerors will have an opportunity to ask any questions once the solicitiation has been posted. All interested parties must be currently registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (http://www.sam.gov/) in order to be considered for award.</p>

<DESC>The following questions about the solicitation were submitted and have been addressed below. Numbering is continued from the first set of questions.<br /><br />---An amendment (SF-30) to the solicitation is also issued and attached in response to the questions. For a proposal to be responsive, signed copies of all SF-30's must be submitted with the proposal.---<br /><br />Question 4:<br />Drawing Sheet No. S-500, upper left corner of drawing in the BILL OF MATERIALS, Item No. 5 Crosby No. MN G-414, # 1038004 SS thimble. I cannot find this in any of Crosby's literature, is this a good OR bad part number? I believe that the Part No. is supposed to be a Crosby SS-414. Is this correct?
<p>Answer 4: <br />Drawing Sheet No. S-500 has been revised with the revised thimble call out and is attached to this notice. It replaces the original and all previous versions of Drawing Sheet No. S-500 in Attachment A - Drawing Packet.</p>
<p>Question 5:<br />From Drawing Sheet No's. G-100, PLAN VIEW - FULL ARRAY and Drawing Sheet G-101 EXISTING PLAN VIEW - WASHINGTON SHORE. Both of these drawings are misleading to any viewer, because neither drawing is showing the downstream lower NAVLOCK guide wall and how the three (3) North carrier line support towers [N1, N2 and N3] relate to their positions. Also from what information that there is, I believe that they are not in a straight line.</p>
<p>Answer 5: <br />The plan views, G-100 and G-101 were both obtained in the archives from the original installation. Their primary purpose is to reference lines requiring replacement for this contract, with respect to the whole array and other lines along the section. Towers N1, N2 and N3 are not in a straight line. For detailed tower arrangement and locations. See Appendix E, Drawing Packet 29026-001.</p>
<p>Question 6:<br />I've been told from sources other than what that USACE's has put out about this solicitation that the original installation of these Avian Array ropes were with Cortland 3/16" Spectra ropes. Is this correct?<br />Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Question 7:<br />From Drawing No. S-500 upper left hand corner, Item No. 1 says to use 3/8" 7 x 19 GALV CABLE in the Part Number column and under the Description column it says GALVANIZED STEEL CABLE, however in looking at Crosby's specification sheet the use of 7 x 19 cable is not recommended by Crosby to be used with the Item No. 3 (Crosby No. 1054029), S-501 Open Swage Socket.<br /><br />Answer 7: Drawing Sheet No. S-500 has been revised with the revised rope call out and is attached to this notice. It replaces the original and all previous versions of Drawing Sheet No. S-500 in Attachment A - Drawing Packet.</p>
<p>Question 8:<br />Can you please provide us with the site visit attendee list from the November 17 site visit?</p>
<p>Answer 8: <br />Site Visit Attendees recorded on the Site Visit Attendee log for W9127N-17-R-0007 Avian Array Rope Replacement 17 November 2016 Site Visit Attendee List:</p>

<DESC><p>This is a modification to the pre-solicitation notice posted on 1 December 2016.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE: 6 JANUARY 2017, 12:00 PM CST</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare housekeeping and related services in support of multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the health service area (HSA) of Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center (DDEAMC), Fort Gordon, GA. This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type I, II, III, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on an MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award. The resultant FFO task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe DDEAMC MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be FFP and subject to the Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. 351). The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line item numbers (CLINs) with 5-year ordering periods. The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for the post award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against fiscal year (FY) 17 funds. Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the FY in which the order is placed.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) Dental and Craniofacial Trauma Research and Tissue Regeneration Directorate has a need for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) services using latest deep-sequencing, high-throughput, HiSeq NGS technology for whole-genome shotgun sequencing (metagenome) and RNA-sequencing (metatranscriptome) of viral, fungal and bacterial communities residing in the microbiome of major classes of chronic wounds. Prior expertise and proficiency is required to utilize the proper library prep and NGS sequencing chemistry (e.g., low-input versus high-input) for each task to generate high-quality sequenced reads with sufficient sequenced read length and coverage for statistically sound downstream computational analysis. A proficient bioinformatics group that provides expertise in assembly, annotation, and analysis of fungal, viral, and bacterial sequences is needed for the timely completion of downstream computational analyses for the different tasks described below.

<DESC>Derived Credentials Solution
Items of Clarification ahead of Vendor Day

The VA received numerous responses from our previous RFI regarding Derived Credentials.  We would like to make sure to clarify a few additional items ahead of our Vendor Day.

At this time the VA will not be migrating its existing EMM solution away from AirWatch. Any such responses will not be considered, as any migration of EMM vendors is currently out of scope for this project. All discussions around Derived Credentials must be able to integrate with the AirWatch EMM solution which the VA has deployed on-premise.  

The solution architecture must be able to be stood up in a FEDRAMP High cloud.  The cloud itself must have already received its authorization.  The authorization for this CSP to meet all of the requirements of FEDRAMP High cannot be in progress for any proposed solution. 

The proposed solution must integrate with the VA s current CMS.  We understand that newer products exist with the ability to replace the existing CMS, but at this time the VA will not be migrating to a new CMS. To start the VA will be piloting this solution alongside of our existing portfolio of IAM and EMM products. 

The VA will be taking a phased approach to the derived credentials solution, and must be able to pilot it out in our current environment integrating with the solutions the VA has already deployed to ensure the solution is viable for full scale deployment.

Justification and Approval

Justification 

 For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 6  (NCO 6) Hampton, VA on behalf of the Fayetteville VA Medical Center (FVAMC)  Fayetteville, NC, justification for other than full and open competition for Emergency Room Physician staffing and Management of the Fayetteville VA Medical Center Urgent Care Clinic.
 
Description of Action:
This request is for an emergency sole source contract with the incumbent contractor, Emergency Medical Associates (EMA), for the staffing and operation of the Fayetteville VA Medical Center (FVAMC) Urgent Care Clinic (UCC).  A competitive contract was awarded to EMA that was protested due to what the protestor felt was an improper evaluation.  OGC informed GAO that the VA would take corrective action in accordance with VA Procurement Policy Memorandum (2016-05) and the protest was dismissed as academic by GAO due to the corrective action that would be taken, which was to cancel the award, do additional market research and make a new award determination.  Given that there is not enough time to accomplish the corrective action before the current contract expires on November 30, 2016, it is the best interest of the Government to immediately continue services with EMA via an emergency sole source contract for 60 days.

Description of Supplies or Services :
The request is for the staffing and operation of the FVAMC UCC.  The period of performance will be December 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.

The total estimated price of the proposed action is: $713,640.00 

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

(x) FAR 6.302-2 (a) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency: VA s need for the staffing and operation of the UCC is so urgent that Veterans would be seriously impacted unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals.
 
Rationale supporting Use of Authority cited Above:
The current contract ends on November 30, 2016 and there is not enough time to complete the corrective action recommended by GAO.  The services must continue uninterrupted in order to ensure Veterans are able to receive Urgent Care Services. The current incumbent contractor is the only firm in the position to ensure there are no interruptions in service as they have a cadre of 50 physicians that have been rotating through the FVAMC that already have completed background checks and are credentialed.

Efforts to obtain Competition:
The CO requested an offer from only one source, that being EMA, the incumbent, as that is the most practicable approach due to the very small window of time before the current contract expires on November 30, 2016.  

Actions to increase Competition:
The corrective action recommended by GAO will be addressed during the 60 day sole source. 
 
Market Research:
The current incumbent contractor is the only firm that can successfully ensure that services are not interrupted due to their large pool of 50 providers who are mostly local and who already have completed background investigations and are credentialed at the FVAMC. No other firm has the qualifications to begin performance on December 1, 2016.

Other Facts:
There are no other facts that have not already been provided.

Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Determination that Anticipated Cost is fair and Reasonable:  A determination has been made by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable as the pricing is based on current contract prices which were determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of award.

Contracting Officer's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
