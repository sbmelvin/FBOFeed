<DESC><p>The 325th Contracting Office announces the issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory. This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement. Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a white paper (step one). Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a full proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting contractor will be awarded a contract. The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. The complete BAA including proposal preparation information and BAA Guide for Industry are attached.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement. No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired. Potential Offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, potential offerors must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database under NAICS 541712.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>DLA Information Operations at New Cumberland, PA located at Susquehanna, PA has a requirement for a Contractor to provide daily Information Assurance (IA) operational support, policy, and strategic planning for DLA Distribution, which currently encompasses the DLA Distribution Headquarters (HQ), twenty-six (26) distribution centers, satellite activities, and eleven (11) mapping activities. The period of performance is from 04 December 2011 through 03 April 2012. The solicitation number for this procurement is SP3300-12-Q-5002. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541513; the Business Size Standard is $25,000,000<br />The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution New Cumberland, PA intends to directly solicit and negotiate with one source; under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) and "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
<p>The Government intends to award a Firm fixed price purchase order using FAR Part 13 to Veris Group, LLC. Veris Group LLC. has been providing these services for almost two years. Veris Group LLC. has the required skills, training, security, and certifications that are required to perform all requirements listed in the PWS. They have the hands-on knowledge required to continue these services effectively for the short term bridge contract.</p>
<p>The current requirement has a "secret" clearance requirement. The cost and time to perform the required background investigation would outweigh the value of any potential competed award for a 120 day period of performance. Once a facility obtains a "Secret" clearance, then contractor can submit a request for investigation. The background investigation for a "Secret" clearance can take a year or more to complete. The benefit to the Government and even to a contractor for a four month period of performance is impractical and the Government bears the investigation costs and these costs should be part of any evaluation cost. The problem with including the costs is that each investigation is unique and has different costs depending upon the complexity of the investigations. <br />Interested sources may respond by submitting their company's qualifications/capabilities by 03 November 2011, 11:00 AM EST to Contract Specialist Patrick Van Sant via email Patrick.vansant@dla.mil Phone call requests will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research that focuses on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts. This includes support for clinical research programs and individual research projects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents. Increasingly, bioinformatics support for scientific data management and analysis is becoming an essential component of immunological research. Examples of this support include approaches to integrate disparate data sets and data types; development and dissemination of novel analytical tools in domain specific areas and across clinical and laboratory data; resources for centralization and analysis of data that allow the immunology community broad access to and facilitate secondary analyses of existing data; support for community evaluation of analytical tools and methods; continued development of and adherence to standards for data collection, storage and exchange; and training in the use of analytical tools. In an effort to address the bioinformatics needs across the DAIT-supported immunology research community, the NIAID plans to recompete the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dait/pages/bisc.aspx).</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete for contract services to continue to provide critical bioinformatics support to DAIT-funded immunology research through the continuation and refinement of ImmPort, and continued development of optimal methods for data collection, storage, exchange, and interoperability; development and implementation of novel data integration and retrieval methods; enhancement of capabilities for clinical data access and support, provision of technical user support; and optimization of user value through provision of multiple workspace levels and analytic tools.</p>
<p>The NIAID will provide the hardware and networking architecture to support production, pilot, and quality assurance environments. In the event that it is deemed necessary by the Government for the contract to provide these hosting environments, the contract to be awarded includes options to provide information technology infrastructure for the production, pilot, and quality assurance environments.</p>
<p>In addition, the contract to be awarded includes options to: extend the base period of performance; increase the level of effort; provide for a final transition; develop novel analyses tools; and provide information technology infrastructure for production, pilot, and quality assurance environments.</p>
<p>The BISC provides bioinformatics support to the following DAIT-funded networks and research consortia (participating centers): In the future additional networks and/or consortia may be added or current networks and/or consortia removed to reflect changing research priorities of the Institute.</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance Network <br />&bull; Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) <br />&bull; Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT) <br />&bull; Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children (CTOT-C) <br />&bull; Population Genetics Analysis Program <br />&bull; Protective Immunity for Special Populations <br />&bull; HLA Region Genomics in Immune-mediated Diseases <br />&bull; Maintenance of Macaque Specific Pathogen-Free Breeding Colonies <br />&bull; Modeling Immunity for Biodefense <br />&bull; Reagent Development for Toll-like and other Innate Immune Receptors <br />&bull; Adjuvant Development Program <br />&bull; Innate Immune Receptors and Adjuvant Discovery Program <br />&bull; Human Immunology Project Consortium<br />&bull; Non-human Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group</p>
<p>More information about these programs and networks can be found at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dait/pages/programsnetworks.aspx.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>CRITERIA WEIGHT</p>
<p>1: Technical plan/approach 100<br />2: Scientific and Technical Personnel 40<br />3: Project Management 30<br />4: Facilities, Equipment, Other Resources, <br />and Security 10<br />5: OPTIONS 40</p>
<p>TOTAL POSSIBLE WEIGHT: 220</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one level of effort type contract will be awarded for a one (1) year period of performance beginning on or about 9/30/2012. The Government may exercise an option for an additional year of performance up to four (4) times during the life of the contract. The total period of performance resulting from the base period plus all potential exercising of this option is five (5) years. The services required will be the same scope provided during the base year. The anticipated contract award will also contain an option for an increased level of effort by 208 direct labor hours over the base period, which can be exercised multiple times within the base period and within each contract year up to a maximum of 2,080 total direct labor hours (1 FTE) per year.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: 14 FTEs for the Base Period.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to complete a Technical/Visual Upgrade for one AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 located at MCAS, Camp Pendleton, CA.  In addition, there is an option to complete another Technical/Visual Upgrade for one AH-1 WST device 2F136A-1 at MCAS New River, NC.  All of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) in the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be options except for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 and the corresponding Technical Data and Information CLIN.  All of the CLINS in the RFP will be Firm Fixed Price.  Each AH-1 WST device will have CLINS for Provisioned Item Orders, an Initial Operational Assessment Period (IOAP), After Action Review (AAR) Software Replacement, Air Conditioning, and Advanced Simulation Technology Incorporated (ASTI) upgrades.
  The primary purpose of these trainer modifications is to increase training system supportability and reduce total life cycle support costs.
The AH-1 WST supports the AH-1W Warfighter Program, the Fleet Readiness Squadron (FRS) HMLAT-303 and the Marine Aviation Training System Site (MATSS) at Camp Pendleton, CA to meet AH-1W pilot throughput requirements.  Once upgraded, the AH-1 WST will be technically capable of continuing to accomplish Training & Readiness (T&R) Syllabus events designated to be completed in a simulator.  HMLAT-303 has a requirement to train AH-1W pilots through the end of the projected aircraft service life in FY20.  The estimated delivery date for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 upgrade is 21 months after contract award.
  In addition, the estimated delivery date for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-1 is 21 months after the exercise of option.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.<br><br>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP web site at;<br><br>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions <br><br>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP web site no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, January 5, 2012. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <br><br>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.<br><br>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.  <br><br>Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.<br><br>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.<br><br>The point of contact for procedural questions in the SERDP Office is Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 703-696-2127.

<p>Engineering Services and Fifth Wheel Assembly &amp; Manufacturing</p>
<p>NAICS: 541330 Engineering Services<br />336211 Fifth Wheel Assemblies Manufacturing <br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, AFNWC/PKMA 6014 Dogwood Ave (Bldg 1258, rm 25), Hill AFB, UT, 84056-5825.</p>
<p>Special Considerations:</p>
<p>Contract award decision may be based upon an evaluation of cost and non-cost factors (i.e., technical capability, past performance, etc.).</p>
<p>TERP OVERVIEW:</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (AFNWCI) System Program Office (SPO) Minuteman III (MMIII) Mechanical Ground Systems Branch is considering competition of a contract to replace the Transporter Erector (TE). The TE is the sole vehicle used for transporting, emplacing and removing the MM III booster at the various remote launch facilities. The currently fielded TE was the replacement to the original TE that was fielded in 1957 with the original Minuteman I system and was fielded in 1988. The war fighter (Air Force Global Strike Command) requires an obsolescent free replacement for the TE that will sustain booster handling operations through 2030. <br />The changing nuclear security environment has placed an exceptional burden on the TE design, fleet wide. MMIII booster maintenance and replacement programs are expected to continue which will cause the TE usage rates to increase over the intended service life. The acquisition of the TE replacement will be completed in two phases:<br />Phase 1 (Engineering Manufacturing and Development) : Contractor responsibilities will include tasks associated with engineering and program management such that modifications or changes to Government Furnished specifications, drawings, Technical Orders and manuals will not negatively impact TE performance parameters. The estimated number of drawings and specifications that will need to be updated is ~ 450 documents. Parameters to be measured will reflect the adequacy of system level readiness and will include agreed upon measures of "Reliability", "Delivery", "Producability", and "Sustainability". Two "First Article" TEs will be fabricated to updated specifications. The "First Articles" will be used in agreed upon qualification testing of the TE. Upon completion of qualification testing and report, contractor will deliver full updated data package with applicable data rights.<br />Phase 2 (Production): Contractor responsibilities will include tasks associated with engineering support, program management and fabrication of 22 TEs by the end of FY18. Government will furnish complete data package and effort will be "build to print". Parameter to be measured will reflect the adequacy of system level readiness and will include an agreed upon measure of "Delivery. Options to accelerate production to as many as 10 TEs per calendar year are desired. Additionally, an option to produce 5 additional TEs is desired.</p>
<p>The AFNWCI SPO Mechanical Ground Systems Branch is seeking industry interest in phase 1 or the combination of phase 1 and phase 2 at this time. Please indicate your interest by answering the following questions as they relate to your organization, not including what is currently subcontracted. Responses should be kept to the approximate length identified in the parenthesis after each question using Times New Roman 12-point font with a one inch top, bottom, and edge margins. Response should be approximately 16 pages total.</p>
<p>AFNWCI SPO will host an Industry Day on 22 Sep 11 from 0900 to 1400 where interested parties may come to Hill AFB, UT to see a current TE and ask questions related to the effort being sought in this RFI. The government will not reimburse any expense associated with attending this event.

<RESPDATE>120511
<CONTACT>Bruce James Richeson, Phone 8017775535, Email bruce.richeson@hill.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information<br />Title: MMIII Mk21 AFA Component Refurbishment and Repair<br />27 Oct 11<br />Mk21 AFA Component Refurbishment/Repair Overview:<br />The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Systems Reentry Systems/Reentry Vehicles Section (AFNWC/NWIBC), Hill AFB, Utah must prepare a sustainment concept to provide two years of refurbishment and repairs for the Mk21 Arming and Fuzing Assembly (AFA) components: the Solid State Radar (SSR), the Launch Safety Device (LSD) and the Programmer Timer Processor (PTP). This activity replaces the SSR Refurbishment contract that ends 30 September 2012; the LSD Conversion contract that ends 30 Dec 2011; and the PTP Repair Pathfinder task on ICBM Prime Integration Contract (IPIC) that ends 30 Dec 2011. The Mk21 AFA Component Refurbishment/Repair acquisition has one key objective:
<p>- Provide refurbished/repaired Mk21 SSRs, LSDs, and PTPs to feed the supply pipeline for the Mk21 AFA Refurbishment for a two-year period<br />This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research to identify sources that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. <br />This RFI is specific to the Mk21 Arming and Fuzing Assembly (AFA) Solid State Radar (SSR), Launch Safety Device (LSD), and the Programmer Timer Processor (PTP). Work includes addressing known issues with the SSR including 100% replacement of the thermal battery, bus-wire &amp; thermal grease, and tuning of the SSR to optimize power output; addressing degradation of certain internal gear parts/assemblies on the LSD including changing the size and material of two pinion gears and replacement of the gear rack; replacement of the C7/C28 capacitor stack on the PTP A3 Printed Wiring Boards (PWB), replacement of the C42 capacitors on the A5 PWB and acceleration testing of the Force-Balance Accelerometer Transducer (FBAT); and repair of failed components down to the circuit card level.</p>
<p>System unique Test Equipment (TE) required for component certification, troubleshooting, and repair includes: Low Frequency Instrumentation Console (LFIC), Radio Frequency Instrumentation Console (RFIC), DITMCO, Test Console System (TCS), centrifuges, individual component Interface Adapter Units (IAU), and the Teradyne. Spare MK21 component TE is not known to exist. All Government owned SSR, PTP, and LSD TE is currently being used to support existing component repair/refurbishment programs and cannot be provided as Government Furnished Equipment to support this repair effort. Most of this TE is weapon system unique using primarily 1980/90 technology and may have significant lead time to redesign for new build or acquire parts for repair if system components cannot be acquired due to equipment failure.</p>
<p>Technical data specific to the current repair facilities does exist but would have to be tailored/modified to each contractor's unique processes, facility, and environment. Some detailed floor level/working level documentation is contractor proprietary and would not be provided to support this effort. <br />The contractor awarded this contract will be required to begin deliveries of the refurbished/repaired components not later than 30 Sep 13.</p>
<p><br />RFI Questions:</p>
<p>The following list of questions should be answered as it relates to your organization, not including what is currently subcontracted.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein. <br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 207 each "C-5 Servo Valve, Hydraulic" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the C-5. The C-5 Servo Valve, is considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the antiskid brake control system. Antiskid brake systems are designed to reduce brake lock-up, resulting in skidding of the tire, while at the same time allowing the maximum brake capability to be applied in order to optimally to stop the aircraft. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the servo valve it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. For this reason, it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Crane Aerospace's own expense. Since the data required to manufacture the C-5 Servo Valve, the next higher assembly, and the brake control manifold are limited to <strong>Crane Aerospace</strong>, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the servo valve and test/prove functionality of the servo valve when assembled on the brake control manifold assembly at their own expense. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.
<p>NSN: 4810-00-441-4468<br />Part Number: 39-163170<br />Noun: Servo Valve, Hydraulic<br />System: C-5<br />Quantity: 207 <br />PR: Multiple Purchase Requests as Required</p>

<p><strong>2. Background/Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force (AF) Air Mobility Command's (AMC) priority is to develop a comprehensive fitness model with a component designed to increase proactive coping, self-management and leadership skills to enhance individual resilience. Cultivating these skills in our Airmen will ensure that AMC maintain a cadre of balanced, healthy, self-confident Airmen whose physical, mental, spiritual and social fitness and resiliency enable them to effectively manage, and even experience personal and professional growth in response to stressors associated with military service, including a high operational tempo, deployments, recurrent change and the requirement to maintain high personal and professional standards of conduct. Military members face all of these challenges in addition to family, home and community responsibilities and stressors, which may be exacerbated by the rigors of military life. The current effort is intended to support and train individual Airmen in small groups to increase resilience across Air Mobility Command. Goals include:</p>
<p>- Supporting positive coping with challenge and adversity<br />- Reducing negative outcomes <br />- Accomplishing the Air Force global mission</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the Aluminum Powder, MIL-DTL-512C Type 3 Grade F Class 7. Aluminum powder is primarily used in main charge explosives to produce a high explosive quality. It is used in many munitions that support combat requirements. For this procurement, the Aluminum powder will be used in Comp HBX Type H6 explosive used in the 40 lb. Cratering Charge. Adding aluminum powder to TNT based explosives creates much additional heat during the detonation, which causes greater expansion of gases and consequently greater blast effect. It is critical to combat effectiveness. Aluminum powder requires several specialized skills and processes that exist commercially. Commercial producers have a highly-trained, experienced workforce with critically required specialized skills and facilities to produce granulized varieties. The specialized processes and facilities include melting the aluminum, adding the proper alloy(s), shooting the aluminum alloy through a nozzle into an inert medium to obtain the desired particle/granule size, and passivating the powder in environmentally controlled silos to allow safe handling. The Aluminum powder must meet the composition, density, form, particle size and all other requirements defined in MIL-DTL-512.  If a solicitation is issued the government will utilize a Best Value, range bid approach, and the resulting contract could be a one year with potential options for a total estimated quantity of 65,250 lbs.  Potential bidders should be aware that all quality requirements must be satisfactorily completed prior to initial production.  Interested parties may request a copy of the full specification via email to benjamin.c.riessen.civ@mail.mil  Request must include your cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, and point of contact. A respondent to this sources sought survey must have available facilities, equipment, skills and personnel to provide the Aluminum Powder. Only SERIOUSLY INTERESTED firms whom feel they are capable of supplying the aluminum powder are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description and summary of the producers capabilities, including a brief description of their organization, name/address/point of contact, facilities/equipment, personnel, inspection capabilities, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria, and minimum and maximum monthly production rates of past production of same or similar items. Information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: U.S. Army Contracting Command- Rock Island, ATTN:CCRC-AR/Benjamin Riessen, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Il 61299-6500, email benjamin.c.riessen.civ@mail.mil, and identify Aluminum Powder sources sought survey as the subject of your response. This sources sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this synopsis.  Responses to this Sources Sought should be forwarded to the POC NLT 25 November 2011.

<DESC>Market Survey for a Pioneer Land Clearing and Bridge Erection Tool Kit<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br><br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."<br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.

<DESC>M734A1 and M783 Market Survey

The Army Contracting Command (ACC), New Jersey (NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources to produce the M734A1 Multi-Option Fuze for Mortars (MOFM) and M783 Point Detonating/Delay Mortar fuze, to support FY13-19 production quantities. The M734A1 fuze has four selectable functions: two proximity Height of Burst settings (60/81 PRX and 120 PRX), Impact (IMP) and Delay (DLY).  No tools are required to set the fuze.  The M734A1 and the M783 fuzes can be used on 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm High Explosive (HE) and 60mm and 120mm White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Rounds.  The M783 fuze has Impact and Delay capability and shares many of the same components with the M734A1 MOFM. It is anticipated that both fuzes will be procured under one contract. The U.S. Government anticipates soliciting for offerors located within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for a single award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract including a basic award of five (5) ordering periods and an option for two (2) additional ordering periods.  The estimated quantity to be purchased over the seven (7) year period is 172,000 for the M783 and the estimated quantity to be purchased over the seven (7) year period for the M734A1 is 73,000. The M734A1 and M783 fuzes shall be manufactured to Government owned Technical Data Packages, drawings, and specifications, which are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to Department of Defense components and their contractors). This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.

<a href="mailto:michael.pasciuto@nasa.gov">Mr. Michael  Pasciuto</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) currently sponsors a number of flightmissions, divided between missions in development and missions in operations. One ofSMDs programmatic objectives is to maximize the science return for the Nation within theavailable budget. One method of doing this is to space flight validate key newtechnologies to reduce their risk to future science missions. This Request forInformation (RFI) solicits information for specific classes of missions to validate keyEarth science technologies. Responses to this RFI will be used to inform NASAs programplanning.Background:The Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) manages technology development for the EarthScience Division at NASA Headquarters. Information on the ESTO program can be found athttp://esto.nasa.gov/	   . There has been and continues to be a need for some new technologies to be validated inspace prior to use in a science mission. This is necessary because the space environmentimposes stringent conditions on components and systems, some of which cannot be fullytested on the ground or in airborne systems.  This RFI specifically excludes ground orairborne validation.  Infusion of new technologies into missions may depend on the riskreduction provided through space flight validation. In addition, some sciencemeasurements can only be fully validated through a demonstration in space. ESTO is mostinterested in science instrument and information system technologies.ESTO is funding several CubeSat-based technology validations as part of a pathfinderprocess. ESTO is now interested in defining the parameters of a possible futurecompetitive program to space validate selected Earth science technologies. That futureprogram is the focus of this RFI. The program may consist of one or two parts. The firstpart would be a continuation of the current CubeSat-based validations or validation usingsuborbital reusable launch vehicles (sRLV). The second part would be a somewhat morerobust program, expanding the class of possible technologies to validate. NASA is issuingthis RFI to seek the high-level details of various projects which might fit in either oneor the other of these classes. Class 1 (CubeSat or sRLV) validations are limited to abudget of less than $5 million and a schedule of 3 years or less. Class 2 validations arelimited to a budget of less than $20 million and a schedule of 5 years or less. In bothcases the schedule limit includes the time required for the actual in-space validation ofthe target technology.Definition: "CubeSat" refers to a type of nanosatellite, the dimensions of which areabout 10x10x11 centimeters each (i.e., a "Cube" or a "1U"). CubeSats typically range from1U to 6U in volume and are limited in weight to no more than 1.33 kilograms per 1U Cube.Suborbital reusable launch vehicles are managed for NASA through the Flight OpportunitiesProgram (https://flightopportunities.nasa.gov/	   ).Award: There will be no award associated with this announcement.Requested Information:The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded throughNASAs NSPIRES system (see Instructions below).Respondents are asked to provide information on a space flight project which could meet aparticular need for Earth science technology validation. Each response to the RFI shoulddescribe only one specific project and address the following topics, in this order:a. Indicate the program class: class 1 (&lt;$5M, &lt;= 3years) or class 2 (&lt;$20M,&lt;= 5years).b. Provide a description of the technology to be validated and its relevance to NASA'sEarth science needs.c. Provide a justification for why this particular technology or science measurementapproach needs space flight validation.d. Describe the system to be flown including the technology payload plus spacecraftaccommodation. Estimates of the mass, power, and data rate for the system should beprovided.e. Describe the approach for access to space (e.g. dedicated launch, secondary payload)as well as the orbit required.f. Provide an estimated total cost and schedule with any key details driving the cost.Cost should be broken down in terms of management, system engineering, payload,spacecraft, launch and operations. The schedule should indicate the length of the periodsfor development and operations.Instructions:Page Limitation: The response must be limited to 5 pages. A page is defined as one (1)sheet 8.5 x 11 inches with one inch margins using a minimum of 12-point font size fortext and 8-point for graphs. All responses submitted in response to this RFI must be submitted in electronic form viaNSPIRES, the NASA online announcement data management system, located athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/	 .

<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide <br />services as below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institute of Molecular Genetics Section of the Genome Technology Branch has upgraded the genotyping capabilities in the Finnish US Investigation of NIDDM (FUSION) genetics study to increase throughput and versatility as well as lower the cost of high throughput SNP analysis. In increasing the versatility we are able to optimize the type of genotyping reaction to facilitate smaller studies with a large number of samples as well as larger numbers of SNPs on few samples for association discovery studies.</p>
<p>NHGRI are starting an exciting new phase of the FUSION project. Skeletal muscle from the vastus lateralis, subcutaneous adipose tissue from the abdomen, and a skin biopsy that can be cultured into fibroblasts will be obtained from 100 FUSION participants with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 100 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 100 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics (T2D). A newly designed Illumina exome chip that will score for ~250,000 common and rare variants in exons, using data from the 1000G project as a reference set will be used in the research. Additionally, whole genome methylation analysis will be assessed using the Illumina 450K chip, which examines methylation sites covering 99% of the RefSeq genes and 96% of the CpG islands genome-wide. To obtain digital data on gene expression, total RNA from a portion of each tissue and from cultured fibroblasts will be subjected to RNA-seq. These rich and extensive data sets on the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and phenome of 300 individuals, to be generated over the course of the next year, will provide an opportunity for multiple complex analyses.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Performance</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The arrays will be processed at the NHGRI and NIH supported Center of Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) where the processes and expertise in Illumina arrays are well characterized and documented.</p>
<p>Therefore we are procuring the below items:<br />Items:</p>
<p>1. HumanExome BeadChip (48), Catalog Number: WG-353-1001-PRE, Units: One (1) Each.<br />2. HumanExome BeadChip (288), Catalog Number: WG-353-1002-PRE, Units: Six (6) Each.<br />3. Shipping and Insurance</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Dorothy Maxwell, Contract Specialist, at maxwelld@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by November 1, 2011 7:30 AM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<SUBJECT>Studies to Evaluate Toxicity Following Early Life Exposure to Test Articles for the National Toxicology Program
<SOLNBR>NTP2012002
<RESPDATE>111411
<CONTACT>Jennifer Smith, Contract Specialist, Email smithj3@niehs.nih.gov - Terry Wyche, Procurement Technician, Phone 919-541-7950, Fax 919-541-2712, Email wychetl@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC><strong>General Information:</strong><br />This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.<br />
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP) was established within the Department of Health and Human Services and charged with coordinating toxicological testing programs within the Public Health Service of the Department.  The NTP, as part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), is responsible for evaluating the toxic and carcinogenic potential of environmental agents that may pose a health hazard to citizens of the United States. The NTP requires support for the conduct of short- and long-term toxicity studies following pre- and postnatal exposure to a variety of test articles by various routes of exposure. This requirement is designed to study diverse agents that may include: environmental chemicals; food additives, colorants or flavorings; pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies; pesticides; ingredients found in a variety of consumer products including soaps and cosmetics; detergents and cleaners; nanomaterials; chemicals used in manufacturing or industrial settings, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />NIEHS is seeking capability statements from interested and qualified businesses to conduct toxicology studies for the NTP. These studies will support and assist the NTP research effort to evaluate the effects of early life exposure to test articles that may result in long term adverse effects.</p>
<p><strong>Project Details:</strong><br />For each test article studied, a detailed protocol outline will be provided by the Government to the testing laboratory.  In general, studies will involve daily dosing of rats or mice.  The anticipated routes of administration are gavage, dosed feed and dosed water.  Study duration may be from a few days up to 2 years.  Some tests may begin with time-mated animals, while others will begin with non-pregnant animals.  Treatment regimens, species used, endpoints to be measured, etc., may vary depending on specific chemicals to be tested and study goals.</p>
<p>Anticipated study designs will include (1) Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB), (2) NTP Modified One-Generation (MOG) studies with multiple cohorts (information on the NTP modified one-generation design may be found at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/About_NTP/BSC/2011/April/MOGDesign.pdf), and (3) Prenatal Developmental Toxicity studies.</p>
<p>The RACB study includes daily dosing of breeding pairs to produce F1a, F1b and F1c litters.  Offspring from F1c litters will be mated to produce F2a, F2b and F2c litters. The NTP MOG study generally begins with time-mated females delivering litters from which offspring are assigned to multiple cohorts for evaluation of a variety of endpoints including: developmental landmarks, reproductive indices, teratology, subchronic toxicity, histopathology and/or collection of biological samples. Other endpoints in the MOG such as neurotoxicity or evaluation of target organ toxicities may be required. In some cases, new testing paradigms may be developed with incorporation of unique endpoints.</p>
<p>Award of one or more cost-reimbursement, level of effort type contract is contemplated. The total estimated level of effort for each laboratory if, for example, two awards are made, is anticipated to be between 25,000 to 50,000 labor hours per year depending on the needs of the NTP. Each laboratory would be anticipated to conduct a mix of the above studies with more RACB and MOG studies conducted than Prenatal Developmental Toxicity studies. The mix of studies conducted may change from year to year.</p>

Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Ashlee.Bushell@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Ashlee Bushell, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, MS: TWB - 01-B10M, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools, and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Commission established the current framework for risk-informed regulation by issuing a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Policy Statement that stated the use of PRA technology should be increased in all regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art and in a manner that complements NRC's deterministic approach and traditional defense-in-depth philosophy.</p>
<p>PRA is a structured, analytical process that provides both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates of risk by (1) identifying potential sequences that can challenge system operations and lead to an adverse event, (2) estimating the likelihood of these sequences, and (3) estimating the consequences associated with these sequences, if they were to occur. By prioritizing significant risk contributors and characterizing key sources of uncertainty and their impact on results, PRA serves as a useful decisionmaking tool that can help focus thinking and limited agency resources to ensure safety. U.S. nuclear reactor PRAs are used to characterize three regimes of accident progression. A Level 1 PRA models system (plant and operator) response to various initiating events that challenge system operation to estimate reactor core damage frequency. A Level 2 PRA includes Level 1 PRA analyses and, in addition, models system and containment response to severe core damage accidents to estimate conditional containment failure probabilities, radioactive material release frequencies (e.g., large early release frequency), and various source term characteristics. Finally, a Level 3 PRA includes Level 2 PRA analyses and, in addition, models the transport and dispersion of released radioactive materials to estimate various offsite radiological health and economic consequence measures.</p>
<p>A full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving the reactor core as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools, dry storage casks, and multiple units). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decisionmaking and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety. Although Level 3 PRAs have since been performed to some extent within both the United States and international nuclear industries, NRC has not sponsored development of a Level 3 PRA since NUREG-1150 . In the more than two decades that have passed since the NUREG-1150 Level 3 PRAs were performed, numerous technical advances have been made that were not reflected in the NUREG-1150 PRA models. The staff has also identified additional scope considerations not previously considered that could be addressed by performing a new full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA.</p>
<p>During the Annual Commission Meeting on Research Programs, Performance, and Future Plans on February 18, 2010, the staff proposed a scoping study to evaluate the feasibility of performing a new full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA. On March 19, 2010, the Commission expressed conditional support for Level 3 PRA related activities and directed the staff to provide the Commission with various options for proceeding that include costs and perspectives on future uses for Level 3 PRAs. On July 7, 2011, the NRC staff responded to the SRM by providing three proposed options for proceeding with the Level 3 PRA development project. These three options consisted of (1) maintaining the status quo (i.e., continuing with evolutionary development of PRA technology); (2) conducting focused research to address identified gaps in existing PRA technology before performing a full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA; and (3) conducting a full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA. On September 21, 2011, the Commission approved a modified version of the third option which extended the completion schedule from three years to four years.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Capability Sought</span></strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing support for the Level 1 aspects of PRA modeling aspects associated with the development of a Level 3 PRA. This can include, but is not limited to, initiating event analysis, event tree development and analysis, system reliability model (e.g., fault tree) development and analysis, human reliability analysis, data analysis, accident sequence quantification, and uncertainty analysis. This support also includes PRA modeling of internal fires and floods, external events, low power and shutdown modes of reactor operation, non-reactor sources of radiological material (i.e., spent fuel pools and dry storage casks), and consideration of multi-unit effects.</p>
<p>Candidate contractors should have in-depth knowledge in the Level 1 PRA aspects described above in order to assist the NRC staff in identifying and resolving issues. Candidate contractors should also be technically creditable to respond to technical questions during ACRS presentations based on their in-depth knowledge resulting from their education and work experience.</p>
<p>Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA development project should please respond to the market research questions below and provide capability information on your staff's qualifications and your firm's corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts. For potentially available and qualified candidates, please provide the candidates' educational background, relevant years of work experience, and description of experience in performing PRAs and PRA-related activities, including any relevant publications.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Market Research Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Please provide the organization name, address, email address, website address and telephone number.<br /><br />2. Demonstrate that your organization possesses the "Capability Sought" in the section above.<br /><br />3. How long has your organization been in operation?<br /><br />4.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>StrategicWatch Development and Engineering Support</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.<br />NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Chief Technology Office (CTO) is conducting market research as part of the acquisition planning phase for the StrategicWatch Development and Engineering Support Capability Requirement.  This RFI will provide the CTO Team and the contracting officer the information needed to determine whether two or more Alliant Small Business vendors are capable of providing the needed capability to support this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government for forming a binding contract.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with software development, sustainment, and fielding of software applications, in general, and in support of the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System process, specifically.  All interested parties are requested to provide written responses to the criteria below.  A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide required services.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>During events of national significance, response time is important. To ensure appropriate action, decision-makers must be aware of their situation. As part the National Military Command System (NMCS) transformation initiative the situational awareness web framework (StrategicWatch) was created in the National Senior Leader Decision Support Service (NSLDSS) Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD). StrategicWatch is a Government developed, ExtJS 3 (http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) based web framework that makes use of real-time data mashup technology to provide a rich experience for users.  The framework consists of a desktop-like environment that contains different widgets displaying data in a variety of ways.  The commercial JackBe Presto (http://www.jackbe.com/) enterprise mashup server is used as a loosely coupled, underlying component of StrategicWatch that provides data-layer mashups using web services.  JackBe Presto provides users the ability to easily put together real-time data from many network sources using a graphical programming interface or by writing Enterprise Mashup Markup Language (EMML).</p>
<p>In addition, contracting support is expected to be leveraged to support JackBe Presto integration, development, and maintenance for the Global NetOps Information Sharing Environment (GNISE). GNISE is intended to provide Commmanders and decision makers at all levels - CC/S/A NetOps centers, US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) - with an ability to maintain Situational Awareness (SA) across the three primary activities of NetOps: Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Management (GEM), GIG Net Assurance (GNA), and GIG Content Management (GCM), including relevant, accurate and timely information about the availability, integrity and confidentiality status of its network connected components, as well as information about how events, incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities occurring within the GIG impact ongoing and planned missions across all DoD Joint Capability Areas. JackBe Presto is currently planned to be part of an Information Sharing framework that includes integration with Liferay Portal and interoperability with Ozone Widget Framework communities. Similar to its function in StrategicWatch, JackBe Presto will be leveraged to mashup disparate data sources and develop data visualization services within GNISE.</p>

<DESC>THE REQUEST FOR THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. 

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for potential sources and products for a passive solution to provide hearing conservation to the Warfighter.  Specifically, to identify passive products that not only protect hearing from high level energy sources but additionally provide a sense of presence at time when the user is not exposed to higher dB levels of sound.

Hearing loss secondary to blast trauma, is now the most common combat injury in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The use of passive hearing protection that protects against transient impact noise at the same time allowing ambient sound would enable Marines to continue to hear and respond in combat, thereby enhancing situational awareness while blocking and/or reflecting harmful blast shock waves in the ear canal.
  Current ear plugs and over the ear muffs block both loud sounds and the sound of normal speech.  As a result, they are not worn when needed, or are worn in a manner that permits normal verbal communication but that makes the devices ineffective for hearing protection,

MARCORSYSCOM is seeking information on hearing protection products, or products in development, that can meet the following specifications:

No electronic components.

Attenuates impact noise at 125 dB, 140 dB, 160 dB and 171 dB at least 30 dB

Maintain a Noise Reduction Rate (NRR) of 12 or less.  (NRR is a measure of how much noise earplugs block in the 30 decibel to 60 decibel volume range).

Not protrude from the ear and interfere with headphones or helmets.
 

Be available in multiple sizes to fit comfortably in the 5th percentile to 95th percentile Marines ear canal. 

Not be a custom mold design and should be considered a consumable product.

Material should be compatible with long term use. 

Responses should include:

Information regarding products that are currently in manufacture and can be readily purchased and/or information on products that could address the above specifications with minimal modifications.

Product information on specific passive hearing product to include sizing, materials and performance specifications in the areas of high level sound protection, ability to facilitate Situational Awareness, Ease of Use, Durability, and Acoustic Locate.
 

Independent Test Lab data supporting the performance claims for both high level sound attenuation and NRR.

Production lead time.

Information regarding fit and comfort.

Estimated unit pricing for the product to include estimated costs for any necessary product modification.

Manufacturing capabilities.

Information on any government contract vehicle your product is on (i.e. GSA, DLA, etc.)

Respondents are requested to include literature, brochures, business size, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the hearing protection specifications.  Material samples are welcome, however not required, and will not be returned.  Furnished written materials and any proprietary information will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.
  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  Responses shall be submitted not later than 14 November 2011 to Jennifer Glenn, at email address jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil or via FEDEX/UPS deliveries to Commander, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street Quantico VA 22134-6050, Attn: Jennifer Glenn, 703-432-3266.  Any/all questions regarding submission of materials should be addressed to Jennifer Glenn at jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil.  THE REQUEST FOR THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

Responses shall not include any classified material.  Responses received to this notice will not be returned.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  Information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time for publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  Availability of any future formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities announcement.<br><br>Objective<br>To collect information from knowledgeable sources such as recommendations, technical approach and/or brief component or system descriptions in accordance with the specifications below. This notice is for informational purposes only.<br><br>Specifications<br>GENERAL BACKGROUND<br><br>The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is interested in technology to demonstrate the ability of mobile compact superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) or a SMES combined with another technology as part of a military microgrid to provide load leveling and store a meaningful amount of energy for 10's of minutes to multiple hours and discharge the energy in support of a Contingency Operating Base (COB).  Information is requested in the form of recommendations, technical approach, and/or brief component or system description.<br><br>The remote locations of COBs create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These COBs are currently heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by bottled water and liquid fuel.  With the vast majority of electrical power provided by generators operating on liquid fuel, the more power needed the more fuel required.  Some studies estimate 30% of the liquid fuel delivered is used in generators to provide electrical power.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.  The delivered cost of fuel can easily total ten to twenty times its original purchase price.  <br><br>The Department of Defense (DoD) is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the energy self-sufficiency of COBs.  Development of military microgrids will be one of the emerging strategies to improve fuel efficiency for energy utilization and to reduce the logistics burden in the battlefield.  These microgrids may benefit from the use of a SMES or SMES combined with another technology for load leveling and energy storage due to the intrinsic advantages of SMES technology of high energy density and high rate of discharge and recharge. <br><br>SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST<br><br>Electric power at COBs is presently provided by motor generator sets of various sizes ranging from 2kW to 100kW. These generators can be fueled with either diesel or JP-8, a common military logistics fuel. The JP-8 is delivered via tanker truck over long distances. Generators frequently must operate at suboptimal capacity, resulting in wasted fuel consumption because they are not correctly matched to the load or the load varies over time.  The variation in the load can cause sags in the voltage potentially leading to the inopportune shut down of certain equipment.  In industry and commercial power applications, SMES technology has been used as an effective load leveling technology.  <br><br>The Government is interested in demonstrating if the SMES or SMES combined with another technology can provide both load leveling and energy storage.<br><br>In addition to load leveling, it is envisioned during times of excess generator capacity, the excess power can be stored in a SMES or SMES combined with another technology (for example, batteries) for use when more power is required.   For example, power demands are high during the day but low at night.  Generators are generally never shut off due to the difficulty of restarting or the need for some power.  During the night, while the power needs are low, the generators can run at an optimal level and the excess energy stored in the SMES or SMES combined with another technology.  <br><br>Given this SMES or SMES combined with another technology is for tactical applications, solutions must be mobile and compact.<br><br>Technologies, information, and questions of interest include:<br><br>1.	SMES available for testing immediately or in the near future.<br>2.	SMES combined with another technology available for testing immediately or in the near future.<br>3.	Discuss SMES hybrid technologies versus an independent SMES and energy storage unit.<br>4.	Discuss technical issues concerning why a SMES has not been used for long term energy storage? <br>5.	Describe the fundamental limitations and development issues associated with SMES for use as a long term energy storage device.<br>6.	Discuss technical issues, if any, related to fast discharge and recharge of the SMES.<br>7.	Compare energy storage of other technologies to that of SMES.<br>8.	What load leveling issues occur in military microgrids?<br>9.	For load leveling function, will a SMES have better performance than other techniques?<br>10.	Is a SMES the best option to meet both load leveling and energy storage requirement, or are other technologies needed to achieve these goals?<br>11.	What is the appropriate testing of SMES or SMES combined with another technology in a tactical microgrid to demonstrate utility for load leveling and energy storage?<br>12.	Provide information about existing military microgrids appropriately sized for a contingency operating base or otherwise. <br>13.	Provide information about microgrid simulator software/testbed.<br>14.	Provide information about electronics (power and control) for interfacing SMES to military microgrid.<br><br>Responses<br><br>All interested parties should notify this office in writing via email within the posted date.  Responses shall include: <br><br>(1) To what extent each of the specifications can be met. Include your type of business (i.e. commercial, academia) and whether your organization is large or small based on the 500 employee size standard that accompanies NAICS code 335911<br><br>(2) Past experience/ performance through the description of completed projects.<br><br>CONTENT AND FORMAT OF PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS:<br><br>The electronic copy of responses is to be in Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Acrobat 9 compatible format using a size 10 to 12 point font with one inch margins.  Following a review of the responses received, ARL may elect to request additional information, or schedule one-on-one meetings with some respondents to gain additional information. A submission should include:<br><br>1. A cover page labeled with the heading "SMES for Tactical Microgrids",including<br>the submitters name and affiliation and address, technical point of contact, telephone number, and e-mail address.<br><br>2. No more than four pages that may include: <br><br>a) Narrative describing how the approach could enhance the energy storage of a contingency base per the above technologies, information, and questions of interest.<br><br>b) Technical description of currently available or soon available devices or systems including dimensions, weight, inputs and outputs.<br><br>c) If you are responding with the help of other organizations or business partners, please identify these organizations and partners.<br><br><br>Responses to this sources sought synopsis are due no later than 11:59 PM eastern standard time 22 Nov 2011.

<DESC>The U.S Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Division of Acquisition Management, Contracts and Grants (AMCG), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Critical Path Institute (C-Path) and its Institute for Science and Global Policy (ISGP) to conduct a series of conferences with international stakeholders and governments. Through its ISGP, C-PATH can provide as a contractor to the HHS reports and products that provide insight into emerging S&amp;T issues, their policy significance, and potential policy considerations of other countries that affect EPID, FSS, and SB. As part of this effort, the perspectives of sub-national groups are required. The ISGP can provide the HHS with a systematic, comprehensive, and international approach to these issues. The ISGP uses an ongoing, structured method to consistently provide the desired information in a format usable by analysts across a variety of HHS programs and offices. The first step in this structured process relies on a strategic roadmap derived from interviews and correspondence with world-class experts in the EPID field. The resultant strategic roadmap articulates how the complex EPID topics can be effectively debated among policy makers and selected S&amp;T representatives through a series of conferences to be held over the subsequent one-year period.
<p><br />OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Programs within C-PATH's ISGP focus on those S&amp;T issues that have been given priority by those participating governments as being of significance in both domestic and international policy. By undertaking such a program, the ISGP focuses on three distinct, but related activities:</p>
<p>(1) Conducting interviews and correspondence with globally recognized subject matter experts designed to obtain their views of (i) the current realities that accurately characterize the S&amp;T topic, (ii) the scientifically credible opportunities and challenges available to effectively meet societal needs, and (iii) the policy issues (advantages and risks) associated with the S&amp;T topic that societies must consider. These views are used by the ISGP to prepare a Strategic Roadmap that describes a series of conferences based on extensive critical debates between scientists and policy makers from throughout the international community.</p>
<p>(2) Organizing and convening the conferences that are identified in the Strategic Roadmap. Each ISGP conference is conducted in a "not-for-attribution" environment with the scientific presenters selected by the ISGP and the policy/expert audience selected by each participating government.</p>
<p>(3) Preparing "not-for-attribution" summaries of each critical debate and obtaining areas of consensus and next steps from the participating country representatives. This information together with the eight policy position papers written by the scientific experts are published in a book prepared by the ISGP and made available publicly.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />Based on an EPID Strategic Roadmap, the organizational work needed to plan and convene an ISGP conference over next 12 months focusing on Emerging and Persistent Infectious Diseases issues is to be undertaken. The format for this conference needs to emphasize critical debates of written policy position papers prepared by subject-matter experts chosen by the ISGP for their credentials and articulation. The audience is to be international in nature and comprised of representatives from both the technical and the policy communities in the participating countries (currently, the United States, Italy, Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Singapore). The agenda and scientific participants for each conference are to be determined from interviews and correspondence with recognized S&amp;T experts who are associated with a respected academic or scientific organization and having an international perspective. Attention is to be given to identifying relevant policy issues and their potential societal impacts. The conference is to be conducted under not-for-attribution environment. Not-for-attribution reports are to be prepared by the ISGP staff to reflect the discussions within each conference concerning the state-of-the-art scientific choices for addressing EPID/ FSS/SB issues and the policy significance of the emerging EPID/ FSS/SB capabilities (aka "technology issues"), perspectives of various social and demographic groups, and potential for impacts on societies considered.</p>
<p>Requirement/Tasks <br />Four primary tasks are required for fulfillment of this contract: (i) update and more fully integrate relevant scientific and policy issues concerning FSS and SB into the EPID Strategic Roadmap using interviews, correspondence, and the review of national and international reports, (ii) select scientific presenters, undertake organizational activities (contacting potential venue sites, examining travel options, and preparing ISGP staff for participating) needed to convene an ISGP conference on EPID/ FSS/SB, (iii) contribute to preparing not-for-attribution summaries of the presentations, discussions, debates, and caucuses from the EPID/ FSS/SB conference for delivery to HHS, (iv) contribute to the briefing of HHS personnel and selected invitees following the ISGP conference on EPID. <br />The contractor shall accomplish the following:<br />&bull; 4.1 Task One (Update and Integrate EPID/ FSS/SB issues into the Strategic Roadmap): Based on collaborations with subject-matter experts in the US and abroad, those FSS and SB issues that are of importance in the examination of EPID will be integrated into the conference agenda of an ISGP conference. The selection process needed to identify the appropriate scientific participants invited to prepare policy position papers on relevant scientific and policy issues will be added to the processes used for identifying EPID scientific participants. <br />&bull; 4.2 Task Two (Select EPID/ FSS/SB presenters and contribute to the organizing and convening of an EPID conference): The contractor shall select scientific presenters and help logistically organize and convene an ISGP conference on EPID/ FSS/SB. The process begins with the selection of about eight subject-matter experts for a conference. These scientific experts are invited to prepare concise position papers on a specific aspect of the EPID/ FSS/SB topics. The format for the ISGP conference focuses on critical debates of the position papers (about 90 minutes for each scientific participant). These debates are led by the audience of policy attendees selected by each participating country.<br />&bull; 4.3 Task Three (Assist in the preparation of the not-for-attribution summary for an EPID/FSS/SB conference): The contractor's staff will attend all debates and caucuses to take notes reflecting the not-for-attribution presentations, discussions, debates, and caucuses. The resultant book containing this information is available to the HHS.<br />&bull; 4.4 Task Four (Brief of HHS and its invitees concerning the ISGP conference on EPID/ FSS/SB): At the invitation of HHS, the contractor will conduct a briefing in the Washington, D.C., area specifically for HHS personnel and its selected invitees concerning the results of the EPID/ FSS/SB conference.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>(i) Technical Capability: The item(s) offered will be evaluated as providing or complying with all the requirements set forth the specification/statement-of-work.  This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability.

AWARD MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MADE TO THE FIRM WHO SUBMITS THE LOWEST PRICED PROPOSAL. In the case of equal ratings of past performances, proposed delivery schedule, and technical evaluation, price will be the deciding factor for award.  <br><br>(A)  Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar quantities under the same or similar circumstances.  An example which is considered to be ideally on-point is one which satisfied the same technical requirement for the same quantity, provided to a Government customer, and within the same delivery timeframe as required under this solicitation.  It is not required to submit examples which are ideally on-point; however, offerors should strive to provide those examples which are as relevant as possible. <br>         <br>(B)  Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to: performance of the equipment and services provided; timeliness of delivery;  willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes;  cost control;  processing of warranty claims;  performance of maintenance agreements;  availability of general customer support.  <br><br>(C)   Three (3) examples of past performance shall be included in the offeror's proposal.  Each example shall have the following information:<br><br>Contract or Sales Number;<br>Date of Sale;<br>Dollar Value of the Contract<br>Equipment and services provided;<br>Customer/Agency Name;<br>Customer Point of Contact (POC) and position within the company/agency;<br>Customer POC telephone number.<br><br>(D)   Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three.  Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance.  <br><br>(E)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br><br>(F)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available.<br><br>(G)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror.  <br><br>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS
All offerors shall submit a quote consisting of a separate (1) technical approach volume and (2) price volume.  The volumes shall be as follows:  Volume One:  Technical Quote and Volume Two:  Price Quote.  Each volume shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of evaluation of the other.
Basis of Award:  the Government will make an award based upon best value.  Technical factors as a whole are more important than price.  The evaluation factors are as follows in descending order of importance.
a.  Qualifications and Experience of Proposed Personnel;  b.  Technical Approach, and c.  Past Performance.
Volume 1:  Technical Quote.  
The technical quote must discuss the proposed management approach in sufficient detail to clearly and concisely demonstrate that the Offeror has an understanding of all requirements specified in the Statement of Work.
The technical quote shall not contain price information; however, resource information such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc. must be contained in the technical quote so that the Offeror's understanding of the detail and complexity of the requirements may be evaluated.
1.a.  Qualifications and Experience of Proposed Personnel.  
The contractor shall demonstrate that current and proposed staff has an appropriate range of relevant academic and applied experience as well as licensures.  The technical quote shall contain resumes of the proposed personnel along with a copy of their applicable licenses.
1.b.  Technical Approach.  The Contractor shall describe its technical approach to accomplish each of the tasks delineated in the Statement of Work.
1.c.  Past Performance:  The Contractor shall provide recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items, contract numbers, points of contracts with telephone numbers, and other relevant information.  When evaluating past performance, the Government will focus on the areas of Quality of Service, Timeliness of Performance, Price/Cost Control and Customer Satisfaction.  Offerors should note that Past Performance related to the "quality" and how well a Contractor performed the services under a contract.
Volume 2:  Price Quote.  
The Offeror shall prepare a firm fixed price quote that contains all information necessary to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the costs proposed.
All items are critical, as the Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposal for reasonableness and completeness/accuracy.  An analysis will be completed on a "total price" basis consistent with a fixed price methodology, counting base and option periods as inclusive of the total fixed price.
Questions Submission:  Questions must be submitted electronically via email to  mike.perry@bia.gov.  Offerors shall also reference the Solicitation number in the subject line of their questions.
Proposal Submission:  Proposals must be submitted in two hard copies to BIA, Albuquerque Acquisition Office, Attn:  Michael Perry, 1001 Indian School Road, Ste 347, Albuquerque, NM 87104.  Offeror shall reference the Solicitation number in the subject line of their proposal.  The Proposal response date is November 15, 2011.   
Basis of Award:  Award will be made the Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of evaluated factors offering the best overall value to the Government.  This will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit with differences in price to the Government.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical merit.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical merit.

The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. <br>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. <br>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br>(g) <br>(1) <br>(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. <br><br>52.212-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.<br>An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Language addition under the 52.212-2 -- EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS  on page 7:
Overall, the Government considers price less important than the above technical evaluation factors when combined.
Language has been Added on Page 8, under "Price" to include the bolded areas:
Overall, the Government considers price less important than the above technical evaluation factors  when combined.  But as technical quotations approach parity, price will become more important.  Notwithstanding this, the realism of quoted prices will be evaluated as a reflection of the Offeror's understanding of the requirements.  The quoted prices will be evaluated separately but in conjunction with the technical quotation elements.  A quoted price that is considered by the Government to be too low to accomplish the quoted technical approach may constitute a potential performance risk to the Government in terms of quality and ability to meet delivery schedules.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the C-20 and C-37 aircraft. CLS includes all support actions required for operating and maintaining the aircraft, aircraft subsystems, and support equipment. Two levels of support are required for this effort, full and partial CLS. Additionally, other Gulfstream aircraft operated or managed by the Government may use the non-recurring portion of this contract on an over and above basis. The contractor shall support any changes in the location, quantity and/or type of C-20 and/or C-37 aircraft under this contract. If necessary, the Contractor and the Government will enter into negotiations to determine the impact of increasing or decreasing coverage or change of location of aircraft. <br />The C-20 and C-37 CLS program supports sixteen (16) C-20s and nineteen (19) C-37s purchased from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and support for four (4) additional aircraft for parts only. The C-20 and C-37 is a militarized version of the FAA-airworthiness certificated Gulfstream GIII, GIV, GV and G550 aircraft as identified in PWS Table 1-1.

These aircraft are equipped with specialized mission communication stations. The C-20 and C-37 mission is two-fold: the first mission is for the military services to provide worldwide airlift support for senior military leaders and Government officials. The second is for the Navy and Marine C-20G aircraft, equipped with a cargo door, to primarily provide long range, medium airlift, logistics support. The C-20 and C-37 fleet is subject to long and short term deployments. <br />The Contractor shall maintain the fleet IAW Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved maintenance standards to maintain the aircraft FAA Airworthiness/Type Certification.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />RESILIENCY AND ADAPTIVE LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE (RALI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Air Mobility Command is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Part of the market research is to publish on FedBizOpps a Request for Information (RFI) seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services, as described in the tasks below. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to this RFI are cautioned that THIS SYNOPSIS/RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a request for proposal. The Government is not obligated to and shall not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information you provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background/Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force (AF) Air Mobility Command's (AMC) priority is to develop a comprehensive fitness model with a component designed to increase proactive coping, self-management and leadership skills to enhance individual resilience. Cultivating these skills in our Airmen will ensure that AMC maintain a cadre of balanced, healthy, self-confident Airmen whose physical, mental, spiritual and social fitness and resiliency enable them to effectively manage, and even experience personal and professional growth in response to stressors associated with military service, including a high operational tempo, deployments, recurrent change and the requirement to maintain high personal and professional standards of conduct. Military members face all of these challenges in addition to family, home and community responsibilities and stressors, which may be exacerbated by the rigors of military life. The current effort is intended to support and train individual Airmen in small groups to increase resilience across Air Mobility Command. Goals include:</p>
<p>- Supporting positive coping with challenge and adversity<br />- Reducing negative outcomes <br />- Accomplishing the Air Force global mission</p>
<p>AMC is seeking a program that could train Airmen in skills, attitudes and behaviors to promote individual resilience in conjunction with leadership skills to increase organizational resilience is the objective. Specifically, AMC would like targeted intensive, skills based, small group, experiential resilience training for Airmen, supervisors, middle managers, senior leaders and spouses to be provided by full time professional Resilience Trainers at our 12 AMC installations. The goal is to train 100% of our active duty and DOD civilian employees and a substantial proportion of military spouses. The intervention should be a state of the art, evidence based multimodal educational experience that can be customized to the needs of our target population, manualized for standardized implementation and deployed to Air Force bases within months. Outcomes related to current negative outcomes would be targeted, including: suicide events, alcohol related misconduct, disciplinary actions and family maltreatment. Standardized measures of resilience and related constructs would be employed to assess change in self-reported attitudes, skills and behaviors. Qualitative reports/personal accounts and participant satisfaction surveys would also be employed in assessing the overall value of the program</p>
<p><strong>3. Required Tasks</strong></p>

<p>Background: <br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) mission is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosives [CBRNE]) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, and counter the threat, and mitigate its effects. DTRA's Research and Development Enterprise is the focal point for identifying and developing innovative technologies to combat WMD and is responsible for designing, testing, and demonstrating emerging technologies to be adopted by the Services, Combatant Commands, and other agencies. Following guidance and operational concepts of senior DoD officials, the Research and Development Enterprise provides solutions across the full range of CBRNE WMD technologies.</p>
<p>DTRA currently has a requirement to develop and maintain meteorological systems for support to consequence assessment and management (CA/CM) functions. DTRA's current systems are composed of:</p>
<p>1. A high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) system based on the NCAR/Penn State MM5; and <br />2. A 24/7/365 meteorological data server (MDS) system and Weather Client software application.</p>
<p>The NWP system generates mesoscale forecasts over user-configurable locations and time periods and at a variety of horizontal (typically 12, 4, and 1.33 km) and vertical resolutions. The MDS retrieves, processes, stores, and serves observational data along with gridded NWP data from a variety of internal and external sources (e.g., the National Center for Environmental Prediction [NCEP], the Air Force Weather Agency [AFWA], and the US Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographic Center [FNMOC]). These systems are located on Ft Belvoir, VA and Kirtland AFB, NM on both DoD unclassified and classified networks and systems. Therefore, they must meet DoD information assurance standards.</p>
<p>The requirement is to build upon existing operational and research and development (R&amp;D) meteorological computing platforms and prototype capabilities through research, design, development, engineering, publication, and upgrade of methodologies and technologies. The DTRA operational NWP capability must be made available on-demand in a "cold-start" mode meaning that potential operators of the system (i.e., engineers and scientists) not necessarily versed in the details of NWP should be provided with the ability to initialize an NWP forecast, verify the output, and process results that are operationally compatible with DTRA and DoD atmospheric transport and dispersion (ATD) codes (e.g., the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability [HPAC], the Integrated WMD Toolset [IWMDT], and the Joint Effects Model [JEM]). The MDS system must be capable of serving weather data to 1000 simultaneous users, ensuring data is parsed, formatted, and transmitted successfully within five minutes. In addition, Weather Client software compatible with DTRA and DoD CA/CM systems that directly access MDS must be maintained and further developed. Both the NWP and MDS systems reside on DoD classified and unclassified networks and must meet DoD information assurance standards and be PKI and CAC accessible.</p>
<p>The end-state goal is a comprehensive meteorological capability to serve DTRA and DoD CA/CM functions. The end system must include both an in-house, high-resolution NWP capability and the ability to serve NWP and observational data in appropriate formats seamlessly and securely to DTRA and DoD customers.</p>
<p>The following are projected task areas:</p>
<p>Research, Development, and Integration:<br />a) Conduct NWP research including effect of resolution on ATD, optimal mesoscale ensemble configuration and use in ATD applications, verification and validation methods/implementation and graphical display.<br />b) Conduct MDS research including methods for determination of "typical day" atmospheric conditions and best performing NWP models.<br />c) Conduct R&amp;D of processes to assist in the selection of appropriate meteorological data based on defined CBRNE scenarios and model performance or meteorological observation data density.<br />d) Conduct R&amp;D of processes to retrieve oceanographic data for use in water bourn transport and dispersion tools such as Incident Command Tool for Drinking Water Protection (ICWater) and System for Hazard Assessment of Released Chemicals (SHARC).<br />e) Conduct R&amp;D of high-resolution climatology information for user defined domains.<br />f) Conduct research on the effects of climate change on emerging infectious diseases in support of global biosurveillance efforts.<br />g) Explore, investigate, and design new methods for creating, capturing, storing, assessing, and modifying large amounts of meteorological data. This may include dynamically accessing in-house NWP systems and external providers. <br />h) Provide technical assistance/training on the use and maintenance of the MDS and NWP systems as well as assist in the incorporation/installation of upgrades/patches to the system at both locations.<br />i) Develop and assist in the integration of Weather Client software into DTRA and DoD CA/CM tools.</p>
<p>System Administration/Maintenance:<br />a) Provide 24/7/365 on-site or remote system support.<br />b) Deliver on-site system hardware/software upgrades. Provide recommendations on the state of the art, to include developmental, hardware and software to enhance daily operations<br />c) Assist in the migration to virtualization on the DTRA "Mission Enclave" of the existing and any developed systems.<br />d) Provide systems monitoring tools to include systems performance and production in the case of the NWP, and status of ingest, parsing, formatting and transmission of data for the MDS. <br />e) Maintain awareness of current meteorological products and make recommendations for addition of new grids / observation to enhance operations.<br />f) Perform Information Assurance duties to include: vulnerability assessments, threat assessments, mitigation, and reporting activities in order to provide safeguards of information. <br />g) Maintain and administer user accounts for all meteorological systems on both the unclassified and classified networks.</p>
<p>Travel:<br />a) Travel to the DTRA and its customer sites will be required for meetings, technical direction/discussions, training, system upgrades, and installation of Life Cycle Management (LCM) high-performance computer(s) and software.</p>
<p>Security:<br />a) An active secret level (minimum) security clearance will be necessary for access and maintenance of DTRA systems.</p>
<p>Subject Matter Expertise:<br />Be available and able to provide key subject-matter expertise to support DTRA Reachback analysts, Combatant Commands, and other federal, state, and local agencies with technical advice during exercises and operational needs as they pertain to the meteorological system and its workings. Additionally, support and train subject-matter experts that will be using the system for exercises and real-world scenarios.</p>

<DESC>Modified to correct RFP number to N61340-12-R-0013.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to complete a Technical/Visual Upgrade for one AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 located at MCAS, Camp Pendleton, CA.  In addition, there is an option to complete another Technical/Visual Upgrade for one AH-1 WST device 2F136A-1 at MCAS New River, NC.  All of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) in the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be options except for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 and the corresponding Technical Data and Information CLIN.  All of the CLINS in the RFP will be Firm Fixed Price.  Each AH-1 WST device will have CLINS for Provisioned Item Orders, an Initial Operational Assessment Period (IOAP), After Action Review (AAR) Software Replacement, Air Conditioning, and Advanced Simulation Technology Incorporated (ASTI) upgrades.
  The primary purpose of these trainer modifications is to increase training system supportability and reduce total life cycle support costs.
The AH-1 WST supports the AH-1W Warfighter Program, the Fleet Readiness Squadron (FRS) HMLAT-303 and the Marine Aviation Training System Site (MATSS) at Camp Pendleton, CA to meet AH-1W pilot throughput requirements.  Once upgraded, the AH-1 WST will be technically capable of continuing to accomplish Training & Readiness (T&R) Syllabus events designated to be completed in a simulator.  HMLAT-303 has a requirement to train AH-1W pilots through the end of the projected aircraft service life in FY20.  The estimated delivery date for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-2 upgrade is 21 months after contract award.
  In addition, the estimated delivery date for the AH-1 WST device 2F136A-1 is 21 months after the exercise of option.
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 333319, with a size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is set-aside entirely for Small Business firms. Solicitation number N61340-12-R-0013 will be forthcoming on or about 22 November 2011.   However, a DRAFT Statement of Work, DRAFT Performance Specification, and DRAFT Contract Data Requirements Lists will be made available via FedBizOpps and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website on the day of this posting.  Offerors are requested to review all of the DRAFT documents.  Any feedback or questions regarding the DRAFT documents or this acquisition needs to be submitted to the Government no later than 4:00PM, 4 November 2011 to Reginald P.
 Souffrant at reginald.souffrant@navy.mil.  
The Government is planning to offer a Site Visit to interested potential small business Offerors on 15 November 2011 from 9:00AM to 4:00M PST at MATSS Camp Pendleton, flight simulator, building 2394, room 227, Camp Pendleton, CA.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center requires contractor support to provide technical, analytical, and administrative support services for the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR).  
The Agency has the responsibility to investigate chemical and microbiological contaminant occurrence to characterize drinking water threats.  EPA relies on independent research efforts but also is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest of these is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  The UCMR is a cyclic monitoring program that allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water.  Every five years EPA selects, through the process of regulatory proposal and promulgation, a new group of contaminants for monitoring.  Data collected under UCMR can then be correlated with the consumer population to conduct an assessment of contaminant exposure.  This assessment supports OGWDW?s mandate to make determinations on the regulation of currently unregulated contaminants.
The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small businesses with the capability to perform all or a portion of the requirements defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for potential small businesses sources.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million.
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages, and no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party?s demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience, and past performance in each of the areas included in the paragraph below.  Additionally, interested parties should include a discussion of the capability of their accounting system or ability to implement a cost accounting system required of a cost-type contract.  Previous experience with cost-type government contracts should be discussed.  Interested parties should describe their ability to provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the efforts required by the Draft PWS.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
Tasks anticipated in this procurement include: 1) Coordinate the preparation and distribution of UCMR sample collection kits and collection of samples at selected small systems; 2) Coordinate and perform the collection of finished drinking water samples at selected small public water systems; 3) Provide outreach support to the UCMR implementation effort; 4) Collect and track data for the UCMR program; 5) Assist with contacting public water systems (or States) regarding UCMR responsibilities and monitoring requirements; 5) Assist with the design of UCMR Monitoring Plans and coordinate State review; 6) Assist with oversight and coordination of the UCMR laboratory approval program; 6) Produce reports and analyses in furtherance of regulatory development activities. 7) Provide administrative support in the planning and execution of workshops, conferences, or public meetings.
The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick-turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water.  The resulting contract will be a follow-on to contract EP-C-06-041 with Great Lakes Environmental Consultants.
The proposed contract will have a base period consisting of 12 months with five option periods of 12 months each, for a total potential period of performance of six years.  Total maximum level of effort for this six-year period of performance is 130,400 direct labor hours.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed-fee/level-of-effort contract will result from this solicitation.
Conflict of interest disclosures will be required from offerers under the standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) to certify that an offerer is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or to disclose any potential conflict of interest of which it is aware.  The offerer will also be required to comply with EPAAR 1552.209-71, requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award.
The current projected start date of the contract is July 1, 2012.  The RFP will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number SOL-CI-12-00010.  It may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov).  The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.  All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.  It is the responsibility of offerors to check FedBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available after December 1, 2011.
Interested parties should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to (Courtney Stallworth, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or stallworth.courtney@epa.gov) no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis.

<DESC>The Force Health Protection Program of the Warfighter Performance Department at the Office of Naval Research (Code 342) is soliciting full proposals for Saving Lives with Emergency Medical Perflourocarbons in the Field (SEMPer Fi).
<p><br />Statement of Problem: Combat readiness and mission effectiveness are at risk of negative impact from extreme environmental conditions. Environmental stresses can impair soldiers' cognitive and physical abilities. Current military operations require the Warfighter to perform underwater (in underwater sites with unique hazards including decompression sickness and hyperbaria), at altitude (at elevations that may induce hypoxia, mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary/cerebral edema), and on land (where blast poses serious risks). Current methods of mitigating environmental hazards are not deployable far forward, or have long-lasting side effects. The requirement is for medical technologies that are deployable as far forward as possible in the medical care system.</p>
<p>Objective: To develop medical technologies that address risks associated with operations in extreme environments (at altitude and&nbsp;on land). Medical devices will need to obtain FDA approval (510k), and biologics and pharmaceuticals will need to obtain Investigational New Drug (IND) approval and complete Phase I clinical trials, if not already approved. If already approved, biologics and pharmaceuticals must be approved for the new indication. It is anticipated that individual proposals will be submitted to three separate topic areas: (1) RESERVED, (2) SEMPer Fi at Altitude AND (3) SEMPer Fi on Land (blast).</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Information Tool Designers, Inc., (ITD), to support a previously developed government-owned airborne network security simulator (ANSS) to develop an ANSS scenario and experiment for key airborne network security technologies with the goal of providing minimum recommendations (e.g., security checklists). The ANSS scenario and experiment shall include a use case, functional description, and architecture. The Volpe Center also requires the contractor to review and provide comments to ensure technical completeness and accuracy of the ANSS aircraft equipment manufacturer engine heath and usage monitoring system Penetration Test Report being developed by the UK Center for Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). The contractor shall also support teleconferences with an aircraft equipment manufacturer and the Volpe Center regarding an aircraft equipment manufacturer's In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) ANSS Penetration Testing and this activity shall require a trip to an aircraft equipment manufacturer. The contractor shall support two teleconferences to discuss agenda items, such as: technical discussions with an aircraft equipment manufacturer regarding safety and security requirements for the IFE system, possible future Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET) on the IFE system, operational security scenarios for ANSS testing, and IFE security control requirements. The purpose of the aircraft equipment manufacturer trip will be to participate in a demonstration of the IFE system and continue follow-up discussions from the prior two teleconferences (no preparation for the trip will be required by the Contractor). In addition, the Volpe Center is supporting the FAA in developing a Draft Aircraft Security Catalog/Airborne Network Security Guidance that is consistent with the DHS CSET tool. The Contractor shall develop the Guidance Document that instructs FAA certifiers on minimum level of security controls for specific types of airborne network components and FAA plans to develop an FAA Advisory Circular in 2011/2012 based on this guidance.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research and prepare a report that will be used for input for the development of cyber-security recommended practices to be incorporated in the Security Guidance Document that can be referenced from regulations, standards, and guidance. Contractor support shall include: meeting coordination with Volpe and FAA, and participation, agenda development, briefing development, coordination with document authors, content development/review, and bi-weekly teleconferences. The following items are the 3 major sections of the document that the Contractor shall provide input on:<br />&bull; General Guidance for the Aircraft Certification Offices (ACOs) - High-level document referencing checklist tools to aid in this determination, templates for special conditions/issue papers and security plans<br />&bull; Supplementary Material - Issue Paper/Special Conditions templates<br />&bull; Recommended Best Practices - Minimum security baseline recommendations for securing standard Aircraft Components and archetypes and the Contractor shall attend an automotive workshop with pertinent public sector and private sector automotive and aviation industry experts to perform a sample risk assessment of automobile control system applications. The Contractor shall develop high-level use case and risk assessment that can be used as a template to perform a future in-depth risk assessment. The contractor shall develop a preliminary Automotive Systems Characteristic Report which will be a key element of the overall assessment. The contractor shall use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf as guidance.</p>
<p><br />Travel will be required to the following locations: Washington DC; Seattle, WA, and CA.</p>

<DESC>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the Government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Although "proposal," "offeror," and "contractor" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />2. The USSOCOM Program Executive Office for Rotary Wing is soliciting information to identify innovative technical solutions to address Special Operations Forces (SOF) requirements for a low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) capability on special operations aircraft.<br /><br />3. Responses to this RFI should assume no United States Government provided data for MH-47G and MH-60M variants. Responses should identify the data necessary for system development and integration. Responses should define how said data will be obtained; if teaming arrangements are used to meet data needs, the RFI response should identify potential teaming arrangements and roles and responsibilities. The prime contractor will be responsible for the integrated TF/TA system performance.<br /><br />4. The Government is interested in system solutions composed of production ready components. [i.e., minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 as defined by the Department of Defense (DOD) Acquisition Guidebook (July 29, 2011) and a minimum Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 7 as defined by the DOD Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Deskbook (May 2, 2011)]. The TF/TA systems and/or components not currently meeting a TRL 7 and a MRL 7 should include a description of the maturation activities and overall schedule, and cost required to support the objectives in Paragraph 5 of this RFI. <br /><br />5. Respondents to this RFI should describe their capability (i.e., hardware, software, integration experience) to meet and/or exceed each of the following objectives:<br /><br />a. Safe terrain following that includes: <br /><br />i. Five selectable set clearance planes (SCP) between 100 and 1000 feet above ground level.<br /><br />ii. Peak crossing tolerance of +20%/-15% of SCP in rain rates from 10 millimeters/hour.<br /><br />iii. Maintaining TF performance in straight and turning flight (6 degrees per second) throughout aircraft operating envelope for various aircraft configurations from 5 to 290 knots ground speed. <br /><br />iv. Flight path vector data presentation based on active sensor terrain data over water and all types of terrain, including sand, ice, and snow covered and man-made obstacles. <br /><br />v. Group-B weight less than 175 lbs. <br /><br />
<p>b. LPI/LPD capabilities.<br /><br />c. Provide a TF sub-mode that integrates the TF/TA system with the aircraft flight controls.</p>
<p>d. Integrate TF/TA guidance through the flight director display capability on both heads up and heads down display devices.</p>
<p>6. In particular, the government is interested in the following information:</p>
<p>a. The capability your system can provide. Provide a technical description of the solution to include estimated weight, power, and key system interfaces and data exchange requirements.</p>
<p>b. Responses should address any safety concerns/considerations and integration challenges associated with integration of the proposed TF/TA system with the aircraft's autopilot.</p>
<p>c. A funding profile for your proposed solution with break outs for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and procurement funds. Identify the level of engineering design, integration, software development, and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) required. Estimate RDT&amp;E funding required and discuss the schedule for the development/integration effort. Estimate procurement funding required through Initial Operational Capability (IOC). The IOC is defined as having eight modified aircraft plus two spares and all sustainment and training requirements in place.</p>
<p>d. Your relevant experience with recent MH-47 and MH-60 aircraft modification, software development, and integration efforts. Highlight any TF/TA development and integration experience, to include associated aircrew training solutions, that is pertinent. Supporting exhibits such as drawings, concepts, schedule, and cost may also be included in the response.</p>
<p>e. Provide a notional schedule clearly showing contract award, long lead procurement, production milestones, training/training system events, technical order development, contractor test and evaluation, US Army DT&amp;E and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E), and logistics/sustainment events with assets available and IOC. For notional schedule purposes, the Government suggests the following baseline:</p>
<p>Notional Program Schedule Dates</p>
<p>Request for Proposals (RFP) Release - Apr 2012<br />Proposals Due to Government - Jun 2012<br />Contract Award - Nov 2012<br />IOC - Oct 2015</p>
<p>7. Responses to this RFI shall be limited to 15 pages in length, not including the cover page. Do not submit classified data. It is desirable, but not required, that responses be submitted on CD-ROM in an electronic format compatible with Microsoft Windows/Office with no macros. Two copies of the paper submittals shall be submitted; this is in addition to, or in lieu of the CD submittal. Any materials, electronic or paper, containing proprietary/competition sensitive information shall be conspicuously and legibly marked with an appropriate restrictive legend. Proprietary/competition sensitive material appropriately marked will be protected from disclosure. <br /><br />8. Your response must be received no later than&nbsp;30 November 2011, 4:00 PM EDST.
