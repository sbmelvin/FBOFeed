B.   Past Performance 

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the contract requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.  

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it related to all acquisition requirements such as cost, schedule, and performance, including standards of good workmanship; the administration aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)

Past performance findings will be highly influential in determining the relative merits and risks associated with the offeror’s proposal in a comparative assessment with all competitors.  The Government will evaluate the reputation and quality of the offeror’s past performance.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to other offerors.   Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  In investigating the offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the offeror and may consider information from other sources. 

C.    Price/Cost Evaluation

Price/Costs shall be provided in the format identified in Section L and will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)   As discussed in FAR 15.404-1(d), cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror's proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirement; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror's technical proposal. Realism of prices and costs against technical/management proposals may be evaluated as a part of the overall evaluation. Costs will be evaluated as an objective and subjective factor.  All cost and pricing information required by Section L shall be provided and will be used to determine its allowability, allocability and reasonableness relative to the work to be performed under the proposed contract.  The negotiated rates for field overhead, prime’s overhead on subcontractors, prime’s home office overhead, and prime’s profit will be incorporated into the successful offeror’s contract and will be applied to the direct costs of all contract modifications, additive and deductive, (excluding modifications to exercise options).

<CONTACT>Fred Picavet Contract Officer 5595653180     ;
<DESC>The National Park Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, has identified a requirement to solicit offers to drill a water well at Sheep Creek in the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon National Park.  This solicitation is for full and open competition and is not set-aside.  This project involves drilling a test hole to determine the suitability for a potable well to support replenishing an existing potable water tank. If the water capacity and quality is suitable for consumption, the installation of a complete operational drinking water well will be installed. If the capacity of the well does not meet the water replenishment requirement, a second test hole will be drilled in order to install a second well. The National Park Service encourages and welcomes the participation of all small business firms, minority-owned businesses, and women-owned business concerns.  The solicitation, N8564070507, will be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's (DOI) National Business Center (NBC) website, http://ideasec.nbc.gov, approximately 15 days after this announcement.  Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the above web site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the Central Contractors Register (CCR) on the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Submission date for offers will be approximately 30 days after issuance of the solicitation. The Government anticipates an award of a firm fixed price contract with a magnitude between $100,000 and $250,000.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 237110 with a size standard for Small Business of $31.0 million.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct a wind tunnel test in a Polysonic Wind Tunnel (PSWT).	The Orion Vehicle is the payload for the AresI and is composed of the Service Module (SM), Comand Module (CM) and the Launch Abort System (LAS), which when used to abort the CM to save the crew becomes the Launch Abort Vehicle (LAV).  Currently there is a study underway to assess the possibility of Alternate Launch Abort Systems (ALAS) in order to improve structural efficiency and aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of the LAV.  Any configuration changes to the LAV can have significant impact on the entire AresI vehicle.  The AresI is particularly susceptible to changes in nose geometry (i.e., LAV) which can change configuration drag and stability and control characteristics. Therefore a combination of Computational Fluid Dynamic calculations and experimental results are required for a valid assessment of these effects. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known responsible source.  To support the assessment of possible ALAS configuration effects on the AresI, an existing 0.01-scale ( ~ 38” long) wind tunnel model, which has been tested in the PSWT, will be modified by NASA/LaRC as required and provided for testing in the PSWT.  The proposed Polysonic wind tunnel test covers the Mach range 0.4-4.0, providing aerodynamic pressure data for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Alternate Launch Abort System (ALAS) Project. This is required to support aerodynamic loads database validation in support of vehicle outer mold line refinement.  This facility allows the use of the existing model and sting hardware, which will provide savings in both setup time and cost. There are no NASA facilities available with this Mach range and size. The Boeing Polysonic tunnel is the only known blow-down facility with the specific Mach number range, Reynolds number, and size to satisfy the wind tunnel testing requirement. Also, to eliminate tunnel to tunnel differences, both the force and moment model and the pressure model should be tested in the same facilities.	The force and moment model was tested in the Boeing Polysonic facility due to AresI’specific test requirements, so for the complimentary pressure model, the Boeing Polysonic facility is also required.   The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 5, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

TITLE:  Information Fusion for Salience Analysis 

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 07-06 - IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 26 Jan 2007; FY 08 by 31 Aug 07; FY 09 by 31 Aug 08 and, FY 10 by 31 Aug 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background: Joint Publication 2-01.3 "Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for the Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (JIPB)" describes the JIPB process, which focuses on defining the battlespace environment, describing the battlespace's effects, evaluation of the threat, and determination of adversary courses of action (COA).

Research programs, such as the Automated Assistance with Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (A2IPB), have begun to provide software tools for organizing the vast quantity of information necessary to support the JIPB process.  However, development of key IPB products is still a manual process, and there is a critical lack of software tools to support automated (or even semi-automated) development of the IPB key products.  

There are a variety of technical disciplines that are applicable to information fusion research.  Examples include: statistical based approaches, Bayesian belief networks; artificial neural systems; graph theory; knowledge based system technologies; fuzzy theory; hidden markov models; and Dempster-Shafer theory

Objective:  The objective of this BAA is to solve information fusion technology problems rapidly, by developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of identities, behaviors, intentions, capabilitiy, capacity, kinematics, activity level, and saliences.  Examples of key IPB products include: Named Areas of Interest (NAI), Target Areas of Interest (TAI), Courses of Action (COA), Units, Infrastructure Areas (IA), Lines of Communication (LOC), Individuals, NAI Matrices, Target Value Matrices, LOC Matrices, and COA Matrices.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $2.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $250K; FY 08 - $1M; FY 09 - $1M; FY 10 - $650K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 30 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50,000 to $250,000 per year.  There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, in which criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness), and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a top secret and/or secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to top secret and/or secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE FOR REPAIR AND REFURBISHMENT OF C5 TAIL STANDS.  

Dover Air Force Base requires repair and refurbishment of one empennage platform (tail stand) designed to service the tail components of a C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.    

1.  Is refurbishment and modification of this type customarily available in the commercial market?  If not, can the it be modified to fit the requirement or does the requirement need to be modified.  

2.  What type of quality standards are there?

3.  Is there normally contract financing?  What is the standard? 

4.  Methods of contracting for this service, i.e., FFP, time and materials, cost etc.?

5.  Is a quality control plan normally required to be submitted?

6.  What method of surveillance is used by your customers?

7.  What type of performance standards are used to indicate acceptance/unacceptable performance levels?

8.  What type of remedies are used for nonconforming services?

9.  Do you own or have access to large equipment such as cranes for this type of project?

10.  It is anticipated that the painting of the stand will need to be done offsite and possibly sandblasting because of the containment requirement due to the chromium in the paint.  Do you have the facilities for this?

<DESC>This is not a solicitation and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below. This is a Market Survey to identify potential Small Business sources to manufacture and del iver the New Technology Vertical Displacement Gyroscopes (gyros) CN-811 and CN-1314. The configurations of the CN-811 and CN-1314 are identical except the installation requirements: the CN-811 is used in the Army CH-47D Chinook helicopter and the CN-1314 i s used in the Army UH-60A/L Black Hawk helicopter.  The gyros that the Army currently uses employ Spinning Mass Technology.  The Army is interested in suppliers who can provide gyros utilizing New Technology [(e.g. Solid  State, Micro Electro-Mechanical Sy stem (MEMS)].  The intent is to procure a drop-in Form Fit and Function (F3) replacement gyroscope using new technology in place of the spinning mass technology gyroscope without any modification to the helicopters.  Performance Specifications are availabl e for the CN-811 and CN-1314 gyros and will be supplied to any potential manufacturers.  (See below for contact information for specifications or if additional information is required). Requirements for consideration for this contractual effort are as follows: 1) This requirement has interest in businesses under the Small Business Program; 2) suppliers must obtain Interim Safety of Airworthiness Qualification (ISAQ) Certification approval  by the AMCOM Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED), AMSRD-AMR-AE, Bldg 4488 2nd Floor, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5000; and 3) suppliers must certify that the supplier can ultimately receive AMCOM AED full Air Worthiness Release Certification approv al and start delivery of these items around October 2007 .  Supplier capable of manufacturing and delivering these items must so indicate, by writing to Commander, US Army C-E LCMC, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AC, Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5043. The response must include documentation such as Air Worthiness Release Certification (or schedule of this event) for the item(s). This Market Survey does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it guarantee any future contract. No telephone responses will be accepted, only responses in writing or email will be considered. For more information contact Daniel L Corwin,  Daniel.Corwin@us.army.mil.  The deadline for response is 12 January 2007

Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers.

NO EXCEPTIONS OR QUALIFICATIONS.<BR><BR>NEW ONLY.  NO REFURBISHED.  NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the 3M-AIT Passport Reader.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the 3M-AIT Passport Readers to support Consular posts overseas.  3M-AIT Passport Readers have been deployed in all Consular Systems Modernization installations since the inception of the program. Additional units are primarily required at this time to replace any existing AIT PAX readers in need of maintenance, thus extending the life of the VISA Quality Assurance procedure.  The reader was initially selected because the travel document production systems with which it is used required an accurate, reliable instrument to perform quality assurance checks on the OCR zones of visas and passports, thereby validating their machine readability. The reader enables Consulates to generate travel documents that will be accepted and accurately interpreted at any port of entry employing mechanized processing systems. This is of great importance since it eliminates or minimizes incidences of false interpretations of bearer identification data.  Such “mis-reads” can result in the refusal of entry or passage to qualified bearers, impede the processing flows at ports of entry, and otherwise embarrass the U.S. Government.  The AIT reader was selected following a very lengthy market survey and evaluation process.  It was found to be the only device of its type able to meet the Bureau’s specifications.  Features of the unit evaluated are as follows: -Reads International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and non-ICAO compliant documents -Performs quality assurance analysis -Multi-function magnetic stripe reader and OCR -Two RS-232 serial ports and one universal serial bus (USB) port -Remotely upgradeable software -Rugged, no-moving parts design<BR><BR>Due to these factors, the QA modules of travel document production systems were designed around the AIT readers. The selection of any other type or make of reader may put the functionality of overseas visa, passport, and border crossing card systems at risk. Such measures will necessitate the re-engineering of all U.S. travel document issuance systems and will significantly increase the Government’s costs.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested 3M-AIT Passport Readers without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the 3M-AIT Passport Readers because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The 3M-AIT Passport Reader has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the readers soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the 3M-AIT Passport Readers in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for work at the N233 REDS Electrical Renovation. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).   This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  Synopsis: The subject project will renovate the electrical plant in Building N233 including the medium voltage (15KV) building utility feed and switchgear, two 1 MW substations, 480V “building power” distribution, the specialized 480/208V “computer power” distribution system and Emergency Off Controls.  Building N233 is the Ames Central Computing Facility that provides the IT infrastructure services required to day-to-day operation of the Center. The functions provided from this facility include: Financial, HR, Asset Management, Security, and Travel data processing; scientific data processing; Center email and web services; operations of the Center-wide data networks; operation of the Center’s computer security systems; and the interfaces to NASA networks and the Internet. These functions are required on a 24 X 7 basis to support critical Center projects, administrative operations and joint R & D efforts with other NASA Centers. The criticality of these IT systems has resulted in their being designated by the Center and NASA as Mission Essential Infrastructure. Consequently, outages of electrical power must be minimized and the risk of an unplanned outage must be mitigated to the greatest extent possible. The electrical work to be performed under the subject project is, therefore, considered extremely sensitive with respect to the reliability of IT services. In particular, the renovation of the “computer power” system and its integration with specialized Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS) equipment and computer Power Distribution Units (PDUs) is especially complex and sensitive. In addition, the installation of the new Emergency Off Controls will require carefully managed integration and testing with the facility mechanical systems and with the computer power system including the UPS and PDU equipment. Consequently, this project must be performed by a contractor with a demonstrated high degree of expertise and reliability in the disciplines required. Further, the contractor must also have demonstrated skill and success in managing complex computer data center electrical installation projects. Any unplanned outages will be highly disruptive and detrimental to Ames and NASA wide projects as well as joint programs with other agencies such as the FAA. Please make note of the impact of an inadvertent outage is estimated in the range of $110K to $220K per hour in additional program costs that the contractor will be liable for. This would not include the costs incurred due to impact of delays and missed program milestones. These costs would be in addition to the $110K to $220K per hour. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Carol A. Dones no later than 1/10/2007.  Please reference N233 REDS ELECTRICAL RENOVATION in any response.  Mailing address is NASA/Ames Research Center, M/S 213-13, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000.  Note: Make sure your responses are mailed to M/S 213-13 and not M/S 241-1. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Kapow Technologies, 260 Sheridan Ave., Suite 420, Palo Alto, California  94306-2407 for the following requirement: STATEMENT OF WORK TO PROVIDE WEB SERVICES SOFTWARE AND TRAINING FOR HD.GOV

BACKGROUND

Guiding the conservation and wise management of the nation?s coastal resources is a primary function of the federal government?s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms, including collaboration with state and local coastal resource management programs.

The Coastal Services Center (Center) is a division of NOAA located in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Center supports coastal managers and natural resource agencies by facilitating access to and utilization of the most up-to-date technology, information, and management strategies available in the field of coastal resource management.

This support is accomplished as the Center works with state and local programs to resolve site-specific issues.  No  project is undertaken at the Center without a state or local partner.  Over 100 projects are ongoing each year.  The technology created and the lessons learned from these efforts are then transferred to the rest of the nation?s coastal resource managers.  Detailed information on the Center is available at www.csc.noaa.gov.

An emerging need within the coastal management community has been the expressed interest in knowing more about the social, cultural and economic factors of managing our nations coastlines.  Although the information and resources available in this field are limited due to the relative novelty of this field in the coastal arena, there are many non-coastal resources to draw from and a rich opportunity for partnerships and learning from each other to better understand the relationship between people and the coasts.

The Center is working with staff from over 20 federal agencies, 15 universities, and many NGO?s who have programs focusing on the human dimensions of natural resource management to develop HumanDimensions.gov, an interagency web portal focused on the application of social science to natural resource management.  The web portal will include case studies, agency specific information, tools, methodology, policy and legislation, publications, a forum, and more.  This concept will essentially be to support a community of practice for those interested in learning more about social science tools and resources for natural resources.

SCOPE OF WORK

The purpose of this procurement is to assist the Center in developing HumanDimensions.gov (HD.gov).  Specifically, the contractor will provide software for the Web portal, providing training of the software for Center staff, and demonstrate the software to HD.gov partners.  The software must extract, and integrate appropriate Web site content from partner agencies onto HD.gov.  Software must be capable of extracting content in multiple formats including:  text, charts, and photographs.  Software must be able to extract Web-based tools and applications from partner Web sites and post to HD.gov.  Additionally software must be able to apply results from one application to a secondary or tertiary application.

REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor must have expertise in software development, focusing on Web site content transfer, data integration, and the sequential co-dependent utilization of Web based applications.  Additionally, the contractor must have the ability to demonstrate their product to audiences with wide ranging backgrounds and technical experience.  Excellent communication skills, both written and oral, are required.

TASKS

This task requires the contractor to provide training, presentations, and software for the application of Web services to partner agencies.  This contract is divided into three parts, a base and two options.  The base task includes providing the demonstration software and training to Center staff.  If the Center decides that the software will meet their needs, then Option 1 task will be exercised, where the other federal partners are introduced to the software.  If the partners deem the software is acceptable to meet their needs, then Option 2 task will be exercised, where the application is made available via a web-based server.  Specific contractor responsibilities include:
1.	Provide demonstration software and subsequent four-day training for up to twelve participants at the Center for the use of software.
2.	Provide web services software to an individual workstation for the development of demonstrations for partner agencies.
3.	Demonstrate the structure and functionality of the software to partner agencies at workshop.
4.	Provide components that permit multiple users working from a server-based application of the software.
5.	Provide technical support as needed for one year.

TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall make at least on trip to the Center and one trip to a workshop in Washington, DC.  The Contractor shall make independent travel arrangements and pay for any travel costs associated with the contract in accordance with federal travel regulations.  No invitations travel will be issued to the Contractor.

Items to be delivered to NOAA Coastal Services Center, 2234 South Hobson Ave.,  Charleston, SC  29405.  In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The FSC for this is 7030 and the NAICS Code is 518112, small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  Kapow Technologies is the only known source capable of providing the required web service.  The technical requirements of this project require software capable of enterprise level integration of text, graphic content, and front-end data collection from multiple web sites.  Front-end data collection means the software interacts with the publicly available portion of websites to extract information.  This functionality allows HD.gov to rebuild databases from a multitude of sources, without infringing into protected information behind a website?s firewall.  Software must be able to extract web-based tools and applications from partner websites and post to HD.gov.  Additionally software must be able to apply results from one application to a secondary or tertiary application.  This software product will be used by partners, and therefore must be easy to use with scalable capabilities to match the user?s technical level.  Kapow Technology is qualified to meet the requirements for website scraping, content integration, front-end data collection, and is uniquely qualified to provide a user-friendly product available to partners with wide ranging technical backgrounds.  The Kapow Web Integration Platform 6.1 format allows less technical users to easily to comfortable leverage the functionality of the program; while more advanced users are able to produce very specialized technical products.  Because HD.gov is a large collaboration with very different partners, the need to provide a user-frendly format iwht wide ranging capabilities is the most stringent requirement of this contract.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. January 3, 2007 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required Web Service.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The Market Survey W15QKN-06-X-0854 posted on 12/08/2005 is replaced with W15QKN-07-X-0307. Future information will be released under W15QKN-07-X-0307. The Market Survey is amended to change the number and update the following: MARKET SURVEY- EXCALIBUR BLOCK 1b SD&D ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a 48 or less month SD&D effort beginning in 2007 for the Block 1b objective unitary warhead variant of the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€, a precision guided, extended range 155mm artillery projectile. The Excalibur is a Precision-Guided, 155mm projectile capable of delivering precise, lethal, cost effective fires at ranges of up to 35 km and greater. The Block I Excalibur is an international cooperative development program with the Kingdom of Sweden. The 155mm Excalibur projectile will enable the maneuver commander to precisely defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral damage and unexploded ordnance. Excalibur performance will be largely dependant upon accurate target locating systems and sensors. This program supports the requirements of the US Army. It is being pursued through an incremental development approach with time-phased improvements of performance capabilities. The first unitary warhead, Block Ia-1, began production in FY05 and is currently in production. The Block 1b objective unitary warhead variant will be a lower cost alternative to the Block Ia projectile with equivalent or improved accuracy, range, lethality, and increased reliability requirements. The draft performance specification is being developed (PRF 12999871) which is posted as attachment 1 for your review and comment in response to this market survey. All responses to this market survey are required to be English. The program intends to host an industry day in February 2007, formal notification will be posted through PROCNET. To be considered, all interested sources must provide requested information and data in response to the following: a. Provide a detailed description of your system to include physical characteristic length (must be under 1 meter), weight (must not exceed 106 pounds) and guidance concept. b. Provide evidence of US Government-approved (POP certified) protective container for shipment of the round. c. Provide evidence of meeting the following Performance Parameters â€“ this information is also addressed in the DRAFT Performance specification as well: 1. Accuracy: Less than or equal to 10m Circular Error Probability 2. Range: Maximum 35 km threshold, 40 km â€“ objective, Minimum range of 8 km â€“ threshold, 3km â€“ objective 3. Reliability: Greater than or equal to 90% - threshold, greater than or equal to 96% objective. 4.  Effectiveness:  Greater than or equal to the effectiveness of the M107 155mm artillery projectile. 5. Effects after penetration: 4 inch concrete penetration â€“ threshold, 8 inch â€“ objective 6. Accuracy with GPS jamming 30m CEP - threshold and 20m CEP â€“ objective 7. Interoperability with the Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) â€“ the EPIAFS Interface Control Document is attachment 2. 8. It is a strong desire of the Army to make use of capacitor base data hold power supply concepts to maximize the number of pre-fire sets. 9. The Block I Excalibur is an international cooperative development program with the Kingdom of Sweden. The program desires to maximize international interoperability such as with the Swedish 52-caliber Archer 155mm Howitzer system.  Current unique Swedish Requirements identified in the DRAFT Performance specification address in-flight retargeting, incorporation of semi- active laser terminal guidance, and a maximum range requirement of 50 km threshold, 60 km - objective (52 cal guns),. Section 1.1 identifies that Sections 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 represent uniquely Swedish requirements.  The program requires responses related to these requirements to be identified as a segregated, yet exercisable option. d. Identify the need for any waivers or deviations from the performance specification for final tactical configuration production representative deliveries anticipated in FY10 / FY11. e. Does a complete technical data package exist for your round? f. Provide rough order magnitude estimated price per projectile in U.S.dollars for annual production quantities based on assumptions for $60M of annual production funding amount for a 10 year period. Provide a likely production delivery schedule, to include a production qualification build and test period.  The objective average unit production cost is less than $25,000/projectile. g. Provide a breakout of major subsystems and other costs that total to the average unit production costs h. Address the following seven topics regarding any possible on-going development being conducted under your control: 1. Describe the current state of development or production of your concept. 2. What capabilities can be demonstrated through gun fire testing at the end of Demonstration Phase (approximately 15 Months duration).  What level of maturity could the contractor demonstrate â€“ and under what conditions (i.e. QTY of rounds, pre-fire conditioning, zone of firingâ€¦) 3. What is your intended maximum rate / capacity of production using current or future facilities? 4. Provide evidence of capability of current production line for this or a similar munitions. If current production lines are not capable of production/delivery of estimated quantities for the answer to above item g., provide list of facilitization required with estimated price. 5. Provide evidence of ability to meet the specifications and quantity. 6. Provide evidence of in-process development and testing to ensure item quality in a gun-hardened environment. 7. Provide evidence of Production Readiness Reviews (using the Willoughby template, reference DoD 4245.7-M) conducted at your facility for similar munitions. SDD is expected to be 48 months or less.  The Government intends to make multiple awards of the Block 1b SDD effort via Full and Open Competition. The SDD effort will include a base award with two options.  The two phases will be the base System Design/Maturity Demonstration Phase (15-18 months) and the Design Refinement/Qualification Phase.  The Design Refinement/Qualification Phase will be structured as two contract options with periods of 12-15 months each.  More than likely there will be a down select to one contractor at the end of phase I.  The Government requests feedback on this phased approach. Each development phase will conclude with an evaluation of performance to determine whether or not an awardee can continue to the next phase.  Options for LRIP will also be included in the formal RFP. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Priced contract for all phases; however the Government will entertain contractor input on contract type by phase.  Initial awards will be for the Demonstration Phase only.  Participation in the follow on phases will be contract options to be exercised based on successful performance in the end of phase tests. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at a no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. Interested sources should submit their qualification data and requested information not later than 1300 hrs EST on 31 January 2007 to JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, ATTN: Wendy Lopez, email: wlopez@pica.army.mil, telephone: 973-724-3066.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of Intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Re-refining Used Petroleum Lubricating Oils (MIL-PRF-2104, Type 10W, Type 15W40, Type 30W and Type 40W)
<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of Intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Re-refining Used Petroleum Lubricating Oils (MIL-PRF-2104, Type 10W; Type 15W40; Type 30W; and Type 40W).
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Re-refining Used Petroleum Lubricating Oils (MIL-PRF-2104, Type 10W; Type 15W40; Type 30W; and Type 40W).
According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Sarah Ayers, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Sarah Ayers, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-6413; by FAX at (202) 205-6390; or by email at sarah.ayers@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Re-refining Used Petroleum Lubricating Oils (MIL-PRF-2104, Type 10W; Type 15W40; Type 30W; and Type 40W). North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 324191. 
    The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<SUBJECT>R -- Issues in the Georgian Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
<DESC>The water utilities sector in Georgia is in crisis, stemming from inadequate water utility management, a weak policy environment, and insufficient investments.  Service is intermittent, and in many cases water supplies are unsafe for human consumption. Contamination and water-borne disease rates are disturbing and could be rapidly reaching a tipping point. The country's wastewater treatment plants are not operational, save for partial treatment in Tbilisi. The condition of water and sewerage networks is deteriorating from lack of funds for maintenance and replacement. Cost recovery is below 30 percent, foretelling serious financial problems in the sector. Local governments are not implementing adequate tariff policies and are forced to make up a large portion of the huge operating losses of their water utilities. Despite subsidies, practically all water utilities in the country continue to decline. 
Failure to address the water utilities sectors serious degeneration in Georgia is likely to:
Undermine public confidence in both national and local governments;
Accelerate declining public health and water quality;
Exhaust local government fiscal resources; 
Burden families with the additional cost of obtaining water and sanitation from alternative sources; and
Disrupt reforms in the electricity sector, due to the inability of water utilities to pay their electricity bills.
USAID, in partnership with the Government of Georgia and various donors and lenders, is contemplating how best to address these problems.  A contract or an assistance agreement awarded through full and open competition is being considered for implementing USAIDs activity, once the final design is completed. Potential offerors and implementers are therefore being given the opportunity to provide their perspective and suggest specific interventions that would provide the greatest beneficial impact and be the most cost-effective.  Voluntary submissions are requested by January 15 and should be no more than ten pages.  
USAID may initiate a competitive procurement that could incorporate information and recommendations submitted in response to this request.  However, there is no commitment that this will occur or that USAID will use any material submitted. All submissions will become the property of the US Government and no compensation will be provided. Information and recommendations provided in response to this request will not be considered as design work and will not create a conflict of interest regarding subsequent implementation. Any organization or individual that responds will not gain advantage or be disadvantaged by the quantity or quality of the submission or decision not to respond to this request.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information- Contracting for the Operation and Maintenance of Iowa and Milan Army Ammunition Plants (Reference Solicitation Number W52P1J-06-R-0201)
<DESC>Request for Information  Contracting for the Operation and Maintenance of Iowa and Milan Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs). PURPOSE: The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, which includes the U.S. Army, PEO Ammunition and Joint Munitions Command, has a continuing requirement for a contractor(s) to operate and maintain the following two Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) facilities: §	Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP) located in Middletown, IA, and  §	Milan Army Ammunition Plant (MLAAP) located in Milan, TN.   We are seeking information that may assist us in the formation of a final acquisition strategy.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is being issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals  (RFP).  This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service.  We reserve the right to accept, reject, or use without obligation or compensation any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. OBJECTIVES: In addition to maintaining various critical capabilities at the facilities, the Government desires to implement an Acquisition Strategy that achieves the following short- and long-term objectives: 1.	Provide continuous, effective, safe operation and maintenance of Iowa and Milan AAPs.  2.	Create an efficient operation that allows the operating contractor(s) to successfully compete for business in the open market (ammunition or otherwise) without the guarantee of product from the Government. 3.	Minimize the total cost to the Army (O&M, product, PBS, modernization) by increasing the efficiency of facility operations.       4.   Provide a seamless transition from the current facilities use contract to future facilities use contracts to facilitate the production of conventional ammunition for any/all future requirements. 5.  Provide increased transparency into O&M costs and the relative impact on ammunition pricing.       6.  Maintain maximum flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. BACKGROUND/GENERAL INFORMATION: American Ordnance LLC (AO) has operated and maintained IAAAP and MLAAP since October 1998 under one, no cost, facilities use contract which will expire 31 Dec 2008.  Benefits to the operating contractor include: §	The right to use Government owned assets (property, buildings, equipment) to generate revenue.  §	The right to bring in tenants via the ARMS program to generate revenue and help offset the cost of operation. §	The Government will provide some initial limited workload, as well as the potential for directed work when justified under a CICA exception. §	The Government will fix and/or modernize the Government-owned assets upon receipt, review, approval, and funding of the operating contractors recommendations.  The Government will identify potentially available funds (BRAC, etc).  In consideration for the exclusive use of the facilities, the operating contractor complies with the operational plans for base support.  Base support tasks typically include: §	Maintenance: Real property and grounds maintenance and management. §	Property: Maintenance and management of Government property, to include buildings, structures, roads, bridges, grounds, railroad equipment & facilities, vehicles, equipment, and utility systems. §	Security/Force Protection:  Providing a security program for the protection of the people, facility, and its arms, ammunition, and explosives. §	Safety: Providing a safety program which protects the lives and health of employees (both Government and contractor), the public, and the facility, including lessees and subcontractors. §	Fire Protection: Establish capabilities needed to protect employees and property against fires, hazardous material spills, etc. §	Environmental: Ensuring the necessary environment al and hazardous material permits issued in the name of the operating contractor; the Government is responsible for environmental restoration, and the operating contractor is responsible for everything else, such as compliance with Federal and State mandat ed environmental programs and pollution prevention activities. For additional information including draft scopes of work outlining each of the major areas of base support your attention is directed to: http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm . These draft scopes of work are currently undergoing thorough review by the government to assure their contents clearly and accurately reflect the Governments requirements. Other services are separately funded under a companion contract (often on a fixed-price basis; however, time and materials or other terms and conditions can be used). Such services include: §	Tenant Support §	ACO Support §	Specialized Testing §	Production Base Support §	Project Work, to include disposal activities and installation restoration §	Execution of special programs for forestry, agriculture, fish, and wildlife programs §	Commercial Reuse Efforts §	Material Management Efforts §	Planning for emergency demands in the event of a national emergency §	BRAC transition project efforts. The mission of these facilities is the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) of finished ammunition product in support of DOD training and war-fighting requirements.  In order to fulfill this mission, these LAP facilities must possess sufficient expertise, capabil ity and capacity to provide manufacturing core capabilities consisting of melt-pour, the pressing of precision missile warheads, and the ability to LAP 120mm training and tactical tank rounds at IAAAP, and mortar melt-pour as well as C-4 extrusion, and hig h-speed loading of high explosive 40mm rounds at MLAAP. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS):  Numerous ARMS agreements are currently in place at each facility.  New Operating Contractor(s) (NOC(s)) will be required to retain and manage any ARMS Agreements in place at the time of the new Facilities Use contract award. Transition from Current Operating Contractor to NOC(s): Potential Encumbrances:  Both facilities may have production lines encumbered by the current operating contractor through 31 Dec 2012 (depending on the outcome of product solicitations currently in competition and other potential future product awards).  T he current operating contractor can elect one or both of the following if they are not the successful offeror under the new Facilities Use contract: §	Negotiate an assignment of any then-ongoing production contracts with the NOC(s) - OR - §	Make appropriate payments to the NOC(s) for services provided to them as long as they remain the prime contractor under such production contracts.  Anticipated services which would be purchased from the NOC(s) include:  material handling/storage, technic al support, administrative, safety, security, and environmental. Total payments for 2009 are currently estimated at $30M for the services listed at:  http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm . It will be up to the NOC(s) to negotiate the appropriate amount of rent from the current operating contractor for the services provided in the outyears. Intellectual Property/Contractor-Owned Equipment: Whether in the near term or at the end of the current production contracts, the transition from the current operating contractor to NOC(s) also poses challenges in the areas of intellectual property and con tractor-owned equipment.  The current operating contractor may retain ownership of some proprietary production process information as well as some pieces of production equipment.  Due to the complexity of ownership and intellectual property issues, it appe ars these may best be resolved by making use of industrys expertise and assistance. Productio n Contracts: The Government does not intend to guarantee product with this acquisition, but it is considering the acquisition of some product at the time of award.  Specific quantities, terms, and conditions relative to such product are yet to be determined. However, i tems under consideration include M112 demo charge, MICLIC, 40 lb Cratering Charge, and M107 and 75mm/105mm Blanks.  The 40mm LAP is also directed to MLAAP through at least 2009 (via systems contracts).  Refer to Transition from Current Operating Contracto r to NOC(s) above for potential NOC(s) constraints in assuming such production. PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRATEGY: The U.S. Army, PEO Ammunition, and Joint Munitions Command propose the following: Issue one solicitation with the Government reserving the right to award one Facilities Use contract covering both facilities or two separate contracts (one for IAAAP, one for MLAAP), twenty-five years in length.   The Government contemplates a 25-year performance period for the contract to allow the contractor to plan for an optimum return on investments in an efficient, modern plant.  Periodically (proposed as every five years) the Government and contractor may rev iew the contract to incorporate changes necessitated by changes in Government policy, budgets, and the operating environment.  In addition, the Government may include periodic award term evaluations (proposed as every five years) to review contractor per formance with the Government option whether to extend the period of performance to the full 25 years. Potential offerors will have the opportunity to compete for one or both of the facilities but are not required to bid on both. Prospective offerors will provide technical proposals for the following: a. Operate & Maintain the Facility: Prospective offerors will be required to identify their proposed business and management approach to operating and maintaining the facility.  Offerors will be required to provide a Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS)  to accomplish the objectives set forth in Statements of Objectives for each of the identified base support tasks.  The PBWS will become part of the contract and the contractor will be required to perform these objectives through the implementation of thes e documents. b. Optimization Plan: Prospective offerors will be required to identify their plan(s) (one for Iowa, one for Milan, and/or both) for minimizing the total cost of operations to the Army (O&M, product, PBS, modernization) throughout the life of the contract.  Included might be such recommendations as modification and/or reduction/reconfiguration of facility footprint, infrastructure improvements, facility modernization, etc. c. Prospective offerors will also be required to demonstrate financial capability as well as a legal ability to assume ammunition related responsibilities. The Government will evaluate the proposals and make a best value source selection decision as to whether it is in our best interest to award one or two, twenty five year facilities use contract(s).  It is estimated that beginning no later than 01 Jan 09, the NOC(s) will assume the contractual duties as facilities use contractor(s). Supply and additional service requirements will be purchased through a companion contract(s) to the facilities use contract.  INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY: In responding to this RFI, potentially interested parties are asked to submit information on the following: 1.	Briefly describe your company, products, services, history, ownership and any other information you deem relevant.  In particular, describe any contracts you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including m anagement and operations approach, ability to assume ammunition related responsibilities, financial capability, security requirements, and any relevant lessons learned 2.	Suggest or comment on the Armys proposed acquisition stra tegy as outlined above, relative to the stated objectives   3.	Identify potential risks associated with the Armys proposed acquisition strategy, along with possible methods of mitigation 4.	Assess the likelihood of the Government achieving its objectives; also assess the likelihood of the Government achieving zero cost 5.	Assess the impact of the transition period on this acquisition  6.  Provide recommendations on any preferred alternative strategy(s) that is capable of achieving the Armys aforementioned objectives for the proposed acquisition        7.  What, if any, incentives are needed to interest you in this facilities use contract.        8.  Provide comments/recommendations on the proposed period of performance, periodic review of the contract, and award term provisions.        9. Provide comments on the draft scopes of work posted at the following Website; specifically, feedback on requirements contained within those documents which would not be applicable in a purely commercial ammunition production facility:   http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/iowamilan/index.htm . GENERAL INFORMATION: Responses: Responses to this RFI are due NLT 31 Jan 07. Responses should be submitted to:  Ms. Cindy Peterman,                                                           Army Sustainment Command                                                           ATTN:  AMSAS-ACA-L                                                           Rock Island, IL  61299-6000 One-on-One Discussions: It is the Governments intent to hold one-on-one discussions with respondents to this RFI sometime in Feb 07.  Any information provided to the Government during one-on-one discussions will be treated as proprietary upon your request to treat it as such.  Proprietary information discussed at the one-on-ones will not be included in a draft or formal Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Government intends to use RFI responses and feedback from one-on-one sessions with RFI respondents to help finalize our acquis ition strategy, to be followed by issuance of a draft RFP.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<CONTACT>Michele V Waters Contract Specialist 907-257-6945
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK The purpose of this document is to identify Alaska Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and Regional Offices (AVAHSRO) requirements to procure the professional services of "value-based leadership" education, training, and consultative services.  Key Issues: *The organization's Governing Board has never attended leadership training, either individually or as a group, to enhance efficiency and operation of organizational governance.  In order to meet the intended Purpose and Function of the Governing Board, as outlined in local policy and directive, such training is indicated.  *To infuse the same "leadership training mindsets" in subordinate level leadership and to allow for the evolving nature of this type of consultancy, associated training for Service Chiefs is indicated. *Past AVAHSRO facilitators have not possessed the competencies necessary to conduct this type of training. * AVAHSRO requires a vendor with direct healthcare experience, an understanding of rural healthcare issues, and demonstrated experience working with healthcare organizations within the state of Alaska. Vendor must have an established curriculum that is tailored to the healthcare environment, and that also brings a focus on not just professional skills, but also personal skills that are essential for being a caregiver, manager, support service worker. * Vendor's services must ensure integration of "value-based leadership" into AVAHSRO's culture with measurable effects.      Current Situation: Governing Board (GB) members are generally solid contributors in their individual areas of responsibility. However, the complex nature of the organization and the eclectic background and experience of Governing Board members presents roadblocks to governance progress.  It is envisioned this team can perform at a level of innovation in leadership that is greater than the simple sum of sufficient individual actions. Leadership training is indicated to bring this eclectic 8-member staff to its "next level" of leadership.  The training will assist GB members to assess themselves and their values, see how personal values interact or conflict with the values of others in the work environment, and provide methods/approaches to address roadblocks - allowing leadership and the organization to reach the next level of operational performance. Identified Requirement: The three-phased approach below outlines AVAHSRO's requirement for initial "values-based leadership" consultative services.  Because of the dynamic nature of interpersonal relationships, especially in professional roles and functions, it is anticipated this course of work will evolve over time.    I.  Phase I:  Organization Familiarization:  Vendor will: A.  Off-site Preparation:  Preview pertinent AVHASRO documentation which consists of; Executive Leadership Biographies, the organizations previous Strategic Plan, the current Strategic Plan, and the organizations Mission, Vision and Goals, prior to arrival in Alaska. Vendor will help focus documentation required based on subject matter expertise. B.  On-site:  Arrive in Alaska for initial five day session.  NOTE: Subsequent services and frequency to be determined after organizational familiarization (phase I) and initial education (phase II) are complete. 1)  Vendor will perform analysis to determine organization's current framework, focus and direction. 2)  Assess current atmosphere and behaviors of AVAHSRO leadership: Governing Board and Service Chiefs. 3)  Determine profiles of the AVAHSRO leadership - professional strengths, individual challenges, team contributions and liabilities, etc. 4)  Assess interaction dynamics among team members-functional and dysfunctional? 5)  Identify leadership's vision for future, envisioned changes. 6)  Assess AVAHSRO's previous interventions/actions attempted: successful/unsuccessful. C.  Required Service Dates:  The availability of staff at AVAHSRO for any training opportunity is hard to predict.  Therefore the following dates are provided as the most opportune times to achieve the maximum benefit for all staff: April 16-20, 2007 April 30 - May 4, 2007 May 14-18, 2007      II.   Phase II:  Introductory Education:  Provide initial orientation education on "values-based leadership to all levels of AVAHSRO staff. Expectation of AVAHSRO is that vendor will present education &amp; training sessions, as well as, provide necessary resources/tools for AVAHSRO to be able to incorporate "values-based leadership" into the organization using a train-the-trainer program. A.  Session 1:  Provide educational forum/presentation on "values-based leadership" focused on executive leadership (i.e. Governing Body of AVAHSRO).   Session 2:  Provide educational forum/presentation on "values-based leadership" focused on AVAHSRO Service chiefs (approximately 23, mid-level managers). C.  Session 3:  Provide educational forum/presentation on "values-based leadership" targeted to general AVAHSRO staff (approximately 400) on values-based leadership.  Session should be offered several times a day over several days to allow for maximum attendance by all.   III.  Phase III:  Proposed Course of Action/Subsequent Services:  Vendor in collaboration with AVAHSRO leadership will:   Provide AVAHSRO Director a proposed plan of action for subsequent training/direction to include; Suggested training/education needed to continue progression Frequency of interactions with staff, and details as to which staff these interactions should be with. Idendification of tools that will assist AVAHSRO to "infuse" value-based leadership into the organization Identify measures to evaluate the effectiveness of "value-based leadership" implementation within AVAHSRO.
