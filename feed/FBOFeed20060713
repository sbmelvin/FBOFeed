<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) Marathon is excited to be celebrating its 10th Anniversary.  The USAF Marathon is held at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio and is open to the public.  The marathon has built a remarkable reputation for its outstanding closed course, organization, exposition, post-race festival and customer service.  In 2005 we were awarded the official status as the only sanctioned marathon in the U.S. Air Force making it an important, high profile event with senior leadership involvement.  With that in mind, the USAF Marathon staff is constantly striving to develop and expand the event and to anticipate the needs of our participants, sponsors and community.  This year our goal is to expand runner participation to 10,000 runners and to expand all of the events surrounding the marathon to give our sponsors the highest featured visibility. 

	Last year our runners represented 50 states and 8 foreign countries with a total of about 10,000 people attending the post-race festival. This gives our sponsors a unique opportunity to connect with a large and global market.  This year’s race will be on Saturday, September 16, 2006 with a two day Sports and Fitness Exposition on September 14-15, Gourmet Pasta Dinner on the eve of the race and a Post-Race Festival at the finish line. Also this year, the A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog" will be highlighted as the featured Air Force Aircraft.   

	Currently we’re seeking sponsors to participate in the many different events that are all part of the USAF Marathon. The USAF Marathon offers various levels of sponsorship including category exclusivity, signage, sampling opportunities, two day expo, gourmet pasta dinner, post-race festival, race-course hospitality stations and logo opportunities.

	Our professional staff is committed to helping your company achieve the maximum return on your investment. I would love the opportunity to speak with you and discuss some of your marketing goals, budgets and plans.  We can discuss ways in which the USAF Marathon can meet your company’s strategies.  Please don’t hesitate to call me with any comments, questions or concerns about the USAF Marathon and/or your participation in it.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Quinault National Fish Hatchery needs nine (9) fiberglass rearing tanks which will be installed on the south side of the present nursery building.  Mass marking projets require temporary holding tanks to verify tagging efficacy.  The new tanks need a similar design to the ones currently in the hatchery building.  The construction material should be smooth, non-porous, low maintenance and not require painting on both / either the inside and outside surfaces.  Past performance using tanks constructed of plastic / fiberglass have met expectations for durability, rearing healthy fish and ease of maintenance.  A Forest green color is preferred.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical capability of the item offered to meet the government's requirement, past performance/experience with similar requirements and price.  Technical capability, past performance/experience, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

<SOLNBR>101816Q463
<RESPDATE>072206
<ARCHDATE>07132007
<CONTACT>Cheryl Mockford Contracting Officer 5032312394     cheryl_mockford@fws.gov;
<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK TERN ISLAND ELECTRICAL AND PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM EVALUATIONS AND REPAIRS There are several goals to be tackled with this project. 1.	Evaluate efficiency and condition of current photovoltaic system and associated components at Tern Island. 2.	Make adjustments to said photovoltaic system to ensure best efficiency. 3.	Conduct training of FWS employees on operation and maintenance (verbal and written training) of said photovoltaic system. 4.	Evaluate Tern Island electrical wiring and all associated components to see if it is installed according to National Electrical Code Standards. 5.	Make recommendations as needed to bring any electrical wiring or associated components up to National Electrical Code Standards. 6.	Conduct repairs as needed to bring any electrical wiring or associated components up to National Electrical Code Standards. This is a two-stage approach to the evaluation and maintenance of the photovoltaic and electrical systems at Tern Island.  This will require 2 separate trips to Tern Island.  FWS would like for bids to be provided accordingly because there is not currently enough substantiated information to be able to accurately upgrade the entire Tern Island electrical system. Therefore, we are proposing to obtain more detailed information during the first phase of the effort, which would enable contractors to intelligently execute the second portion of the work. During the first stage, the contractor will complete the following tasks: 1. Travel to and from a staging point in Honolulu, Hawaii. (Transportation from Hawaii to Tern Island and back is to be provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)) 2. Evaluate the general condition of the existing PV arrays, batteries, inverters and charge controllers. 3. Perform a complete routine maintenance interval on the Photovoltaic Power system which would cover the following: 1. Maintenance of the flooded battery bank including: Performing an equalize charge, recording specific gravity values, post equalization watering of cells, record cell voltages, battery cleaning, torque terminals document all findings 2. AGM battery maintenance tasks would include: Torque all terminals, battery cleaning as needed record cell voltages, document all findings 3. Array maintenance would consist of: Checking mechanical fasteners, inspect all wiring, torque combiner box terminations measure ISC on various module groups measured VOC on various module groups document all findings 4. Inverter maintenance would be comprised of: Developing operating parameters on current system requirements, program inverters, verify proper inverter operation, print and install program and operational labels, document all findings. 5. Charge Regulator maintenance would entail: Develop set point parameters, calibrate controllers, verify operation, and document all findings 6. Develop a final report, which would summarize all findings and include recommendations for future practices and maintenance upon return home from Tern Island. 4. Identify any electrical system components that require specific tests or enhancements to improve their future reliability or performance. 5. Review, refine and further develop the Standard Operating Procedures for the PV system. 6. Provide training for the island staff on then operation of the PV system and its various components 7. Inventory and document the existing electrical system to develop schematic diagrams for it. 8. Develop a comprehensive list of circuit and component upgrades for the island electrical system. During the second stage, the contractor would implement system upgrades based on information and documentation gathered during the initial stage. This would include the following: 1. Establish the scope of prioritized upgrades based on information gathered during the initial stage, and discussions with the appropriate USFWS staff. 2. Provide 3 days of combined engineering and drafting services to develop drawings and materials lists detailing implementation of specified upgrades 3. Travel to and from a staging point in Honolulu, Hawaii. (Transportation from Hawaii to Tern Island and back is to be provided by the USFWS) 4. Undertake any specific on site testing or electrical equipment enhancements on previously identified components of the electrical system. (Engine Generator generally excluded) 5. Provide labor to implement electrical circuit upgrades at the Tern Island facility.  The contractor will provide approximately 2 weeks of electrical crew labor. 6. Train the Tern Island staff on an enhanced set of Standard Operating Procedures 7. Implement a standard documentation plan for data acquisition for the electrical system with the Island staff. 8. Obtain information to complete a set of as-built electrical drawings on the upgraded portion of the electrical system. 9. Provide written recommendations for future upgrades or maintenance actions pertinent to the operation of the electrical system upon return home from Tern Island. All meals and lodging for contractor staff will be provided by the USFWS while working on Tern Island. This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on technical capability of the item offered to meet the government's requirement, past performance/experience with similar requirements and price.  Technical capability, past performance/experience, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

<RESPDATE>060106
<CONTACT>Harrison Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-2314, Email harrison.smith@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been tasked to ensure that the United States remains safe from attack by the illicit importation, development, or procurement of a nuclear or radiological device.  In recognition of the catastrophic risk posed by the use of a nuclear weapon within the United States, DHS has integrated all nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support into a single office: the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.  The DNDO will develop the global nuclear detection architecture; conduct research and development; and acquire and support the deployment of the domestic nuclear detection system.
The DNDO established the Office of Transformational Research and Development (OTR&D) to conduct, support, coordinate, and encourage an aggressive transformational program of Research and Development (R&D) that will dramatically improve national capabilities to detect and report attempts to import or transport a nuclear device, Special Nuclear Material (SNM), or radiological materials intended for illicit use.
Towards this end, OTR&D is conducting an aggressive program of exploratory research to make significant advances in basic detection technology and to reduce the costs and manpower required.  Priority is placed on R&D that has the greatest enabling potential for filling the capability gaps in the nuclear detection architecture.  Transformational R&D will undertake those efforts that dramatically improve system performance and reduce technical, performance and/or cost risks in achieving DNDO objectives by bringing innovative new concepts to a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration before transitioning them to a more advanced technology demonstration or a final commercial system development phase.
DNDO is soliciting proposals under the attached Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Transformational Research and Development in Nuclear Detection Technology that directly supports the DNDO mission.  Specifically, this BAA solicits proposals in the following areas of Exploratory Research (ER): Innovative Detection Materials, Innovative Detection Techniques, Advanced Special Nuclear Material (SNM) Interrogation and Verification, and Algorithm Development.  The Government encourages participation from private industry, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations.  The submission deadline for (optional) white papers is March 30, 2006, and for full technical and cost proposals is June 1, 2006.

<CONTACT>Colleen Elliott, Contract Specialist, Phone (915) 832-4714, Fax (915) 832-4192, Email colleenelliott@ibwc.state.gov
<DESC>The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) intends to acquire on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition water quality sampling, sediment sampling, benthic monitoring, and fish monitoring for the wastewater discharge to the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall in San Diego, San Diego County, California.  Laboratory services, data interpretation, trend analyses, as well as reporting for the sampling and monitoring program will be required.  This is a Notice of Intent to award a firm fixed-price contract for the above services to The City of San Diego, 600 B Street, San Diego, California 92101-4587, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-7, Public Interest.  In September 1997, the International Boundary and Water Commission constructed an International Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) in the City of San Diego, California to serve the city of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  This treatment plant was constructed under United States and Mexico Commission Minute No. 283, and is operated under the clauses contained in Commission Minute 296.  The IWTP receives and treats raw wastewater generated by the City of Tijuana, and discharges the treated effluent into the Pacific Ocean through a land Outfall pipeline, and Ocean Outfall.  The IWTP is operated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit No. 96-50, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.  Identified within the NPDES permit is a Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program for the receiving waters of the IWTP effluent which extends north and south over an area in the vicinity of the discharge point for the Ocean Outfall.  The requirements for the description of services of this document originate from the NPDES permit requirements for the IWTP.  In July 1990, the USIBWC entered into an agreement with the City of San Diego for sharing of design and construction costs of the South Bay Land Outfall.  Also, as part of this agreement, the USIBWC and the City of San Diego agreed to a 50/50 share in the ownership of the Land Outfall after completion of construction.  In January 1995, the USIBWC entered into an agreement with the City of San Diego for sharing of design and construction costs of the South Bay Ocean Outfall.  As part of this agreement, the USIBWC and the City of San Diego agreed to share in the ownership of the Ocean Outfall.  The ownership share of the Ocean Outfall is 0.3994 for the City of San Diego, and 0.6606 for the USIBWC.  The City of San Diego participated in the cost sharing of the Land and Ocean Outfalls to be able to use these facilities for their future South Bay Reclamation Treatment Plant.  The City’s South Bay Reclamation Plant was completed on May 6, 2002, and the City is discharging treated effluent through the South Bay Land Outfall and the South Bay Ocean Outfall to the Pacific Ocean.  The effluent from the two wastewater treatment plants, the ITWTP and the City Reclamation Plant, is combined and is indistinguishable after discharge into the Pacific Ocean.  The City of San Diego South Bay Reclamation Plant is operated under a NPDES discharge permit similar to the NPDES permit issued for the ITWP.  In recognition of the same discharge point for the combined effluent of the two treatment plants, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board has issued the city of San Diego a NPDES permit with a similar, and in many cases, identical, Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Program to that of the IWTP NPDES permit.  The City of San Diego currently operates an advanced primary wastewater treatment facility at Pt Loma, and the South Bay Reclamation wastewater facility within the City of San Diego.  Both treatment plants are operated under NPDES permits issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board and require Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Programs.  The City of San Diego has been conducting this sampling, monitoring and reporting program for many years, using their own equipment, resources, and staff.  Since the City of San Diego will be performing the Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Program for their own South Bay Reclamation Plant at many of the identical monitoring stations for the IWTP, the City of San Diego has expressed a willingness to cost share these two programs.  Significant savings to the federal government and the City of San Diego will be realized by sharing the two programs.  However, it is only if the City of San Diego is allowed to perform the work involved in the program, as the City does not intend to bid their portion of the work out, and will not share in the costs if the government solicits for a Contractor.  Savings to be realized will be on costs of performing the one and off shore sampling, analysis of samples and data obtained, documentation and forms required, and in maintaining the database of results.  In addition, since the City of San Diego has on staff trained technical personnel capable of interpreting monitoring data and laboratory results, the federal government will benefit by having access to these personnel and not having to hire occasional consultants for the interpretation of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant data.  In recognition of the co-ownership of the land and ocean outfall facilities, and the substantial savings to both the City of San Diego and the federal government for sharing of the Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Programs; it is in the public interest for the USIBWC and the City of San Diego to enter into a contract for the receiving water sampling, monitoring, analysis and reporting service for the IWTP.  The resultant contract will be for a basic period commencing October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, with four one-year option periods.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source.  There is no solicitation document available.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any and all proposals received by 10:00 a.m. local time on July 28, 2006 will be considered by the Government.  Assertion of capability to provide the required service must be submitted in writing to Colleen Elliott, USIBWC, Acquisitions Division, 4171 N Mesa, Suite C100, El Paso, TX  79902.  Information submitted must clearly demonstrate company capabilities to provide the required service.  No further synopsis will be published.

The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) in Mechanicsburg PA is the contracting agency for the proposed contract.

The PBL will cover approximately 382 depot level repairable (DLR) and consumable items used to maintain these systems. No option periods apply.  The PBL will be awarded via firm fixed priced contract.  Under the PBL, the awardee will function as the Navy’s Commercial Stock Point for the covered items including the performance of inventory management functions including, but not limited to, forecasting, procuring, receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling.  The NAVICP will issue an RFP (!  N00104-06-R-L003) for this requirement once the Government’s requirements are finalized and all pre-solicitation requirements are satisfied.

<DESC>The government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price request for quotes (RFQ) for services (including labor) and materials for the installation of a complete fire suppression system into three separate computer rooms. The fire suppression system will be in support of data facilities with Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) installed with existing fire alarm indicators. There will need to be site surveys conducted. 

The approximate sizes of the three rooms by volume are as follows: 3696 ft3, 4054 ft3 and 1200 ft3, respectively. Systems shall use the Brand name Fenwal FM – 200 suppression systems, manufactured by Fenwal Protection Systems, 400 Main Street, Ashland, MA 01721 or an equal product/agent to negate hazards and facility restrictions of Halon and provide suppression without damaging APDE. The system should be able to tie into existing fire alarm for indicators only and incorporate both visual and audible alarms. Systems should be equipped to shut down HVAC systems to each of the three rooms. 

Systems should use multiple types of sensors such as heat, particulate and smoke etc., and require detection of more than one before beginning discharge countdown. The systems should afford the opportunity to prevent discharge of the fire suppression agent after detection/countdown. Systems should also include complete drawing packages and an option for an annual maintenance contract. Said maintenance contract should incorporate design, installation and testing costs. All designs must be approved by base installation Fire Marshall prior to providing any proposals.

Work will be performed in the (Hampton Roads) Norfolk, Virginia area. The proposed RFQ N00189-06-T-0339 will be posted on or before 19 July 2006 with a response date of        2 August 2006.

<DESC>The goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate innovative ultra-lightweight JP-8 fueled generator technology that is single-person portable for Marine Corps reconnaissance missions and remote sensors.  Many missions in remote locations are currently limited by the amount of power that can be carried on foot and/or left in place for unattended equipment operation.  Advanced rechargeable batteries are anticipated to significantly reduce the weight of batteries for Marine Corps Expeditionary units.  However, the lack of a sufficiently energetic power source that is not tied to a wall outlet or vehicle prevents on-foot expeditionary units from taking advantage of rechargeable battery technologies in the field.  The need to send personnel units (on foot or by vehicle) out to service batteries in remotely fielded sensors and equipment presents significant logistics and safety burdens and high cost.  

A 500-1000 Watt single person-portable, compact, lightweight, low signature (acoustic, thermal, and magnetic), JP-8 fueled generator would enable a significant reduction in the weight and cost of fielded batteries for expeditionary units and longer-term operation of remote sensors, limited only by the size of the fuel tank.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement for a Clinical Neurophysiology Device.

The Clinical Neurophysiology researchers in NINDS perform similar types of experiments, with slightly different hardware required for capturing the signals of interest.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Dr. Robert Burns and Iowa State University for sample collection and stream flow measurements at their Beef Nutrition Research Farm near Ames, Iowa.  US EPA requires a contractor that possesses the unique facility where this work can be conducted.  This unique facility is essential for contract performance because the University farm is a research farm fully under control of  the University and as such offers unique opportunities to carry out research that a privately owned feedlot would not.  Access is restricted to University personnel.  Iowa State University is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirements because the waste management system  installed at Iowa State is the only one known to exist for the purpose of research. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to  the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ  number is RFQ-OH-06-00180.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is  541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen: Acute Morbidity II.  Period of Performance:  August 2006- August  2008 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price  (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   217 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for  Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment(SA),historically known as a Criteria Document.   The EPA is now in the process of  reviewing the NAAQS for NO2.  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average. based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Oxides  of Nitrogen (EPA,1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. On February 23, 1984, the EPA proposed to retain this standard which was finalized on June 19, 1985.  The most recent review of the science on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993 Air  Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen(EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  In this review, the Administrator announced a final decision not to revise the standards on October 2, 1995.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be  established as a court-ordered schedule. The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the NO2  air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for  interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen oxides shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of  the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review  comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates  preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final NO2 SA. NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on oxides of nitrogen  physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this order, the EPA seeks the  professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from oxides of nitrogen exposure.  ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not  post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee order to procure technical and engineering support to modify a total of ninety-seven (97) CH-46E aircraft with Airborne Wireless Intercommunication Systems (AWICS) at MCAS New River, NC and MCAS Miramar, CA, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.     This effort shall include the replacement of the Permanent Magnetic Generator (PMG) wiring on thirty-one (31) aircraft that have not had the PMG wiring replaced when inducted for the AWICS modification.     Additionally, the effort shall include an option to provide Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) harness replacements.     This effort will commence 15 April 2006 and continue for one year.     The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to Boeing Aerospace Operations (BAO), Oklahoma City, OK.     The BAO teams currently on site at MCAS New River and MCAS Miramar, performing AFCS wire harness replacements, shall accomplish the AWICS and PMG wiring modifications, as well as the wire harness replacements, if required.     The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.     For these reasons, a competition will not be conducted.

The need for Social Security provided training is necessitated by the complexity of administering Section 218 Agreements. All states - including the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and approximately 60 interstate instrumentalities have a Section 218 Agreement with Social Security.  Each state has a State Administrator. State Administrators work closely with SSA to address Social Security and Medicare coverage and employment tax issues raised by state and local government employers. State Administrators report dealing with as many as 5,000 public entities a year depending on the state, which is why it is critical that they are adequately trained and supported in the functions of administering their respective stateâ€™s Social Security coverage issues. Therefore, it is necessary that the designer of the course material possess unparalleled knowledge of Section 218 of the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code, and state and local coverage procedures.
Written responses to this synopsis must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. A solicitation is not available. Requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.

<DESC>Notice of Intent

The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Eaton Electrical Services & Systems for two (2) VCP-W Medium Voltage Vaccum Breaker Test Cells in SSA’s NCC Utility building.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  As the manufacturer of the VCP-W medium voltage vacuum breaker, Eaton designs proprietary cubicles to work exclusively with the breaker.  The test cell incorporates a proprietary cubicle for the breaker to be tested and patented electrical controls to perform vacuum integrity testing of the entire breaker assembly.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment No. 2 to Solicitation 6TS-06-JAS-0003.  See Standard Form 30 and Page 2.  In order to insure that all potential vendors are aware of the facts as the GSA sees them, and so that all who offer proposals can prepare their pricing from an equal starting point, we want to clarify some of the numbers used in port counts we have provided.  We believe that on many of our systems, we are currently over supplied with active ports at this time.  We anticipate that, regardless of what vendor’s proposal is accepted, within a short time frame after award of this contract, we will be substantially reducing the number of ports on our systems.  Our anticipation is that, given the information provided in our first amendment on regrooming, we will be downsizing to an estimated total port count of approximately 14,000 within the first few months of performance on the new contract.  

The government emphasizes that the counts listed in the attachment are our best estimates, but are estimates only of the status after regrooming, and no assurances are given as to the ultimate accuracy of the numbers.  We do believe that these numbers will be more accurate, post-award, than those provided in the solicitation, and we urge all potential bidders to keep this information in mind as they calculate the per-port maintenance charges on their proposals.  NOTE:  GSA will not be adjusting Price Schedule A quantities to reflect the above numbers, for evaluation purposes, the quantities will remain as originally submitted. 
The closing date remains 3:00pm, CST, Friday, July 21, 2006 as extended in Amendment No. 1

c.	Phasing Plan
d.	Schedule Plan

From these schedules, the CMc will give their input.  The CMc will verify estimating services the A-E provides.

Question:	Who controls A-E Submissions & Level of Submissions?  Who keeps the Design & Scope on schedule?

Response:	CMc is responsible to keep the schedule on-track.  The ultimate responsibility if the scope/schedule should slip will be that of GSA.  However, the CMc will be responsible to provide recommendations/concerns regarding the scope & schedule and report them in a timely manner to GSA.  GSA will enforce the A-E to act and proceed according to schedule.

Question:	Will the CMc do their own cost estimate or will they verify that of the A-E’s?

Response:	The CMc will analyze and verify the A/E’s cost estimate. The cost estimate must not exceed the project’s budget.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the A-E regarding the schedule and phasing of the project?

Response:	Yes, it will be a collaborative effort of all parties.

Question:	How will scope be controlled?  What about “Tenant Improvement” work?

Response:	Scope will be developed during the Concept Stage.  The CMc will be participating in this stage to help define the scope so that changes will be minimized as the project progresses.  There is no tenant improvement work currently included in the scope; however, such work may arise as the project progresses.

Question:	What is the contingency for the project?

Response:	 GSA will have a small contingency during the Design & Construction Phases; however, the CMc SHOULD NOT RELY ON THESE FUNDS BECAUSE THE A/E AND THE CMc WILL BE SELECTED ON DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE CRITERIA.

Response:	GSA WILL NOT request funds for escalation. The Budget must be met.

Response:  Addressed in the RFP. The Estimate Construction Cost at Award is $36,000.000.

Question:	Will the four (4) Partnering Meetings be held in Washington D.C. or Indianapolis?

Response:	Partnering Sessions will be held in Indianapolis so that tenants can attend.

Question:	Commissioning Services- where do they start/end in regards to the CMc’s own commissioning services?

Response:	Panos Giannakopouls reads an excerpt from the draft RFP for 3rd Party Commissioning. 
•	The Commissioning Plan shall be provided by the Commissioning Agency
•	The Commissioning Agency shall conduct a focused review of te design prior to the construction document phase to ensure that each commissioned feature of system meets the owner’s requirements relative to functionality, energy performance, maintainability, system cost, indoor environmental quality, and local environmental impacts.
•	The Commissioning Authority must sufficiently observe installation of each type of commissioned feature to ensure that they are properly installed according to the contract documents and manufacturer’s instructions, and that other building components are not compromising the performance of the feature.
•	After the contractor completes the start-up and initial checkout of all items listed in the contract documents, the C. Agency applies appropriate techniques to verify that start-up and initial checkout of all commissioned equipment is successfully completed.
•	The C. Agency is to review and approve the contractor’s Testing & Balancing Contractor functional testing plan prior to the start of testing.
•	The C. Agency is to receive, review, and compile all General Contractor submittals.

Question:	The RFP indicates that the 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will perform mechanical/HVAC services only.  Is this true?

Response:	The 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide a commissioning plan, address lighting, environmental responsiveness and energy efficiency, HVAC, fire alarm system, sprinkler system, and LEED Commissioning.  GSA will clarify CMc’s scope regarding commissioning services.

Question:	Is there a duplication of commissioning services?  Commissioning should start during Design to gain a LEED point.  Refer to page 1-24, 4.35-“provide coordination.”

Response:	 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide the Commissioning Plan & Testing.  The CMc will do the work; the 3rd Party will observe, test, and verify.  GSA will clarify in amended RFP.

Question:	Is there swing space available?

Response:	There has been some space identified by building management and the previous A-E in the basement.  Some storage will also be converted into swing space.  This needs to be done to accommodate tenants.  GSA is aware that some tenants prefer not to move into this space.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the Building Manager to communicate and address tenant concerns?

Response:	During the Construction phase, the A-E as well as the CMc must have a Tenant Coordinator/Liaison.

Question:	Who will actually move fixtures, furniture, etc?

Response:	The CMc

Question:	Are there funds set-aside for security issues?  U.S. Marshall’s Services (USMS)?

Response:	Some funds are included in the project for guards.  USMS will fund aspects of the project according to their own agency requirements.

Question:	Will the GSA Building Manager be the communication point of contact between the CMc and the tenants?

Response:	Yes.

Question:	How many courtrooms are being renovated?

Response:	None.  No renovation of rooms- just Fire Alarm & Sprinkler systems.

Question:	What if the judge refuses to have fire protection and window replacement in their chambers?  Is there a requirement to make tenants comply?

Response:	We will comply with code.  GSA has a very stringent Fire & Life Safety (FLS) branch that is very involved in the project.  They will ensure that the project will be executed according to code.  They will take a firm responsibility that the code will be enforced.  All tenants will have to participate and comply.  The work will be done after-hours.  Planning is the key to success.

Question:	Are Security Clearances done through Homeland Security?

Response:	Yes.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility (A-E, CMc, CM, sub-contractors) to submit documents and obtain clearance.  Contractors need to be mindful that clearance takes time.

Question:	The RFP states that the selected CMc for pre-construction services will have the option to go to the construction phase.  Is this true?

Response:	Yes.  This is an option that GSA may choose to exercise.

Question:	Clarification needed for page 1-9 regarding: FY2005 Funds vs. Optional work.

Response:	GSA will provide the A-E’s schedule of submission.  It will be provided through an amended RFP or through meeting minutes.

Question:	Is the bonding requirement submitted at bid or at the construction phase?

Response:	At the Construction phase.



Question:	Construction estimates should be broken-out how?

•	FY06 Design – optional work
•	FY06 Construction – optional 

Question:	Provide clarification regarding the conversion of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) to a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  Ref. page 1-4, 2.8.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia announces its intent to issue a sole source solicitation to Sonalysts, Inc. for the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) for biomedical and operational research services in support of the Navy Lab’s research mission.  Specifically, the contractor must have the scientific knowledge and practical experience working in the Submarine Atmosphere Health Assessment program (SAHAP) to determine epidemiological factors of importance in ensuring the health of Naval personnel; conducting studies and research on problems associated with disabled submarines (DISSUB) to maximize chances of survival to include evaluation of multiple physiological parameters in terms of environmental and physiological systems; and the investigation of the performance and utility of Search and Rescue (SAR) devices, particularly escape scenarios.  The services include tasks such as the design, development, test, and evaluation of procedures, guidance, equipment, and systems to enhance human performance under the various environments mentioned above.  Sonalysts is the incumbent contractor and is considered the only source capable of providing the highly specialized services.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, since only Sonalysts possesses the required knowledge of the NSMRL programs mentioned above, and has the requisite research background and capabilities to continue the on-going support of the programs due to the extensive acumen in the respective research fields that is required of each researcher.  Current Sonalysts research efforts at the lab do not have a defined completion point.  Various projects and studies build on past research performed and are the basis of future projects and studies; thus, there is an integral need for a company with the corporate knowledge, research skills, and personnel resources that Sonalysts possesses.  It is anticipated that the services will be provided through the award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract for a base period of performance of one year with four one-year option periods.

Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the specified services as a sole source from Dr. Caryl Johnson of BAE Systems Spectral Solutions, LLC, 999 Bishop Street, Honolulu, Hawaii, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; No formal RFQ will be available.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Solar Integrated, a Hub-Zone contractor, to furnish and install an amorphous silicone BIPV system at the Waltham Federal Records Center.  This notice is not a request for proposals (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time.   The amorphous silicone BIPV system from Solar Integrated includes features which are either highly desirable or integral to our requirements.  These include:  thin film amorphous silicon panels, 60 mil PVC reinforced Energy Star rated membrane, and minimized visible wiring and wiring harness. 

The proposed contract will provide a cool Energy Star labeled, light colored PVC, 60 mil base membrane; a secondary cool Energy Star labeled, light colored PVC, 60 mil membrane with heat sealed flexible, thin film, amorphous silicon panels to generate approximately 350 kW – 400 kW of onsite electrical generation; a data acquisition system, with continuous web based photo and file viewing of system output, emission reductions and weather information in real time; multiple inverters, isolation transformers and all interconnect requirements of the local Utility, NStar Gas and Electric Company.  

The work performed under this contract includes the following specific items and tasks:  design/ build services to install and demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of a thin film amorphous silicon BIPV system. This will include complete integration with local Utility and utility electrical grid to the Utility’s specifications, data acquisition and annual maintenance of system, application to the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative Renewable Energy Trust for assistance grants, as well as application for interconnection with NStar.

Authorized re-sellers are not eligible for this requirement.  This acquisition will be with Solar Integrated and not with an authorized re-seller due to the increased price mark-up routinely associated with the third party company.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is FAR 6.302-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Solar Integrated has demonstrated with approximately 45 existing completed operating thin film systems the requisite experience and capability to supply the GSA with the essential BIPV system; training, integrated twenty year warranty, as well as maintenance capability.

Installation completion is desired by November 2006, but no later than June 2007.

Firms wishing to challenge the sole source acquisition must submit a letter of interest that demonstrates their firm’s ability to provide, and experience in providing, a BIPV system incorporating the features described above.  Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within ten (10) days of this notice.  If no affirmative written response is received within ten (10) days after publication of this notice to the effect that a comparable qualified source is available, a sole-source award will be negotiated with Solar Integrated.  A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Interested parties shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment as to whether the product and capabilities meet technical acceptability.  Interested parties must demonstrate they are capable of providing a complete warranty for the BIPV system and that they can conform to all pertinent codes including, but not necessarily limited to: IBC, GSA-PBS – P100, NEC, IEEE1547, UL-1741.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statement and documentation by e-mail to Kathryn Thomas at kathryn.thomas@gsa.gov or by mail to GSA, Property Development Division, 10 Causeway Street, Room 975, Boston, MA  02222.    Responses should include a contact name and phone number, size of business and number of years in business and number of years experience with thin film amorphous BIPV.  The Government will not pay for any information or materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  If a solicitation is later released it may be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine sources with the capability and availability to meet requirements of US Coast Guard MSU Port Arthur’s Incident Command Post (hereinafter ICP); during the 2006 Hurricane Season for the contractor to provide a facility to set up a 24/7 operational command post.  The US Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is the procuring office for this action.  In an event of the possibility of a Category 2 to 5 hurricanes, during the hurricane season, US Coast Guard Port Arthur ICP; which is a 24 hour 7 day a week operational command center; will need to be stood up in to a safe location that is away from current hurricane and potential future hurricane hazards and dangers.  This facility will also need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead US Coast Guard post hurricane operations.  The US Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the “first right” to use the facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 2 or more hurricane to hit the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation of Port Arthur, Texas or Lake Charles, LA.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 2 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up. At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit, this will require that USCG Port Arthur stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the Port Arthur, Texas or Lake Charles, LA areas.  Port Arthur will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The ICP location needs to be within at least 200 miles and up to 250 miles North of MSU Port Arthur, Texas located at 2901 Turtle Creek Drive, Port Arthur, Texas.  Hospitals must be near by in addition to other basic amenities (commercial airport, availability of food) if the Coast Guard cannot return to their office in Port Arthur.  Office space/conference rooms - four office/conference rooms to house a day/night, 24-hour watch.  One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 10,000 square feet and the other three rooms must be no smaller than 120 square feet.  The 10,000 square feet office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 30 phone/fax lines and 20 internet connections spread out in the room. The three smaller conference rooms (no smaller than 120 square feet) must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 phone lines and 5 computer lines.  The Coast Guard must have the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows.  The facility shall provide tables and chairs for at least 100 people.  The 10,000 square feet conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to have 20 electric outlets distributed throughout the room.  The other three smaller conference rooms must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 electric outlets distributed throughout each room.  Up to 150 hotel rooms may also be needed, therefore the operational facility must be within walking distance (1/2 mile) from hotels that could accommodate this number of rooms.  Parking will be needed for up to 200 vehicles.  The office/conference facility should be near locations or have the capability to serve full nutritious meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner and midnight rations (finger food) service.  It is the Coast Guard’s intent to issue a IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) to obtain services.  Interested sources should provide the following information via to the address below. Name of Company and Address, Point of Contact and phone number, Distance from Port Arthur, TX, List of Hotels and capacity that are within walking distance (1/2 mile from facility), Business Size (small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business or women-owned small business concerns). The NAICS code is 531120 (rental of building, non-residential). The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing August 2006.  No other sources sought notice will be provided.  Interested vendors should respond to this notice by Close of Business July 21, 2006. Competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research.  At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  This notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This is a sources sought announcement, and as such does not constitute a solicitation of proposal, and authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract for the contemplated effort. Funds are not currently available. This solicitation amplifies on information provided in the original sources sought notice #FBO-01027698 dated Apr 13, 2006.  In addition to systems and subsystems described in the Apr 13, 2006 sources sought notice, the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV), Indian Head, Maryland is also requesting information on alternative neutralization techniques to mitigate damage to ships hulls, underwater piers/pilings and structures during neutralization  of attached limpet mines and/or emplaced explosive devices.  Neutralization approaches may include but are not limited to: disrupter charges, pyrotechnic torches, chemical reducing, and other potential blast mitigating or re-directing too!  ls that can potentially reduce the effectiveness of terrorist-placed explosives against target hulls or underwater structures.  Additionally, the government is interested in alternative attachment or station keeping methods for these tools onto ferrous or non-ferrous hulls or other underwater structures (e.g., pier walls and pilings).  Reliable precision placement of tools is required, as well as the ability to maintain precise position for an unspecified period of time.  As indicated in the original solicitation, the purpose of this study is to identify alternative technologies that may be suitable for integration into an eventual unmanned underwater system to localize and neutralize limpet mines and other explosive devices that may be placed on or near a ship hull or on pier and piling structures near ship berths.  Proposed tools/systems designed for ease of integration onto an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) for ultimate placement by a UUV will be given highest conside!  ration.  Tool/system descriptions and performance information is sough t in the form of prior studies, brochures, specification sheets, and company points of contact.  Any information available on demonstrated or expected performance in varied environments (e.g., low visibility, light, dark, currents, etc.) and estimated unit cost is also desired.  The focus of this solicitation is on proven, mature technologies that could be ready for integration/transition to systems as early as 2008/2009 timeframe. Information received from respondents in the initial solicitation is appreciated and is being reviewed.  It is not necessary to provide information that has been previously submitted in response to the previous sources sought notice or solicitations for the EOD HULS and HULSFEST projects.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor will the Government return any data provided. Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time.  Deadline for subm!  ission is 22 August 2006.   Questions regarding this solicitation may be directed to the above POC.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PROGRAMMABLE UNIVERSAL CREW TEST DEVICES Introduction.  In support of the military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Department of Defense has an urgent need to procure test devices that are capable of determining the operational condition of radio-frequency countermeasure systems.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is soliciting information from industry regarding the availability of systems that can be matured for use for a variety of mounted and man-portable Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  The proposed test devices should be mature (TRL 7 or above) and ready for immediate fabrication and test, and rapid production in quantity.    We desire information on two different types of system.   •	A portable hand-held test system for rapid confidence check •	A ground-based diagnostic test set that can be used to perform a more detailed evaluation  General Description.  For each type of system (see above), two specific operating modes are required.  When operating in the reactive mode, the test device periodically emits a signal (stimulation) and then monitors the desired frequency bands for received power from the Unit Under Test (UUT).  In the active mode, the test device continuously measures power within the selected band and provides indication of the received power level.  We desire that these all test devices be able to: •	Measure received RF power within a selected band; •	Compare the power value to a stored minimum acceptable level; and •	Indicate if the power is above the minimum level.    The Department of Defense is currently developing specific requirements and specifications for this effort.  The following general requirements are applicable:  A)	Be capable of rapidly providing a visual indication of CREW system operating conditions, regardless of the brand, make or model of the CREW system that is under evaluation B)	Ground-based test device size weight, volume, form and function should be such that testing can quickly be performed at fixed locations C)	Portable hand-held device size weight, volume, form and function should be such that testing can be performed by combat unit personnel on the move.  D)	The test device shall not interfere with Blue Force communications and other operating systems. E)	Each test set shall provide for storage and selection of multiple test configurations where each configuration may have multiple specific test scenarios with their own pass-fail criteria.  Each test configuration shall be identifiable by number and a unique, user-defined name.   F)	The test set shall provide for programming/reprogramming the operating program, test configurations, conditions and pass-fail parameters via a standard interface such as ethernet or USB.  The reprogramming method shall be suitable for use at organizational-level maintenance.   G)	The test set shall provide for direct input of transmit signal from the UUT and shall provide adequate input attenuation for proper scaling of power measurement and protection to prevent damage to the test set. H)	The test set shall provide an operator selectable test of common timing protocol input and provide a pass/fail indication. Responses To This Request For Information.  Responses must include; system description, performance specifications and parameters, the overall capabilities of the system(s) against the above general requirements including: •	All possible power sources that the system is capable of using •	The TRL of the system with justification •	Additional detailed information regarding the system capabilities/performance (prior testing, test reports, etc.) •	Summary of logistics, training, & maintenance requirements •	System unit costs in quantities of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 •	System production rates, including the lead time for first delivery and production ramp up rates. Responses must include a cost estimate for fabrication and delivery of two (2) portable hand-held test systems, and one (1) ground-based diagnostic test set.  These delivered units may be used to perform a follow-up product evaluation. Responses may be in any format.  Electronic submissions are acceptable and preferred.  If responding to both types of test devices, provide a separate and separable response for each system.  Responses are limited to 15 [8 ½ x 11 in] pages.   Responses to this RFI must be received on or before 10:00 AM EST 7 August 2006 at NAVSEASYSCOM, 1333 Isaac Hull Ave.  Washington D.C. S.E. 20376 Blg 197, 5W2118 Attn:  Mary Ann Keyser.  Electronic responses should be sent to MaryAnn.Keyser@navy.mil.  The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with respondents based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and specification of the information provided.  Please note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions.  The information provided in response to this RFI may be used to support urgent, on-going, initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for mounted and man-portable CREW systems and may ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to host an Industry Day to establish communications with potential sources with the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to integrate and produce a non-developmental modification to existing Direct Attack weapons (i.e., LGB/ JDAM) to provide tactical flexibility and the ability to hit moving targets for use on the USN F/A-18 A+/C/D/E/F and AV-8B aircraft.   The Department of the Navy (DoN) wants to capitalize on existing inventories of GBU-12 and GBU-38 weapons.  This moving target weapon is envisioned to be a retrofit and/or add-on capability that will be integrated into the current inventories of GBU-12 or GBU-38 systems, with a potential initial procurement in FY 2008.  

The Government is seeking participation from interested companies, and they are invited to attend an Industry Day to be held at 46641 Corporate Drive, Lexington Park, Maryland, 20653 on 03 August 2006.  Attendees should plan to arrive between 0730 and 0800 (EST). Industry Day will begin at 0800 and briefings will continue through 1200.   This information exchange will provide an open forum for discussion of ideas before a formal Request for Information (RFI) is issued.  Security clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified.  Industry Day will entail a presentation by the Government followed by questions and answers.  Optional one-on-one side meetings with interested companies will follow the briefing. Pre-registration is required.   All Industry Day pertinent information will be made available via the NAVAIR Electronic Solicitation Website http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.    All amendments will be posted at the same Internet website.  Interested parties should regularly access the website to ensure that they have all amendments.  Companies interested in attending the Industry Day concerning the moving target weapon should limit their representation to no more than three (03) individuals. Companies shall provide the Name of the Company, Point of Contact (POC), Title, E-Mail address, Phone Number, Birth Country and State (if in the US), Citizenship and Country of Residence.  This information shall be e-mailed to: Mary Brutkiewicz, mary.brutkiewicz@navy.mil not later than 26 July 2006.  

Foreign Participation. This program may require a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms. To participate, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program. Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. The U.S. Government will provide foreign disclosure guidance to the U.S. firms.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 10 and 12.6, this is a Sources Sought notice for commercial aircraft engine overhaul and repair services under NAICS Code 336412, Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to procure aircraft engine overhaul and repair services for the Rolls Royce (Allison) series 250-C18/T63-A-700 turboshaft engine used for oil qualification testing at Patuxent River NAS, MD.  The anticipated quantity is one to two engine overhauls per year under a prospective five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinte Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with provisions for both Firm Fixed Price and Time and Materials contract line items.  The T63 engine is used in a test cell for the qualification of aviation turbine engine oils and helicopter gearbox oils as required by Military Specification MIL-PRF-23699, and is used to evaluate oil degradation characteristics under severe operating conditions. 

A synopsis of the anticipated requirement to assist industry in understanding the effort under this Sources Sought notice follows below.  No promise of a contract award is implied and contractors are not being asked to submit cost proposals.  Rather this notice requests capabilities information that illustrates sources can successfully perform this anticipated effort, either directly or through teaming arrangements.  Direction to look at company websites and vague statements of capability are not encouraged.  

Firm Fixed Price tasks are as follows:
1. The T63 engine willl be shipped to the Contractor disassembled.  The Contractor shall clean and examine the engine parts to insure operational safety.  All oil wetted parts shall be cleaned to “as new” condition.  Non-destructive inspections are required on the gas producer and power turbine rotaing components.  
2.  Replace the number 6, 7 and 8 bearings and the number 6/7 bearing external oil sump on every rebuild with new parts.
3.  Provide an inspection report with a quoted price for all parts identified during the inspection that require repair or replacement.  Actual work to replace or repair, if authorized by the Government, will be performed under a Time and Materials line item.
 
Time and Materials (following cleaning and inspection) tasks are as follows:
a.  Replace any unsafe or excessively worn components identified in the inspection.  
b.  Repair or replace those parts, not immediately identified as unsafe or excessively worn, as provided on the Inspection Report, if authorized by the Government.  
c.  Due to high temperature operations of engines in the Navy’s testing, the oil pump and pressure regulator in the gearbox require additional overhaul actions.  The helical spring in the poppet valve of the oil pressure regulator (P/N 6809796) must be replaced with a new part during each overhaul.  The oil pump should be rebuilt so the gear “end clearance” is at the lower end of the stated 0.002-0.004 tolerance range.  This is to ensure adequate pump pressure at higher operating temperature during testing.
d.  The power turbine governor and gas producer fuel control will be preserved before shipment and should be functionally checked on the engine during the test cell check run.  If functional problems arise, the Government point of contact (POC) shall be notified before proceeding with repairs.
e.  Check all component accessories according to standard industry procedures to insure satisfactory and safe operation.
f.  After the engine has been reassembled, it shall be operated on a test stand at the Contractor’s facility to insure that it is running properly; the fuel control and lubrication systems are free of leaks; the engine vibration levels are within normal limits; and engine performance is within 10 percent of the specified limits at the proper turbine outlet termperatures.  Particular emphasis shall be placed on maintaining oil comsumption below 100 ml/hr and maintaining gearbox breather pressure below 10 inches of water at the normal rated power setting.  Note: The Government does not intend to include the building of a test stand for Contractor performance under this effort.  Contractors are expected to already have a suitable test stand available at their own facility that is able to meet the requirements of testing the reassembled engines, or have the ability and resources to subcontract for the test stand use.

Notes:
1.  Replacement parts need not be in a flight worthy condition, but must ensure safe operation of the engine in a test cell.  The Government will consider bypassing the normal ‘flight ready’ quality control checkpoints that are nonessential for NAVAIR engines and the use of non-flight worthy components during overhaul.
2.  Labor rates utilized under the Time and Materials portion of the contract, if a contract is awarded, are to be fully loaded through profit.  Materials shall be non-fee or non-profit bearing.
3.  NO reimbursement for any costs associated with Contractor submittal of materials/information, in response to this Sources Sought, will be made.

<SUBJECT>B -- Produce Specific Extracts from Natural Forest Products for Use Against Arthropods
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Oregon State University, 119 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331-5751, to produce specific extracts from natural forest products and deliver to CDC for use in studies against arthropods to be conducted in CDC laboratories. Background: arthropods transmit the etiologic agents of several human diseases causing an important impact on public health within the United States. The blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the principal vector of Lyme disease spirochetes, the agent causing human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and human babesiosis. Fleas transmit plague causing bacteria in the United States, and mosquitoes transmit the West Nile Virus and other arboviruses within the United States. Although chemical pesticides and repellents are available to combat these disease transmitting pests, many citizens are hesitant about the use of these pesticides due to concerns about short range toxicity and long range health problems attributed to these chemicals. Plants have long been shown to have natural chemical defenses against arthropods. The exploitation of plants to provide natural, least-toxic pesticides and repellents is a high priority for CDC in the combat against vector-borne disease. The vendor will furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to extract, identify, and produce quantities of proprietary terpene compounds (naturally occurring hydrocarbons containing 15 carbon atoms and 10 carbon atom monoterpenes) from natural product and synthetic sources to be tested by CDC/NCID/DVBID, Fort Collins, CO, for repellency and biocidal activity against arthropods and other pests of public health importance. In doing so the vendor shall perform the following tasks: 1) Prepare a minimum of 5 grams at purity levels > 95% of each of 5 identified proprietary C15 sesquiterpenes with arthropod biocidal and repellent activity for testing at CDC. These 5 compounds have been previously isolated and identified. A patent currently exists on these 5 compounds. 2) Isolate, identify, characterize, and prepare a minimum of 2 grams at purity levels > 95% of each of 2 newly discovered and related C15 sesquiterpenes for testing at CDC. These 2 compounds have been isolated and identified.  A patent currently exists on these 2 new compounds from Alaskan yellow cedar (AYC). 3) Provide a minimum of 10 grams of steam distilled C15 sesquiterpenes extracted from Alaskan yellow cedar (AYC) foliage and 2 C10 monoterpenes using oxidation processes. 4) Ship compounds to CDC, Fort Collins, CO with data for each sample to include chemical name, purity, date of purification and amount (weight and/or volume). Data including biocidal and repellent activity of these compounds will be written and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal with CDC researchers and vendor as authors. Vendor will have the choice of writing and submitting chemical data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal with the potential of CDC researchers as authors. Any potential offerors must be able to produce specific extracts from natural forest products and deliver to CDC for use in studies against arthropods to be conducted in CDC laboratories.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH FOR AERIAL SUPERVISION AIRPLANES

Contracting Office:  

Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), 3833 South Development Avenue, Boise, ID  83705-5354

Description:

The USDA Forest Service is contemplating an upgrade of its aerial supervision fleet of airplanes utilized for initial attack, extended attack, and lead plane functions on wildfires.  The purpose of this request for information is to conduct market research to determine if there are commercial airplanes (with or without modifications) available in the marketplace to fulfill the aerial supervision performance requirements within reasonable pricing parameters, which may ultimately result in the solicitation of competitive proposals for the dry lease of approximately 10 airplanes (with a possible increase of up to 20 airplanes), of the same model from either a single vendor, or multiple vendors, at a later date.  The airplanes will be operated by Government employee pilots and fuel for the airplanes will be purchased by the Government.  The airplanes will be maintained by the contractor/vendor.  
  
The following is a list of the basic minimum requirements needed for aerial platforms to fulfill the aerial supervision mission:

-	Airplanes must be turbine powered.
-	Must be equipped with basic Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) equipment as defined by the FAA.
-	Minimum flight endurance is 4 hours.
-	Multi-engine.
-	Certified for Single Pilot by the FAA.
-	Dual controls.
-	Avionics:  The airplanes must be capable of having the following standard avionics included in the airplanes:  Glide Slope/Localizer, Two VHF 760 Channel Communication/Navigation radios, Low Frequency Receiver, Transponder, IFR Approach Certified, Global Positioning System, IFR Certified Autopilot, VHF-FM, Three Audio Selection Panels, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Advisory and Warning System (TAWS), Collision Avoidance System, and Cockpit Voice Recorder.  
-	The ability to add visibility enhancements to make the airplanes highly visible from ground to air and air to air (i.e., color and/or high intensity lighting).
-	Air Conditioning.
-	Demonstrated ability to deal with particulates/smoke found in the air environment over fires.
-	Certificated by the FAA to operate in known icing conditions.
-	Meet the Federal Acquisition Act implementation of the Buy American Act and its exceptions for Government acquisition of airplanes.
-	Airplanes must be in current production or nearing current production; or if not in current production, a minimum of 400 airplanes must have been produced with a production of mid-point 1990 or later, with no more than 2,000 total airframe time.
-	Airplanes must have been completely built by the manufacturer, i.e., no kit airplanes.
-	Minimum Flight Deck capacity of two.
-	Minimum cruise speed of 230 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS).
-	Minimum control airspeed (Vmca) shall not exceed 100 KIAS.
-	Maximum stall speed (Vso) of 90 KIAS.
-	Minimum Single Engine Service Ceiling of 10,000 ft. msl.

The airplanes have the potential to be operated at altitudes less than 500 feet above ground level, in mountainous terrain, with the normal turbulence associated with the wildfire environment.  

Interested parties wishing to participate in this market research may provide relative information and/or brochures for airplanes that meet or exceed the above mission requirements to the following address, by JULY 28, 2006:

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to purchase additional laboratory equipment and reagents with a limited shelf life for use in an on-ongoing study from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California. Items are required to maintain consistency and continuity in research projects which are already in place. This requirement is a not small business set-aside, market research has shown that Applied Biosystems does not have small business distributors and there is no reasonable expectation that 2 or more small business quotations can be obtained. Small business may purchase products from Applied Biosystems however, the product must arrive to the Centers for Disease Control in a refrigerated state, unrefrigerated reagents can not be used for this study and will be refused, and therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to utilize the products purchased directly from Applied Biosystems. Be advised unrefrigerated reagents will NOT be accepted by the CDC. Applied Biosystems will not guarantee their products unless they are shipped directly from Applied Biosystems to the End User. Shipments will only be accepted Monday thru Friday from 8:00 am – 4:30 pm EST with the exception of Federal Government holidays. The following items are urgently needed to re-stock the laboratory: 
Clin 00001:  4331183 TaqMan, 98 each, Clin 00002: 4326614, FG 50ml, TAWMAN UNIV PCR MSTR MIX, NO UNG, 4 Each, Clin 0003: 430441, TQMN, 1000RXN, GOLD BUFFER “A” OK/MNL, 2 Each, Clin 0004, 4314320, TF, ADHESIVE OPTICAL COVER WITH PLATES, 2 Each.

The government reserves the right to make award to more than one vendor and the right to delete or add additional equipment via amendments to the synopsis/solicitation.  Awards to be made will be placed in 4 increments.  Below is the estimated award schedule that will be used to place orders.  The award dates are approximate and it is expected that deliveries will not exceed 30 calendar days from award date.  All long lead items (deliveries over 30 days) must be justified, explained in writing and accepted by the Government before any such order is placed.

Initial Award		11 AUG 06	Delivery	12 SEP 06
1st Increment		18 AUG 06	Delivery	18 SEP 06
2nd Increment		25 AUG 06	Delivery	25 SEP 06
3rd Increment		30 AUG 06	Delivery	29 SEP 06

Please include all requirements on quotations.  All CLINs must meet the specified Brand Name requirements. In addition to the guidance contained in FAR 52.212-4, contractors shall submit proof of delivery with their invoices.  Proof of delivery may be in the form of a bill of lading or other shipping document signed by the receiving office.  Invoices received without proof of delivery will not be accepted.  

Vendors may propose on one, more than one, all or any combination of CLINS required under this solicitation.  The evaluation of each CLIN proposed will be based on the following steps:

Step 1 -  Vendor proposals will be reviewed to determine if they are technically acceptable (meet the Brand Name requirements)

Step 2 – Proposals considered to be technically acceptable will be evaluated regarding their proposed delivery schedule and price (NOTE:  Delivery schedule is more important than price) 

Step 3 – Vendors considered for award will be notified via ITSS (NOTEs:  1- All awards will be subject to the funds available for each CLIN; 2 - All vendors must be registered in ITSS and CCR to be considered for award).

Example:

           Step 1	          Step 2                
Vendor A   technically acceptable delivery and price acceptable         
Vendor B   technically un-acceptable
Vendor C   technically acceptable  price un-acceptable 
Vendor D   technically acceptable  delivery and price acceptable 
Vendor E   technically acceptable  delivery un-acceptable

In the example above only Vendors A and D would be considered as potential for award (Step 3).  The Government reserves the right to acquire anywhere from 0 to the number required from any vendor considered to be technically acceptable and have an acceptable delivery schedule for the price. 

The GSA Region 6 Final Invoice and Release of Claims Procedure is as follows:

(a) Unless otherwise specified, original invoices shall be submitted to the designated billing address. In addition to invoice requirements already specified, one additional invoice is to be submitted to the designated Project Manager as designated by the task or order.

(c) In addition to the requirements for a proper invoice specified in this contract or order, the following information or documentation must be submitted with the final invoice:     GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims.  With submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a release of all claims on GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims (required only on final payments) against the Government relating to this contract.  It shall state “NONE” unless the contractor has claims in stated amounts that are specifically excepted by the Contractor from the release.  If a proper Release of Claims fails to accompany the Contractor’s request for final payment, the Government will return the invoice to the contractor within seven days after its receipt, without action.     

(d) Final Payment.     The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under this contract after--     
       (1)        Completion and acceptance of invoiced work;

<DESC>The Serial and Government Publications Division (SER) of the Library of Congress houses approximately 55,000 serial titles, primarily in Roman alphabet languages.  A major preservation function of the Division is to prepare serial issues for binding on a regular basis.  After the serials are assembled into bindable units, the bindable unit is barcoded, and the Library of Congress integrated library system (LC-ILS) is updated to uniquely  identify the new serial volume and to indicate its status and future location in the Library (inventory control).

This contract will be for binding preparation of approximately 3,000 serial titles and serials inventory control of approximately 25,000-27,000 bindable serial units.  It will be a firm fixed unit price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the specified services. The contract will be awarded to the offeror whose combination of technical and price proposals represents the best value to the government within the available Library of Congress resources.  Work will be performed in the work areas of the Serial and Government Publications Division, Madison Building, Library of Congress.  It will require a permanent, full-time on-site project manager and three to four technicians.

Binding preparation consists of retrieving loose issues from the SER serials stacks, assembling and collating them into proper order, preparing binding instructions for the binder on LARS  binding preparation software, quality reviewing work, and delivering work to the Binding and Collections Care Division of the Library for shipment to the contract binder.  It further requires distinguishing binding styles, methods of leaf attachment, and types of cover cloth used by the Library of Congress, as well as understanding standard instructions that must be given the bindery based on pieces in hand.  Serials inventory control involves barcoding bindable units, creating or editing item records in the LC-ILS, creating or updating holdings records in the LC-ILS, and suppressing reference to the loose issues being bound in the Library’s online public access catalog. Item and holdings records are constructed according to national and Library of Congress standards.  Inventory work is done after a batch of bindable units is prepared and before it leaves SER.  The work requires working in cataloging, acquisitions, and OPAC modules of the LC-ILS, which is a Voyager product.

The Statement of Work will be posted as a separate supplement to this combined solicitation/synopsis.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333319 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business manufacturer under the NAICS code identified above.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Precision Engineering Division has a requirement to upgrade an existing Velocity Control Loop for Automated Stack of Indexing Tables

The upgrade shall implement a velocity feedback loop for control and operation of the drive motors.  The additional control loop shall work to provide smooth velocity and motion control while the existing positioning loop will continue to provide feedback for absolute positioning.	


All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  

Line Item 0001 	
Vendor shall provide, install, and tune (all necessary hardware, cables, equipment, and software) dual-loop controllers for the indexing tables of our automated angle measurement system.  The dual loop shall consist of a new velocity control loop which shall supplement the existing position control loop.  For smooth motor control and operating motion, the new velocity control loop shall be based on encoder feedback directly from upgraded drive motors.  For precise positioning of the tables, the existing positioning control loop shall be based on feedback from separate existing encoders that measure the angular position of the tables (1 per table).


The existing motors shall be replaced with newer-design off the shelf motors provided that the replacement motors meet the prior described criteria specified above.

General Requirements:
Velocity feedback.
•Replace the existing drive motors with new drive motors that use an encoder, not tachometer, for feedback.  The encoder must have at least 1000 lines per revolution, which can be translated into at least 4000 counts per revolution.  This encoder output shall then have to be used to derive velocity feedback in a manner consistent with our existing system.  
•Replace existing cabling from each drive motor to its drive amplifier (if necessary).  •Replace existing drive motor amplifiers if not adequate or compatible with new motors.  

Software requirements:
•Tune the amplifiers and PMAC control system via existing software and diagnostics, with hardware and software adjustments as needed, so as to provide smooth operation of the upgraded control system.
•The vendor shall ensure that the upgraded system will act in such a manner that it is fully compatible with the higher level computer control that currently runs the instrument. The existing motion control board is a 4 axis PMAC-Lite, made by Delta Tau. The current system provides homing, positioning, fault-detection and protection, pneumatic lifting, and also control of a rotary air-bearing table. (This table is not to be confused with the 3 indexing tables: there is no need to change the control system for the air bearing table.)  

Replacement Motor requirements
•The new motors shall be completely compatible with the existing motors (schematic and pictures of the existing motor supplied upon request). 
•The drive capability of the new motors should be consistent with the existing motors.  •The new motors shall be mechanically compatible with the needs of the existing system: they shall include identical output shaft dimensions and have an identical tapped and threaded hole pattern (specified in the schematic) to be direct plug and play replacements with the existing hardware necessary to connect each motor with its gearbox.  
•There must also be sufficient physical space for each new motor to be attached in place of each old motor.  

To obtain a copy of the schematic and pictures of the existing motor, request must be sent to Tye Gibson (tyegibson@nist.gov).  

Line Item 0002			

Installation:
Installation shall occur at NIST and include, at a minimum, uncrating, set-up and hook up of all equipment; integration of all new equipment; installation and start-up of all new software, turn-key start-up of the system; functional test to ensure all components are working and demonstration of specifications.

Training:
The Contractor shall provide training, on-site at NIST, for two (2) NIST personnel.  The training, shall be performed concurrently for the two (2) members, cover a complete description of the components and maintenance of the system and, at a minimum, a description of how each component works, a description and demonstration of the new software, with explicit instructions about how each segment of the software works.  

The vendor will provide 1 hour of training of in the use of the PMAC system diagnostic capabilities to observe motion profiles. Total training is anticipated to be not less than two (2) hours.



      Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1.  Physical inspection at NIST laboratory for adherence to specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  

Acceptance testing:

Acceptance testing shall verify that any changes in the system have not compromised the system’s capability for performing the other functions already implemented into the higher level software. The tests may be to move to random positions and return, or move d to a series of positions chosen by NIST without degradation of performance of the upgraded control system, verified by diagnostics. 

Acceptance Testing Requirements
•The new motors and upgraded control system shall work continuously without failure for a period of up to one week
•The upgraded dual-loop system shall provide motion control without oscillation, following errors, or other indicators of poor servo control, while matching the current existing system performance in terms of the speed of a commanded angular move.  
•The time required for the upgraded system to perform an angular move to a target position within a commanded range, from start to finish, must at least match the performance of the existing system, and it must reach the commanded angular position without excessive overshoot, ringing, or dither.
•It must be verified that the instrument returns to its home-position properly.
•Diagnostics will be used to verify that the commanded motion profile is followed, with smooth acceleration/deceleration profiles as needed to avoid any excessive forces in the system.


Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENT:  	REQ 26 &amp; 27 - Network Appliance PROGRAM:	IT Operations, 005N JUSTIFICATION:	 Purchase of the Network Appliance is justified in order to leverage existing Network Appliance infrastructure.   This is a contingency solution and an add-on to existing architecture.  By using the same architecture, we will be able to add to the existing Network Appliance near-store and long-term storage systems already in place at the Falling Waters facility.  We will also be able to mirror the millions of log files stored in Falling Waters required for tracking and research to an Alternate Site.  Use of the same architecture is necessary to efficiently accomplish the mirroring task, in addition to centralized management and monitoring of the system.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR&#160;Subpart&#160;42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one&#160;business day's written notification of its intention to (A)&#160;change the name in the CCR database; (B)&#160;comply with the requirements of Subpart&#160;42.12; and (C)&#160;agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.  (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart&#160;32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.  (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR&#160;Subpart&#160;42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one&#160;business day's written notification of its intention to (A)&#160;change the name in the CCR database; (B)&#160;comply with the requirements of Subpart&#160;42.12; and (C)&#160;agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.  (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart&#160;32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.  (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>The following questions have been received and are answered.

Q. My company has experience conducting focus groups of hospital patients but not specifically about medical devices.  Does this mean that we would most likely lose 40 evaluation points?

A. It cannot be predicted how many points lack of experience directly with medical devices will cost an offeror in the technical evaluation.  Similar or related experience may generate some credit if technical reviewers find it relevant.

Q. Can all six focus groups take place in the Washington DC area?  A. Yes

Q. Will the FDA provide the contractor with lists from which to recruit? A. No

Q. Is there an incumbent? A. This is a new requirement.

<DESC>Board of Veterans Appeal Hearing Transcription Court Reporting Services Please note that this is only the questions and the answers. The New solicitation due date will be July 21, 2006 by 12:00p EST. Please refer to solicitation VA-101-06-RQ-0146-A1 if you have any questions. Again this is only the posting of the questions and answers; the actual solicitation is due July 21, 2006 by 12:00p I apologize for not getting all of the questions answered but will get answers to the remaining two questions as soon as the program gets back to me.  Please note that I have deleted the entire Solicitation under this amendment for the purpose of posting the questions and answers. Questions and Answers to Transcription Services Solicitation Question 1: Page 1 "General Information" Would you please verify the 2:00 p.m., June 21, 2006 electronic Original/Current Response Date. A. The response date is July 21, 2006 by 12:00p est.  Question 2: Page 3 "Deliverables"   With regard to the On-Site Court Reporting Services or optional speaker phone transcription, would you please verify that the delivery due is the day the service is provided.  Answers below to similar questions should answer your question. Question 3: Please define the term "certified reporters." A.  Someone that is certified in their profession with some kind of certificate or credentials. Question 4: Page 4 "Technical Quote (Volume 1) Would you please clarify the meaning of the following sentence: "- the approach proposed is complete and adequate and in accordance with accomplishing, assessing, mapping, and determining the cost of the EEO counseling process." A. I don't think this has any relevance to this Solicitation. Question 5: With regard to the following solicitation text:  "The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months," since the Contractor's price per page bid will be a firm-fixed price, how are price adjustments made using the prevailing labor rates and is there a conversion factor used to multiply an average amount of transcribed pages per hour times the labor rate? This is a Firm Fixed Price order so the above doesn't pertain to this order. There will be a clause included in the event that the government needs to extend services or extend the term of the contract, however the prices at that time will be determined on the labor rates at that point in time. Question 6: Prior to the Bid Response Date, will the Government provide VA computer network connectivity technical and security specifications necessary to submit electronic transcripts?  A. I am quite sure that prior to award and not before RFQ response date that the government will give further guidance on that subject.  Question 7: Please specifically outline the VA training requirements pertaining to the Privacy Act and VA Cyber Security Awareness program.   The Contractor(s) will ensure that contract personnel have met VA training requirements pertaining to the Privacy Act and VA Cyber Security Awareness, which are available via the VA virtual private network and can be completed in approximately one hour each.                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 2 Question 8:               Please provide a sample Work Order and outline the steps necessary to submit a completed Work Order. A sample work order will be provided prior to award or awards being made. Question 9: The Specifications of Page Layout described in the solicitation appears to resemble transcription by strictly typists using only audiotapes of previously recorded hearings.  Since the solicitation specifically describes the use of court reporters, will the page layout specifications accommodate the stenographic court reporting transcript format predominately used in official court hearings and depositions? I will get an answer to this question as soon as the program office provide me with it. In reviewing the above-referenced RFQ, the following questions arose:  1.&#160; How and when will the attachments be provided for review?  Once the awards have been made the attachments will be sent to all of the awardees. 2.&#160; Will various vendors be utilized for different aspects of the contract, or must one vendor provide all the listed services? Various Vendors will be utilized; please by all means you can submit your proposal for 1 part or all of the listed required areas. 3.&#160; When will the &quot;transcription only&quot; aspect of the contract begin?  Everything will begin after award; more details will be given at time of award or after award. 4.&#160; Will a videographer be needed for the video conferencing?&#160;  I will get an answer to this question as soon as the program office provide me with it. 5.&#160; For the on-site reporter services, will there be consecutive hearings during the day or will they be held simultaneously and different locations, and will transcription be required the same day? A.  On average,  &#160; 5 Central Office hearings per day 12 video hearings per day 12 Waco travel board hearings on the days the Board is conducting such hearings 12 Waco travel board hearings on the days the Board is conducting such hearings &#160; The contractor would not process all these hearings, they should concentrate on their hourly fee opposed to the number of hearings and whether they can handle one or two court&#160; reporters being available per day. Within what time period will it be known whether the June 26, 2006 start date is firm (as opposed to tentative)?   A.  All dates are tentative until award or awards have been made. 3.&#160; If I'm interpreting the numbers correctly there are approximately 21 hearings a day.&#160; Is that correct?&#160; How many concurrent reporters are required on a daily basis? &#160; On average,  &#160; 5 Central Office hearings per day 12 video hearings per day 12 Waco travel board hearings on the days the Board is conducting such hearings 12 Waco travel board hearings on the days the Board is conducting such hearings &#160; The contractor would not process all these hearings, they should concentrate on their hourly fee opposed to the number of hearings and whether they can handle one or two court&#160; reporters being available per day. &#160; 4.&#160; Does the court reporting contractor sell copies of the transcripts to any of the parties or does BVA supply copies to all the parties?&#160; &#160; Absolutely not, that's&#160;clearly stated in the SOW.&#160; The government is the sole owner and&#160;their privacy &#160; CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE All audiocassette tapes will be returned to the BVA.  Once a transcript is accepted by BVA, the Contractor(s) will purge all paper and electronic systems of the hearing transcript.  The Contractor(s) will not retain any information or personal identifiers that are subject to the Privacy Act. Confidentiality:  The transcriber shall hold in the strictest confidence all information relating to the individuals and issues involved in the BVA proceeding that he/she may gain in the performance of his/her services. The Contractor(s) will ensure that contract personnel have met VA training requirements pertaining to the Privacy Act and VA Cyber Security Awareness, which are available via the VA virtual private network and can be completed in approximately one hour each. &#160; Data Rights:  BVA reserves the right to make additional printed and electronic copies, or portions thereof, of all transcriptions as it deems necessary and the Contractor(s) shall have no claim for additional copies.  &#160; &#160; 5.&#160; I was somewhat unclear on the delivery schedule: &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; Is it the case that for hearings where&#160;one of our&#160;court reporters is present the transcript is due by the end of that same business day?&#160; If so, is there a cut-off time after which the delivery deadline would roll over to the next business day?&#160; (E.g. if a reporter has 6 hearings to do in a day and doesn't&#160;do off the record&#160;until 5:00pm when are the 6 transcripts due?) &#160; A. The last hearing is normally concluded by 4 p.m.&#160;&#160;If the contractor is quote real time recording prices the transcripts will be due by COB.&#160;  &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; B.&#160; If a hearing is conducted by speakerphone with our court reporter here in our office and the parties in their respective offices then the transcript is due in two business days? &#160; A. Yes&#160;  &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; C.&#160; If we are given a recording by BVA to transcribe the transcript is due in 14 calendar days? &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A.  Yes&#160;  &#160;With regard to the On-Site Court Reporting Services or optional speaker phone transcription, would you please verify that the delivery due is the day the service is provided.  A.  The last hearing is normally concluded by 4 p.m.&#160;&#160;If the contractor is quote real time recording prices the transcripts will be due by COB.  Please see other questions below and this may answer your question.  9.&#160; Does DVA pay travel for assignments outside the Washington metropolitan area?&#160; Outside CONUS? &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A.  No, the Government only pays appearance fee for on-site court reporting, no travel expenses.&#160; Contractors in the Waco and St. Petersburg area are available to bid for those assignments. &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  10.&#160; What percentage of work is in the DC office?&#160; What percentage of work is OCONUS? &#160; A. We conduct hearings 5 days a week here in our DC office.&#160; The travel board dates are listed in the SOW. No work will be conducted OCONUS &#160; Who is the current vendor and what are their prices? I will get a name of the Vendor currently performing services however I cannot disclose their prices. I will get the name of the by Monday July 17, 2006 by 4:30p est.  &#160; Would you send me the Q&amp;A from last week? These are all the Q&amp;A's&#160; Would you send a sample format of a transcript? A sample format will be sent to all awardees when awardees have been selected. &#160; What is VETS100?&#160; Must we be registered now or do we register after award?    It is always good to register with VETS-100; however, in this case it is not necessary because one of the exceptions is for commercial Items. How many contracts will you be awarding? A.  That depends on the proposals. &#160; &#160; How will you be evaluating the price proposal?&#160; (i.e. what are the weights for the three delivery requirements?) Technical Factors are more important than price.  Selection of the company to perform this task order will be based on the Government's assessment of the best overall value. I apologize for not getting all of the questions answered but will get answers to the remaining two questions by Monday July 17, 2006. Thanks, Hilbert hilbert.caesar@va.gov
