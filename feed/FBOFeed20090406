<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement to develop a new MFIRE 3.0 based on the old MFIRE 2.20. The MFIRE 3.0 back-end engine will be written in object-oriented, ANSI-compliant C++. It will be structured as a class library that can be re-used to build new simulation programs that need to model mine ventilation and fires. It will have discrete event simulation capabilities that allow mine ventilation and fires to be tracked over time. However, no improvements are requested regarding the underlying ventilation model.
<p>The CDC intends to award a single fixed price contract.</p>
<p>The Statement of Work has a four phase approach including the final report (IV), each of which adds additional capabilities to the model. NIOSH reserves the option to fund any phase combination subject to the availability of funds. Therefore, potential vendors are asked to provide separate time and cost estimates for performing each phase.</p>
<p>A very simple front-end user interface will also be developed that uses the MFIRE 3.0 class library. This front-end will allow validation of the MFIRE library and permit NIOSH to continue to run MFIRE as a standalone program. However, it is expected that third party developers will utilize the MFIRE library to develop more sophisticated front-ends (such as adding graphical capabilities to view and edit the mine network and progression of simulated fires). For this reason, the front-end developed under this contract should be designed to meet only basic needs for testing and running MFIRE simulations. Further, the class library must be designed as public domain software, and must not require third party developers to purchase additional software or software licenses to utilize it.</p>
<p>The RFP will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition and will be<br />issued on or about April 3, 2009, with a 30 day closing. The complete solicitation document, and reference material if applicable will be available electronically at HTTP://FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number 2009-N-11122. Paper copies WILL NOT be available and No telephone requests will be accepted. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site for any updates/amendments. No government-wide notes apply.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, is seeking to procure two (2) Bench Test Sets (BTS) with the capability to perform Intermediate and Depot Level Testing of H-46 Helicopter Dual Extensible Link Actuators. The Extensible Link Actuator (ELA) Bench Test Set is used at the intermediate level to test the Automatic Flight Control System Extensible Link Actuator. The test set performs fault isolation of the actuator to the defective replaceable part.  The current ELA Bench Test was developed and fielded in the mid-1980's, but has several obsolete components.  As part of the Geriatric Aircraft Safety and Sustainment Program (GASSP) Reliability Abbreviated Acquisition Program (AAP), the Navy plans to field a replacement test set to sustain our current maintenance philosophy for the remaining life cycle of the H-46.  It is the intent of the Government to negotiate and award an order with a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) line item for the non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort under existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Ridley Park, PA and will be made using Boeing proprietary drawings that define the tanks, the self-sealing covering, and all critical manufacturing processes.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the H-46 series helicopter and retains exclusive proprietary rights to all technical data.  The Boeing Company is the only firm that possesses the knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and technical data required to perform these efforts.  Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with The Boeing Company, Route 291 & Stewart Ave., Ridley Park, PA 19078-1099. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Due to mission related needs of the agency, the location is required to be as close as possible to 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD based on the following; 9800 Medical Center currently houses the agencys research, scientists and a Kalypsys Integrated Screening System robotic equipment custom made to the agencys specifications, valued at approximately $30 million dollars, needed to fulfill this new space request requirement.  The collaboration of these scientists, the current collaborative research, the robotic equipment and the expertise to run this equipment are presently located at 9800 Medical Center Drive in 59,662 rentable square feet and will not be moved.

Collaboration between NIH scientists that will be housed in the space to be acquired with respect to this advertisement and those NIH scientists located at 9800 Medical Center Drive is mission critical.

Construction and installation of items below the ceiling plane (Fume hoods, casework, finishes other than ceiling, waist piping etc.) will be the Governments expense.

The laboratory space must be ready for occupancy by July 1, 2010. 

Offerors should note that in its price evaluation, the Government will consider the total value of improvements and/or laboratory equipment/fixtures that are included in each offerors proposal that meets the tenant agencys requirements.  The value of any improvements and/or laboratory equipment/fixtures that meets the Governments requirements will be considered in the price evaluation in order to reduce the overall cost to the Government to build out and occupy the space. 

The building must be located outside of any 100-year floodplain.  Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current Federal, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA. 

In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.

<DESC>A 21-acre island will be constructed by placing geotextile containers on the river bottom (in 1 to 5 feet of water) around the perimeter of the proposed island footprint.  The geotextile containers will be filled with fine-grained river bottom sediments utilizing a high-solids dredging technique that will be proposed by the Contractor.  The river bottom material will be excavated in a manner to create a channel of prescribed depth and side slopes around the entire constructed island for fish habitat.  During excavation, the contractor should anticipate encountering debris, and will separate and remove all debris from the project site.  Once the geotextile containers are filled to the prescribed height, additional dredged material will be placed within the island footprint utilizing the same high-solids method.  Erosion protection stone will also be placed adjacent to the geotextile containers in defined areas.  Lastly, a test section is required, which will consist of constructing a second layer of geotextile containers stacked on top of the first layer.  The contract will require up to 125,000 cubic yards of material in one construction season utilizing the approved high-solids dredging technique.  The contractor will also be required to provide a boat and field office for the Government to utilize for quality assurance activities.   The interior of the island will be filled to finished grade under a separate contract (Stage 2).<BR><BR>Estimated Order of Magnitude for this project:	$1,000,000 to $5,000,000<BR><BR>Plans and Specs will be available on or about 17 November 2008.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The United States Air Force Test Pilot School, Edwards AFB, CA, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to provide pilot, instruction, and North American/Rockwell "T-2" Buckeye aircraft, for the USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) to support the Qualitative Evaluation (qual-eval) Program (QE 900). Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources. The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources. Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience.
<p>1.1 General. Contractor shall provide pilot, instruction, Out of Control Flight (OCF) training plan and aircraft, for the USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) to support the Qualitative Evaluation (qual-eval) Program (QE 900). A written copy of the OCF training plan shall be submitted by contractor and approved by TPS Program Manager prior to contract award.</p>
<p>1.2 Qualitative Evaluation Sorties. Format for the qual-eval sorties will be for the safety/instructor pilot to occupy a pilot station while pilot and/or non-pilot students occupy another pilot station. Student and staff pilots will be afforded the opportunity within safety constraints to takeoff and land with a qualified Contractor pilot at another set of flight controls. Non-pilot students and staff crew members will have access to a fully functional set of flight controls and will perform hands-on flying within the limits established by the qualitative review board (QRB), see TPS Operating Instruction OI 11-5 which contains guidance and limits established by the USAF Test Pilot School and is coordinated with the contractor.</p>
<p>1.2.1 Number of Students. Approximately twenty two (22) staff and/or student test pilots/engineers or navigators shall fly the aircraft per class session. One class is required. The number of persons on board the aircraft at one time will not exceed the number of approved seats. The number of students/staff on board the aircraft will be determined by the TPS Program Manager and will be coordinated with the contractor.</p>
<p>1.2.2 Sortie Duration. Scheduled sortie duration will be determined by the qual-eval program manager. Total flight time in support of the qual-eval program will be the number of scheduled sorties multiplied by the scheduled sortie duration. Contractor shall report deviations from scheduled sortie duration to the TPS Program Manager at the conclusion of each sortie.</p>
<p>1.2.3 Number of Qual-Eval Sorties. The number of qual-eval sorties is estimated to be 15-20 student sorties and 2 staff sorties.</p>
<p>1.2.4 Target Qual Eval Date is 18 May 2009 - 29 May 2009. Duration is estimated to be two weeks with one aircraft. Schedule deviations must be approved by TPS Program Manager in advance due to limited scheduling opportunities with class 2008B.</p>
<p>1.3 Location of Operations. When TPS personnel are conducting landings or takeoffs, the primary runway will be Edwards AFB runway 22/04 unless a runway at Palmdale, Fox Airfield, Mojave or other operating location is deemed more suitable by the TPS Program Manager. Additionally, lakebed landings and/or takeoffs may be accomplished IAW AFFTC instructions and operating restrictions.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for Iraq Hazardous Waste (HW) Third-Country Disposal
<SOLNBR>SP4520-09-S-0002
<RESPDATE>041709
<CONTACT>Jon Machacek, Mr., Email jon.machacek@dla.mil - Cindy Fellows, Contracting Officer, Email cindy.fellows@dla.mil
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  DRMS is exploring a variety of alternatives for the disposal of DoD hazardous waste items currently located in Iraq.  As one possible alternative, this announcement is for the purposes of identifying sources capable of conducting removal, export, and disposal of an estimated 20 million pounds of hazardous waste generated by the DoD in Iraq.  Using this scenario, DRMS envisions a contractor physically removing hazardous waste from U.S. military installations within Iraq for transport to disposal facilities outside of the Iraq.  Should this alternative be realized, the end result anticipated would be a five-year, firm-fixed priced contract with a guaranteed minimum.  DRMS projects a very large initial shipment of an estimated 600 military 20-foot sea van containers for removal, export, and disposal, followed by an estimated 25 to 50 sea van containers annually thereafter.  All such waste would be containerized and shipped by the contractor according to ADR and IMDG standards and all other applicable codes, laws, treaties, and so forth.  The contractor would be responsible for coordination and obtaining all necessary clearances and permits including Basel.

Required services would include, but not be limited to, the following:

	Verifying shipments against stated inventories
	Repackaging of waste 
	Completing waste profiles and required manifests and/or other shipping documentation
	Arranging for interim storage of the waste, as necessary
	Coordinating for permits and necessary export documentation including Basel
	Transporting the waste from U.S. military installations to interim storage and/or final disposal facilities
	Disposing of the waste at qualified Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) 

Forms of waste include but are not limited to:

	A variety of used and unused batteries (including lithium)
	Solvents
	Decontaminate agents and kits
	Solid waste containing heavy metals
	Mercury and mercury containing items
	Pesticides/herbicides/fungicides/insecticides
	Waste oil and fuel
	Grease
	PoL contaminated solids 
	Filters
	Aerosol cans and other compressed gas cylinders
	Asbestos items
	Fire extinguishing residue
	Uncontrolled medicine
	Ethylene Glycol
	Spill residue
	Empty containers that previously held hazardous contents

The purpose of this request for information is twofold:  1) to identify the feasibility of such a contract, given the potential concerns and difficulties expected to be encountered by contractors when performing such a project in Iraq; and 2) to identify the capability and interest of any firms with regard to such a project for inclusion on a potential source list in the event a solicitation is pursued in the future.  

This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotations (RFQ)) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in a response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding partys expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. 

Responses are requested in electronic format, either in Microsoft Word or Abode Acrobat format.  All information submitted will be reviewed; however, DRMS may not respond to any submissions.  Information must be submitted not later than 16:30 local time on 17 April 2009, and e-mailed to the attention of Jon Machacek, Contracting Officer, at jon.machacek@dla.mil.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing two portable tunable laser-based radiometric calibration systems for remote sensing sensors. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for two (2) portable tunable laser-based calibration systems for advanced radiometry that would meet the following requirements:

1.	The laser systems must be capable of covering the spectral range from 210 nm to 3000 nm with at least 10 mW of optical power from 210 nm to 240 nm, at least 100 mW from 240 nm to 300 nm, at least 200 mW from 360 nm to 480 nm, at least 300 mW from 520 nm to 1000 nm, and at least 100 mW from 1000 nm to 3000 nm.  The laser system repetition rate must be at least 70 MHz and the spectral resolution must be commensurate with a 1-2 psec laser source. It is desired that the laser system be computer controllable.  It is desired that the entire system fit on a 4 foot by 6 foot optical table.  Training in the operation of the laser system(s) is required.

2.  The laser systems must be fiber-optically coupled into artifacts including integrating spheres and collimators for both radiance responsivity and irradiance responsivity calibrations.  The systems should match the field-of-view/optical system geometry of a nominal sensor to be calibrated.

3.  Associated electronics and data acquisition tools are required with the system, including, but not limited to, wavemeter, shutter, data logger, transfer standard irradiance and radiance meters, transimpedance amplifiers, electronic ruler, and actuator controller.  All equipment must be controllable through Ethernet using LabView software. It is desired to have LabView drivers for all equipment.

4.	A broadband spectrally tunable validation source is required.  The output of  the source must be coupled into a fiber bundle or liquid light guide with a 1 mm diameter.  The source spectral power density coupled into a 1 mm diameter fiber bundle or liquid light guide must be least 1 mW/nm from 450 nm to 2400 nm.  An extended spectral range from 300 nm to 400nm with  spectral power density of approximately 0.5 mW/nm is desired.  The ability to change the relative spectral distribution of the source to match a user-defined spectral distribution with approximately 5 nm spectral resolution is desired.

<DESC>NIST is seeking information on three categories of neutron imaging detectors: a high resolution, large field of view detector; a large area charge coupled device (CCD) with a fiber optic coupling to a neutron scintillator; and a high frame rate imaging detector.  We anticipate that each imaging system will have several components and maybe retrofitted from use with X-rays or other forms of light to use with neutrons.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for systems that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct competitive procurements and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to use Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirements.

Please include a description of these components and all necessary equipment in order to have a complete user-instrument.  We seek information on detector systems that may meet the following desired targets for one or more of each category of detector system:

1.	High resolution, large field of view detector with nominal characteristics:
a.	A field of view that is about 10 cm by 10 cm
b.	A detector spatial resolution less than 15 micrometers
c.	A thermal neutron (neutron energy of 25 meV) detection efficiency of about 15 % or greater
d.	If an event counting detector, then the dead time should be minimized and capable of handling a neutron fluence rate of 2106 cm-2 s-1 over the entire field of view
e.	Neutron sensitive portion can be exchanged with minimal change to the detector

2.	Large area, fiber optic coupled CCD camera with nominal characteristics:
a.	A pixel pitch about or less then 10 micrometers
b.	A single chip pixel array at least 8000 pixels by 8000 pixels
c.	Cooling to below -60 C (absolute, not differential) to achieve dark current of less than 0.005 e/pixel/sec
d.	A fiber optic coupling mechanism within a 45 to 90 degree bend, to place the camera at least 10 cm outside the center of the field of view
e.	The end of the fiber optic to be either a variable taper to allow 1:1, 2:1, or other magnification/minification tapers
f.	A means to couple and exchange a neutron scintillator to the taper
g.	A readout rate of about 1 MHz or better

3.	High frame rate imaging detector with nominal characteristics:
a.	Detector image spatial resolution about 0.3 mm or better
b.	A large field of view in the range of 10 cm by 10 cm to 25 cm by 25 cm, with a preference for the larger field of view, which can be achieved with a large format detector or a scintillator with a fiber optic taper
c.	A high frame rate, greater than 100 Hz
d.	A thermal neutron (neutron energy of 25 meV) detection efficiency of about 15 % or greater  
e.	If an event counting detector, then the dead time should be minimized and capable of handling an event fluence rate of 5  107 cm-2 s-1

<CONTACT>Derek M. Davis , Contract Specialist, Phone 3014968505, Email Derek.Davis@nih.gov - Silver C Jones, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-4487, Fax 301-402-0178, Email sj12z@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R & D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement.

Background: The Human Genetic Cell Repository was established by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in 1972 to collect cell samples from patients with genetic disorders and to establish and distribute cell lines derived from the samples to researchers.  The Repository's primary function was to serve the genetics community by both stimulating and facilitating research efforts.  It was expected to stimulate research by encouraging investigators, through the easy availability of high quality material, to try a new technique or to test a new hypothesis with human cells which could otherwise not be done due to a lack of clinical facilities or of an appropriate patient population.  The Repository was expected to facilitate research by providing high quality, uncontaminated, well-characterized, and clinically well-documented cell lines to investigators throughout the U.S. and abroad.  

Purpose and Objectives: The proposed project is a continuation of the Human Genetic Cell Repository funded by the contract HHS-N-260-2005-00001-C.  The Human Genetic Cell Repository is a unique resource designed to provide investigators with cell lines from patients with a wide variety of genetic disorders and from normal individuals, as well as other cell lines useful for genetic studies.  The Repository also prepares and distributes DNA derived from selected cell lines.  To provide these cell lines and DNA samples, the Repository acquires appropriate cell samples, establishes cell lines from them, characterizes and stores the cell lines, extracts and stores DNA samples from cell lines, maintains a comprehensive computerized database, advertises the availability of the cell lines and DNA samples, and distributes them to investigators upon request.  During the next contract period the Repository will continue to perform essentially the same tasks but will increase its efforts in the establishment, maintenance, and distribution of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and differentiated cells, and will offer certain services related to providing cell cultures and DNA samples.

Project requirements: The work to be supported by this contract includes five separate but interrelated tasks:

1.  The collection of new cell samples, the establishment and characterization of permanent cell lines from these samples, and the maintenance and distribution of both newly established cell lines and cell lines already in the Repository's collection.

2.  The preparation, storage, and distribution of purified, high-quality DNA samples from selected cell lines in the Repository. 

3.  The provision of additional genetic services and distribution of other reagents.  

4.  The maintenance of a comprehensive computerized database providing detailed information on each cell line and DNA sample, and the provision of a Web-based electronic catalog that continues, at a minimum, to list cell lines and DNA samples and as much information about them in as easily accessible a form as is currently available.

5.  The publicizing of the Repository's collections through distribution of information by a variety of means, publication of descriptions of the collections in relevant journals, paid advertisements, and other activities.

Please see the attached Statement of Work for further details including the required reports/deliverables.

Anticipated period of performance: The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014.

Other important considerations: The Government intends to award a Cost-Reimbursement, Completion type contract.

Capability statement/information sought: Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement that includes the following:

1. Information regarding respondents: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information;

2. Respondents DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.

Information submission instructions: Respondents should submit one (1) copy of their capability statement, not to exceed 20 pages, to the attention of: Derek Davis, Contract Specialist, OD/OLAO, via email to Derek.Davis@nih.gov.  Please send all responses in an electronic Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format, using a 10 or 12 point font size.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM EST, April 21, 2009.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The purpose of this announcement is to Request for Information (RFI) on non-magnetic or low magnetic characteristic alkaline batteries in "D-cell" form factor.
SCOPE: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division is seeking information on commercial availability of alkaline batteries with low-magnetic properties, preferably non-magnetic properties.  Form factor should be the standard "D-cell." (a.k.a. LR20)  Typical commercial-off-the-shelf alkaline batteries are encased in steel jacket housing, this results in a strong and varying magnetic moment that is troublesome to deal with.  A comparable alkaline battery in the same form factor and typical power sourcing capability is sought that minimizes this magnetic effect from the steel components.  We'd be interested in learning about any power sources in the same form factor meeting MIL-DTL-19595 specifications also.  
This is part of an Analysis of Alternatives study. Descriptive information is sought in the form of white papers, brochures, specification sheets, briefings, and company points of contact.   Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time; this request for Information/Sources Sought announcement may not directly lead to a request for proposals. 
RESPONSES: Interested parties are encouraged to provide relevant past experience, personnel skills, capabilities and abilities. Supporting literature and documentation that demonstrates depth of knowledge may be included in addition to the three-page narrative paper. Questions and response to this notice must be submitted by email to marlene.davidson1@navy.mil no later than 4:00 PM CST, 17 April 2009. Technical Questions must be directed to Robert Parker, e-mail: robert.h.parker1@navy.mil (Please note the "1" after the "r" in parker.) Naval Surface Warfare Panama City Division, Code A13 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407. 
This announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (OCT 1997) and is published only to encourage interested parties to gather information about commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed below.<BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR>1.  SUBJECT:  The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on technology solutions for Video Assisted Intubation Devices (VAID) suitable for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) use aboard fixed-wing aircraft.  Responses are due to this Request for Information (RFI) by Wednesday, May 6, 2009; 4:00 PM EDT.<BR>2.  DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Information and representative samples as responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, AFMESA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future Request for Proposal (RFP).<BR>3. BACKGROUND: The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Air Mobility Command (AMC) has identified a need for a VAID for use in AE missions undertaken by Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT). That need has been manifested in the patient airway changes that can occur during the AE mission, as well as the severity of injury and the difficulty of intubation given the patients position, the narrow spaces in which the caregivers have to maneuver, and limited approaches to the patients airway during flight.  Specifically, caregivers require visual access to the patients airway to ensure proper placement of airway tubing that, due to physical limitations aboard an aircraft or due to spinal injury, is difficult to accomplish with traditional intubation devices.  The VAID will be used in non-standard medical environments with variable weather and lighting conditions.  The device will also be used to establish an airway in patients with difficult or problematic breathing conditions.<BR>4.  REQUIREMENTS: The VAID solution will provide a cost-effective, portable method for viewing the vocal cords, including any endotracheal tubing already in place.  It will also assist in the initial placement of breathing tubes for patients with difficult airways.  The VAID tool will grant medical providers a method for observation of airways in patients placed in various physical positions.  This includes those placed higher, lower, or at differing angles than those found in the standard hospital environment.  The VAID solution must be able to be used in-flight in all Air Force (AF) mobility aircraft without disruption.  This includes disruption of the aircrafts flight, as well as the visual images presented by the device.

<DESC><p><span>THIS
IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT
WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <span>&nbsp;</span>This notice does not constitute a solicitation
and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government
will not reimburse the costs incurred by potential contractors in providing the
information requested herein.</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Lab Products, Inc. of Seaford, DE for 25 specialized nonhuman primate caging for the Division of Veterinary Resources (DVR) in the Office of Research Services (ORS). The rationale for this Intention to Sole Source can be found in FAR 6.302-1: "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>NAICS Code is 339999 - All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing<br />Federal Supply Classification is 6640 - Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.</p>
<p>The new caging will replace older, damaged caging and caging that no longer conforms to current housing/environmental enrichment standards and requirements.  The caging will also provide housing for new research requirements.  Products available from interested vendors need to match the requirements/specifications and provide interchangeability with similar items previously acquired from Lab Products, Inc. as stated below.</p>
<p>Requirements/Specifications:<br />Interchangeability with existing racking systems which are Lab Products Part No. Primate Unit, Stainless Steel Mobile (4) (97 are currently in use). Standardization of caging systems in multiple primate facilities use Lab Products Part No. Primate Unit, Stainless Steel Mobile (4). Cage racks shall not exceed seventy-nine (79) inches for animal room door clearance. Cage rack components shall be compatible with Lab Products Part Number, Primate Unit, Stainless Steel Mobile (4),</p>
<p>The cages shall meet or exceed current USDA requirements for housing primates at 10-15 kilograms. Primate units shall have four compartments with a minimum size of 6.0 square feet of floor space and inside height of 32 inches. Primate units shall be made of materials that are completely autoclavable at high temperatures (270 F). The construction of primate units shall be made of heavy duty stainless steel and the design shall facilitate ease of sanitation that eliminates the need for mechanical scrubbing. The construction shall be seamless as possible with minimal amounts of welded constructions so they will not trap organic matter. The primate units shall incorporate a design to provide enrichment to include solid stainless steel panels, grid panels and high impact Zyfone<sup>TM</sup>.  The design shall have a 5 tiered system. The unit shall be designed with removable interior panels to provide socialization of animals from side to side and from top to bottom. Waste pans shall be of seamless construction and sloped shall nest in such a manner as not to become stuck together.  They shall be made of high temperature plastic to withstand repeated washing at a minimum of 180 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>All parts of the primate units shall be constructed to withstand repeated shaking and high impacts caused by non-human primates. Primate units shall provide a safe and secure environment for non-human primates. The squeeze-back mechanism shall have a design that does not trap debris, organic matter and provides a high level of safety by eliminating pinch points to the non-human primate's appendages.  Primate units shall be equipped with Edstrom stainless steel automatic water system. The quick disconnect and recoil hose shall be located in an area that eliminates the potential for animals being able to access and break the parts. The units shall have locking mechanisms and latches that are tamper proof by non-human primates and prevents escaped animals. The feeders shall be designed to eliminate the ability of non-human primates to reach out and possibly injure employees. Cage doors shall slide to side when opening and closing and not a guillotine style door. Cage doors shall slide to side when opening and closing and not a guillotine style door.</p>
<p>Lab Products, Inc.<br />DVR has purchased racks from Lab Products in the past 8 years to systematically replace caging and to standardize the caging in all primate facilities.</p>
<p>There are times that require relocation of primate cages among the various DVR primate facilities both in Bethesda and the Poolesville Facilities and all non-human primate racks must adhere to this standard for interchangeability.  Also, racks exceeding the height of 79 inches do not fit through the doors in the 14 Group facilities or animal transportation vehicles.  Lab Products racks are built to this standard.</p>
<p>The primate racks are routinely sanitized to maintain a clean environment that is conducive to good animal health.  Weekly sanitation of the caging is a requirement to maintain AAALAC accreditation.  The sanitation process exposes the animal racks to high temperatures and chemical exposure that requires the use of heavy-duty stainless steel.  The design of the Lab Products cage facilitates ease of sanitation and eliminates the need for mechanical scrubbing by providing seamless panels and fewer areas for organic dirt to be trapped.</p>
<p>During cage changing it is imperative that animals do not escape.  The method of cage changing requires that one empty, sanitized unit be placed in front of a soiled unit with animals inside the cages.  The doors of each cage are opened and animals are "jumped" from the soiled cage to the sanitized cage.  For the safety of the animals and animal care staff the cages and doors must be aligned exactly.  Variations in the dimensions of caging systems in the past have led to escaped animals and every precaution must be taken to prevent this from reoccurring.  Purchasing primate units of the same type and dimensions as our existing Lab Products units significantly minimizes the risk of escaping animals and possibly injuring themselves or the care staff.</p>
<p>A major goal of the DVR Environmental Enrichment Program is to have the ability to safely pair or group house animals.  Lessons have been learned over the years that specific steps must be taken to carefully and systematically introduce animals to one another.  The DVR Behaviorist through years of observations and tests has determined that a five tiered system inside the cages will successfully and safely help to reach the goal of group housing.  This system can prevent animals from injuring each other with bites, scratches, lacerations and lost digits.  Cages need to be equipped with four separate socialization panels that can be manipulated by animal care staff from outside the cage.  Lab Products caging has this tiered system incorporated into their design of primate racks.</p>
<p>Interested parties are required to review the above requirements and submit a statement of interest which includes: itemized firm fixed price costs and documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Governments requirements. The submission is due at 3:00 pm, Monday April 13, 2009. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Duns &amp; Bradstreet (Duns) number, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the vendor's business size.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source contract for services of a Physicist (40 hours per week), Dosimetrist (40 hours per week) and an Implant technician (24 hours per month) to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  A fixed price contract with a base of April 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009 was awarded.  It is the Governments belief that only Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 6.302-1VA241-P-1158PHYSICIST, DOSEMETRIST AND IMPLANT TECHNICIAN SOLE SOURCE AWARD1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:  The agency is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The activity is the Boston VA Medical Center.Solicitation # VA-241-09-RQ-0184 Contract # VA241-P-1158.2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a Physicist, Dosimetrist and Implant Technician. 3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):  Radiation Therapy at the VA Boston Healthcare System-Jamaica Plain Campus, requires expert Physicist, Dosimetrist and Implant Technician for various VA external beam, radiation therapy, and brachytherapy services.  The estimated value of this service is $260,362.08.4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Law Title 38 USC sections 8151-8153.5.  Demonstration of the contractors unique qualifications:  Because of the high level of specialized expertise required, the contractors will be hired under a sole source contract. Radiation Therapy Service requires contractors with substantiative knowledge of external beam and brachytherapy procedures as well as experience in and understanding of the VA healthcare system.  Also, contractors who can lead and produce a product of high quality.   Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is a Harvard University teaching facility that provides a high quality of patient care and is also leading the industry in new technologies for external beam and brachytherapy services.   This medical center has also collaborated with the VA for the past 8 years and understands the unique needs of the veteran population and the delivery of healthcare services to veterans.   The contractors will work closely and participate with the staff on the planning, simulations, implant surgeries, inspections, quality assurance and review of archival data material, data analysis, and report development.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.2 applies:  This solicitation will not be posted prior to award because of an exception at FAR 6.302 applies.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-5(a) 2 Authorized or required by statute, this procurement is under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Law Title 38 USC sections 8151-8153.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:  The proposed price for individuals with this level of education, expertise, and related experience is fair and reasonable.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:  According to the national benchmarks set by the American College of Radiation Oncology and guidelines in the community, each Radiation Oncology department must be manned by a physicist and dosimetrist.  If brachytherapy is utilized, an implant technician must also be on hand for patient care and quality review on a daily basis.  Nationally, there is more of a demand for physicists, dosimetrists, and implant technicians than supply.  Due to these circumstances, the VA has had extreme difficulty recruiting qualified candidates for the positions.  Another factor contributing to the difficulty in recruiting candidates is the competitive salary offered physicists, dosimetrists, and implant technicians in the New England region.  If the VA is unable to treat radiation therapy patients at their location, then the VA will have to contract the services out to community hospitals at a much higher expense.  Also, contracting services out will not provide the continuum of care to the VA patient population.  A review of other hospitals in the Boston area found no sources available that can provide the services expressed in sections 2 and 5.  Tufts University does not provide contracted physicist, dosimetrist, or implant technician services.   9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available:  Requirements for radiation therapy endeavors are very specific in nature and frequently there is only one responsible source.  There is little the agency could do to open this requirement to competition.  This is procurement under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Title38 USC sections 8151-8153.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  None to date.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  This acquisition is truly a sole source requirement and there were no barriers to competition to remove.  This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

<DESC>Justification for other than Full and Open CompetitionEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.303-2, each justification shall include the following information:  1. Requesting Agency: 	   U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)		           VA Central Office     Contracting activity:   VA Center for Acquisition Innovation                           1615 Woodward Street                           Austin, TX 78772 2. Nature and/or description of the action: The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Central Office (VACO) supports about 7000 users, and 17,000+ computers in 17 buildings in the Washington DC Metropolitan area with a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) that includes the Capitol Area Network (CAN). This network currently supports voice, video, and data traffic. The Office of Information Technology (OI&T), Information Technology Services organization in VACO is responsible for providing MAN connectivity throughout this campus. Connectivity is provided for all Administration and staff offices connected to these networks that service many different business processes to serve the Veteran.Applied Data Systems (ADS) is the incumbent service provider on contract VA200-P-0066. This contract is set to expire on 04/30/2009.  This J&A is for a six (6) month sole-source contract with ADS to maintain service coverage during Global Information Technology Support Services (GITSS) RFP competition process. The competition process is expected to cover the six (6) month period in case transition of contractors is required.   3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):    Contractor shall continue the current level of service and availability already provided on dark fiber optic cable (both 3rd party and VA owned) and provide the changes as specified.  The VA will improve and modify this infrastructure as the VAs connectivity needs change. The MAN must continue to be a robust transmission infrastructure that is secure, redundant, and considered the best of class in the fiber optic transmission industry, with all aspects complying with current industry standards.  These networks must support the VA and all systems associated with its missions and any Government Partnership missions.  The services required are composed of the following major components:1.	Support the current topology2.	Provide specified changes3.	Provide, install, maintain fiber optic links4.	Provide, install, configure and maintain equipment5.	Maintain and repair all aspects of the equipment and network considered herein6.	Propose topology, design, or equipment changes that increase the availability or flexibility of the MAN.Contractor shall maintain the MAN in a way that meets the VAs goals of high bandwidth, high availability, manageability, scalability, supporting multiple protocols, with a multiple-service network infrastructure transmitting voice, data, and video traffic.  Contractor shall supply the design, engineering, fiber optic cable, equipment, equipment racks, installation, maintenance, and supplies for each deliverable in a turnkey solution.The MAN is defined by the Layer 1 OEO equipment manufactured by ADVA Optical Networking (was Movaz Networks) in a dual head-end design.  The contractor shall supply the design, engineering, fiber optic cable, equipment, equipment racks, installation, maintenance, and supplies for each deliverable in a turnkey solution.The estimated value of this requirement for the six (6) month period is $xxxxx 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.     The statutory authority of this justification is FAR 6.302-1 Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The only firm able to meet VA requirements is Applied Data Systems.  VA presently has a maintenance contract (VA200-P-0066) with Applied Data Systems, which supports the existing MAN systems.  To avoid expiring service issues, the systems must be maintained during the RFP process.  The MAN must be maintained during the GITSS RFP competition process to avoid service interruptions.  In the event of service interruptions it is estimated the Government would incur costs of $400,000.00 per hour in lost labor due to information technology (IT) networks downtime.  These IT network downtimes are unacceptable possibilities and would cause significant injury and detriment to the VA and impede mission objectives severely.  The RFP process is estimated to cover a six (6) month period (including four (4) month transition period as required).  6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This justification will be posted in FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2. 7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The anticipated costs of $xxxxx associated with this requirement are fair and reasonable based on the Independent Government Cost Estimate.8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research was not conducted regarding this requirement due to this action being a sole-source requirement.  9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.  No other supporting information available. 10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.    Applied Data Systems has expressly provided interest in this requirement.  11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  The follow on contract to this requirement will be competed using the Department of Veterans Affairs  Global Information Technology Support Services (GITSS) contract.  12. Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).  I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Governments minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  =/s/David Ponder_________________________             _____04/01/2009________Signature of Technical/Requirements                    Representative                                         Date This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.  /s/Jeff Bishop_________________________                ___04/03/2009________Contracting Officer                                     Date Procurements over $500,000 require approval from Competition Advocate.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionRequesting Agency: 	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)	Education Service (EDU) Regional Processing Offices (RPOs)Atlanta, Georgia (GA)Buffalo, New York (NY)Muskogee, Oklahoma (OK)St. Louis, Missouri (MO) Contracting Activity:Department of Veterans AffairsInformation Technology Acquisition Center (200/00D)Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin (CAI-A)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772A bilateral modification (SA #01) for Contract: GS-06F-0532Z, Task Order: V200-P-1879 is required for additional work in order to complete the Work Study Management System (WSMS) project which was delayed. The source of the delays was the unanticipated complications that arose due to limited Office Information and Technology (OI&T) and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) experience on how to efficiently coordinate business and Information Technolgoy (IT) during the development of new applications into the existing VBA Corporate environment, and the new VA OI&T Web Architecture Standards.Critical issues began arising regarding access to VA Corporate Database (CORP DB) to gather, update, and change information. There was disagreement among VA business lines as to which systems have the authority to add/update as well as which system is the authoritative source when data differences are encountered. Meetings with various VA groups, including Office of Business Process Integration (OBPI) and Education Service (EDU), continued from April 2008 through November 2008. A solution for using common shared tables and services to allow WSMS to 'add', 'edit', or 'update' Persons Tables in the CORP DB was never reached.  Therefore, this seriously impacted the ability to finalize the software development, testing, documentation and training within the firm fixed price budget and schedule.The decision delay prevented fully developing code to deal with the insert or update of 'Person' records.  Without this ability, new student records cannot be added and changes cannot be made to any existing student records.Lacking requested direction from VA on how to interface with VA Corporate database, VETS, Inc. developed an internal WSMS capability to add or modify records. VETS, Inc. must now document the requirements, re-design, develop, test and implement an interface (including update of required documentation) with VA Corporate database.Modification: $334,437.56FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii) order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contractor, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. VETS, Inc. has been working on this task order for the past eighteen (18) months. It has completed the majority of the deliverables and they have established a working relationship with the various VA teams (i.e. OBPI, EDU, Veterans Benefit Information Technology (VBIT), SHARE, DA, Enterprise Arch and Flight On the Job Training Correspondence Apprentice System (FOCAS)). VETS, Inc. has been actively involved in the critical thinking and problem solving meetings. It is extremely familiar with the project, with issues, and with how to solve the issues. It has been instrumental in providing solutions. Therefore, this modification allows for continued work and anticipates completion of the Work Study Management System development. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Therefore, VETS is the only source that will satisfy the needs of VA needs in a cost effective and timely manner.A notice of the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is publicized on FedBizOpps. The proposed prices were based on previously-negotiated prices under a current government contract which are already determined to be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer evaluated the other cost or price elements that the contractor proposed in addition to the labor rates that were based on the VETS GWAC contract.  Both the new and modified tasks & deliverables are an integral part of the ongoing effort.  When the solution to the 'Person' table problem was created, it was predicated on what already existed or was in process and could be extended or modified as part of the current effort so as to minimize the cost to the government. When architecting the solution the VA had two major objectives, first to expedite providing the Education Service with a workable solution and second to minimize costs.  Due to these reasons, the solution was designed to be an integral part of the current effort being performed by the existing contactor and therefore, market research was not conducted.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI)<br />The Directors Small Business Set-Aside Initiative</strong></p>
<p>1. Background: The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has identified several tasks that are both critical to the Agency's mission as well as being suited for qualified Small Businesses. The tasks are designed to be finite in nature, have actionable deliverables, and, when appropriate, define future courses of action and associated costs for future, follow on efforts. Five tasks have been identified to date and the Agency is requesting input from small business concerns regarding potential sources and their capabilities. Listed below is a short synopsis of each task.</p>
<p>&bull;	Support to Irregular Warfare: Define the role and processes of the Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center in support of the Secretary of Defense Irregular Warfare initiative. Period of Performance, 6 months.  <br />&bull;	Collection Management Enterprise Baseline Assessment:  Conduct an assessment of the DoD Collection Management operating environment with the goal of recommending improvements to enhance interoperability and improving support to intelligence operations. Period of performance, 6 months.<br />&bull;	MASINT Enterprise Architecture: Baseline the requirements for a net-centric MASINT Enterprise Architecture. Develop and deploy a web based tool to manage MASINT requirements. Period of performance, 1 Year.<br />&bull;	Defense Intelligence Enterprise Management:  Working directly with DIA senior management, develop a set of common standards, metrics, and policies designed to create a common culture across the agency. Period of performance, 1 year.<br />&bull;	DIOCC Strategy to Task (S2T):  Develop a S2T Enterprise process to support the Combatant Commands and mission partners. Create a DIOCC and STRATCOM IT baseline. Period of Performance, 1 year.</p>
<p><br />2. Should the Agency decide to move forward with these efforts, they anticipate releasing separate solicitations for each.  DIA anticipates these efforts would be awarded on a predominately Firm Fixed Price (FPP) basis. Companies interested in responding to this RFI may submit separate responses for any or all efforts. Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above. This information should include a description of the company, their areas of expertise, and contact information.</p>
<p>3. The deadline for this submission of information is 20 April 2009 at 1430hrs. Information should be provided via electronic mail to Ms. Sherry Baldwin at sherry.baldwin@dia.mil. Responses are limited to 4 pages for each task.</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE AN ORDER/CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. AG-64PP-S-09-AA02 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees or less.  The USDA, ARS, MWA, Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO has a requirement/need for a company to provide custom microarray design, manufacture, hybridization, and data analysis for the grass Sporobolus stapfianus and the resurrection club moss Selaginella lepidophylla.   Custom arrays are needed that are synthesized on a Maskless Array Synthesizer utilizing light directed synthesis.  This dramatically reduces the cost and allows greater flexibility during the manufacturing process compared with photolithographic technologies that use photoresist masks.  In addition, the arrays should contain probe sets between 3-12 per gene model and be of 60 nucleotides in length.  This provides much greater reproducibility than printed microarrays that contain only a single probe sequence per oligonucleotide and the length provides optimal detection of low abundance transcripts. For gene expression analysis, long oligos (60mer) provide superior signal-to-noise ratio, increased sensitivity, specificity, and discrimination, particularly in complex eukaryotic genomes. Another significant advantage is that such long probes eliminate the need for mismatch probes, effectively doubling array capacity. The array must be flexible to accommodate 1 x 385,000 features per array.  Feature size must be between 13 x 13 m or 16 x 16 m. This will allow 12 tiles to be manufactured per slide.  For our analysis of >50,000 genes for both Sporobolus and Selaginella, we will require at least 385,000 features per array and 12 arrays per slide to be cost effective.  The research scientist requires that in replicate hybridization experiments, inter-array r2 values routinely exceed 0.98. The array must also include a series of controls elements that consist of Dynamic Range, Limit of Detection, Base-Specific Synthesis Parameters and Uniformity. In addition, the manufacturer must allow us to include our own set of custom controls at no extra cost. We will require the ability to do approximately 30 hybridizations per species array and will require the flexibility to use either RNA or cDNA as a source material for probes.

Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price or contract unit price labor rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date.<br />(g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.<br />(End of Clause)<br />AFFAR clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug, 2005) is applicable to this acquisition along with the following addenda:</p>

<p>Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) (See Note I) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I. (1) Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term (See Note ii) contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:(a) Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />(b) Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />&copy; Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />-- High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />-- Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />-- Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />(d) The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />(1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />(2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />(3) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note iii)<br />(4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />(5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) (See Note iv) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). (e) Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the FBI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />(2) Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a.and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />(a) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />(b) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />&copy; Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note v) and<br />(d) Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br />(3) Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />&copy; Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />(e) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.<br />(4) An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.<br />(5) The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTES:<br />I) FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />ii) Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.<br />iii) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />iv) In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code "3" must be placed in block "B" of the "Agency Use Only" section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />v) For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>
<p>Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Information<br />a. Systems Security:<br />The work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of data that originated within the Department, data that the contractor manages or acquires for the Department, and/or data that is acquired in order to perform the contract and concerns Department programs or personnel.<br />For all systems handling such data, the contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to Department of Justice Systems, including by not limited to all Executive Branch system security requirements (e.g., requirements imposed by OMB and NIST), DOJ IT Security Standards and DOJ Order 2640.2E.

All DOJ information is sensitive information unless designated as non-sensitive by the Department;<br />5. Contractor-owned removable media, such as removable hard drives, flash drives, CDs, and floppy disks, containing DJB data, shall not be removed from DOJ facilities unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product;<br />6. When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with security requirements applicable to DOJ;<br />7. Contracting firms shall keep an accurate inventory of devices used on DOJ contracts;<br />8. Rules of behavior must be signed by users. These rules shall address at a minimum: authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of sensitive data and personally identifiable information.<br />9. All DOJ data will be removed from contractor-owned laptops upon termination of contractor work. This removal must be accomplished in accordance with DOJ IT Security Standard requirements. Certification of data removal will be performed by the Contractor's project manager and a letter confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of termination of contractor work.<br />b. Data Security:<br />By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that with respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or suspected breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the contracting officer's technical representative (COTR). If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO or the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT<br />(1-866-874-2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach. The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.<br />c. Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement:<br />The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval, of the Department. The contractor assumes full responsibility for taking<br />corrective action consistent with the Department's Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include offering credit monitoring when appropriate. <br />d. Pass-through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors (MAR 2008)<br />The requirements set forth in Paragraphs a through c above, apply to all subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract. For each subcontractor, the contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor to adhere to all such requirements. Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.</p>
<p>Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act<br />The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and its amendments have resulted in an increasing number of requests to Federal Agencies for copies of Technical/Management and Business Proposals from other than Government sources.<br />The offeror should identify information in its Technical/Management and Business Proposals the offeror believes should be withheld from these sources, on the basis the proposals consist of "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential" (exemption (b) (4) of the FOIA). This identification will assist in the decision by a responsible federal official to disclose or withhold the requested information.<br />If an offeror considers elements of its proposal to be exempt under FOIA, ensure the following notice is annotated on the title page of the proposal:<br />Elements of this document, as identified on individual pages, are considered by the submitter to be privileged or confidential trade secrets or commercial or financial information not subject to mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Material considered privileged or confidential on this basis is contained on pages ____. The offeror must annotate each individual item it considers privileged or confidential under the FOIA exemption with the following notice: The data or information is considered confidential or privileged, and not subject to mandatory disclosure under the FOIA. All information in an offeror's proposal not designated may be subject to automatic public disclosure if it is requested under the FOIA. It must be emphasized that under the FOIA no information is automatically exempt from public disclosure. However, no disclosures will be made without careful evaluation, giving due regard to the need for<br />safeguarding material considered privileged or confidential by the offeror. It is Department of Justice policy to withhold whenever possible material that is genuinely privileged or confidential.<br />COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE PROVISION (OCT 2003)<br />This service has been determined to be that of a common law employee if awarded to an individual. Therefore, the following applies:<br />- Individuals, other than corporations, shall submit a fully completed W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, along with their quotation or offer.<br />- When award is made to an individual, the provision of these services has been determined to meet certain criteria for creating a common law employment relationship.

<DESC>The work requested for this project is as follows:1. Connect the sprinkler system in the new freezer to the riser in the institution side of the Warehouse. The freezer was installed with internal piping and sprinkler heads already installed. 
2. Install piping and sprinkler heads in the Loading dock building (approximately 30' by 40') and connect this to the existing system as well. 
3. Both installations will be dry systems meaning they will be filled with air so cost for a compressor or two will have to be included. 
4. No trenching or digging will be required. All above ground work. 
5. Install an adequate number of sprinkler heads in the Institution side of the Warehouse rest room. 
6. Install an adequate number of heads in the outside existing freezer (approximately 15' by 25').

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. 

Factor I - Technical Capability 

a. Internet Capability - The offer shall provide internet capability in all sleeping rooms and office space.

b. Parking - The offer shall have the ability to provide parking accommodation for fifteen vehicles at the facility. 

Factor II - Past Performance 

The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The quoter will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness. The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type

Contract number

Contract/Task value

Agency/Company Name

Agency/Company point of contact telephone number

Duration of task/contract

Type of services provided (brief description)

Factor III  Price

The price quotation will be assessed to determine if proposed prices are fair and reasonable.  Price will be the determining factor for award if two or more offers are determined to be technically equal.  


Notice: The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussion with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint. In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

Legal effect of quotations: As prescribed in FAR 13.004(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore issuance by the Government of an order in response to a suppliers quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.  Facsimile quotes are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-384-7230, and email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil.

FAR 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQs technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>2. Install piping and sprinkler heads in the Loading dock building (approximately 60' by 60') and connect this to the existing system as well.&nbsp; This system will be a dry sprinkler system.</p>

Approval as used in this paragraph means the contracting officers written notification to the contractor accepting the test results of the first article.  The initial delivery order expected to be awarded at the time of award or shortly thereafter, will execute the first article testing requirement.

Note 2:  Initial delivery of no less than a quantity of 6,100 physical training uniforms each (shirt and trunk) within 90 days after approval of first article test and delivery thereafter of no less than a quantity of 10,000 physical training uniforms every 60 days after issuance of subsequent delivery orders until delivery is complete.

Note 7:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  (End of addendum)


BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the purchase descriptions for Table I - Physical Requirements for Basic Material and Material Requirements, Table II - Finished Measurements and visual examination.

2)  PRODUCTION/MANAGEMENT PLAN  will be evaluated for the following.  All subfactors are equal in importance:

Sub-factor 2.1 Proposed Management Approach:  
The offerors personnel/labor pool to determine if they possess the requisite human resources to perform the requirements of the solicitation;

The offerors infrastructure to determine if they possess the production facilities and resources (suppliers) necessary to meet solicitation requirements in compliance with the Buy American Act, the H.R.1/Berry Amendment and Small Business Set-Aside Restrictions;

The offerors program/production schedule to assess their ability to produce the required unit quantities on time (estimated @ 20,000 annually with surge capability of 50,000 annually) and to keep the program on schedule (capable of producing/delivering 10,000 within 60 days);  

Sub-factor 2.2  Proposed Quality Plan:
The offerors plan to monitor, measure, and ensure product quality in all phases of contract performance and in accordance with Purchase Description T-Shirt, Physical Fitness Uniform, US Coast Guard, Revised 24 November 2008; Purchase Description Trunks, Physical Fitness Uniform, US Coast Guard, dtd October 20, 2008;

3) EXPERIENCE  will be evaluated for the following:

The offerors proposal demonstrates the vendors ability to manufacture the items under this solicitation or items similar in nature in accordance with Government specifications and delivery requirements.

4) PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

(4) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 50,000 (for each trunk and shirt) for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  All (4) factors mentioned above are of equal importance and all (4) factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>Q84: Regarding the page count.  Offerors are to include in their proposals Manufacturers data sheets for all proposed equipment.  In our experience, data sheets only average 8-10 sheets per item of which we have no control over.  Once we have met the criteria for providing data sheets (approximately 50 pages), a Statement of Work (approximately 25 pages), a Quality Assurance Plan (approximately 5 pages), a Performance Metrics and Measurement Plan (approximately 2 pages), a company would not be able to address all elements of the Statement of Objectives in approximately 15-20 pages.  Would the Government reconsider eliminating at least the data sheets and SOW from the 100-page limitation requirement?  If not, would it be acceptable to include a website link for the offerors proposed equipment?

A84: Based on the above, data sheets will not be counted in the 100-page requirement, but do need to be provided.

Q85: There appears to be some inconsistency between the Instructions to Offerors, Questions and Answers, and the combined synopsis/solicitation regarding the cost proposal: a) The combined synopsis/solicitation states the ATF3 Jet Engine Test Cell as one item, the T-700-GE-401 Engine Turboshaft Test as an option, Sustainment of equipment, hardware, software, and spare parts for a base year and potential four one-year option periods. b) Factor VI--Price or Cost states the total evaluated price for a basic system that encompasses any or all of the OTC will be the total price for the basic system offered, including the one-year base period, the three options periods, and the three award term periods.  The total evaluated price for proposals offering a basic system with separately priced OTC will be the total of the basic system, the total of the separately priced OTC, for the one-year base period and the two (2) options periods.  c) Questions and Answers 31 states both the ATF3 and the T700/CT7 upgrades are now included in the base requirement. The upgrades will be done consecutively; the ATF3 will be dropped and upgraded first. When those upgrades are completed the T700 Cell will be dropped and upgraded. The 90 days is for each cell independently. Can the Government provide a Section B--Supplies or Services and Prices with the appropriate CLIN structure?

A85: The second test cell is no longer an option; both are to be upgraded.  Factor VI is corrected as follows: there will be a base year for the upgrades and sustainment and four one-year option periods for sustainment.  There are no award term periods.  A sample Schedule B will be posted; however, the intent is to allow vendors flexibility in providing innovative solutions.

Q86: In my recent conversation with the Honeywell contact you provided (email string listed below) Mr. Jeffrey Tormanen, he stated that Honeywell cannot and will not release any of the below mentioned documentation.  He informed me that a Honeywell/Coastguard representative had been assigned to this case to pursue licensing of the publications.  This process, Mr. Tormanen stated, could take an excess of 30 days. Having said this, my question is: Does the Coast Guard plan on delaying the solicitation until the tech. documents are made readily available to all interested parties?

A86:  The CG has been working with Honeywell to resolve this issue.  POC is David Shilliday (Honeywell Aero Licensing CoE), Licensing Manager, 1300 W. Warner Road, Tempe, AZ 85284, 480-592-2422, david.shilliday@honeywell.com.  The solicitation will be extended once the amount of time needed for this process is confirmed by the POC.

Q87: My new question relates to the T700 cell only:  Does the USCG already have a way to move the engines from the USCG-provided engine cart onto the fixed test stand or is one required to be included in an offer?

A87: The CG currently uses a hand pump hoist that is mounted unto the test stand.  The offeror is encouraged to provide his/her best solution.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support Air Force communications as it applies to Modeling and Simulation, Enterprise Management, and Networking and Communication Links for the future Airborne Network (AN). Even though the primary technology area is modeling and simulation for AN, this BAA is open to solicitations in the areas of enabling technologies for AN.</p>
<p>The AN is the airborne extension of the Air Force's ConstellationNet portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG).</p>
<p>The AN is defined to be an infrastructure that provides communication transport services through at least one node that is on a platform capable of flight. This can best be visualized in the context of the operating domains served by the GIG. The Transformational Communications Satellite System (TSAT) network will provide space connectivity and the GIG-Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) network together with networks such as those provided under the Combat Information Transport System and Theater Deployable Communications will provide surface connectivity. Airborne connectivity within the GIG will be provided by the AN. The AN will connect to both the space and surface networks, making it an integral part of the communications fabric of the GIG.</p>
<p>The AN will differ from the existing terrestrial and space-based networks due to the unique environment. The AN will be composed of subnetworks of heterogeneous networks and links. Airborne platforms will enter and leave different subnetworks and the AN as they transit through the area at speeds of up to Mach 2. Links making up the subnetworks and the AN will consist of a collection of differing types to include point-to-point, broadcast, ad hoc, simplex plus many other kinds.</p>
<p>To realize the AF vision for the AN, this extension of the GIG in the airborne domain must be easy to use, configure, and maintain and must provide:</p>
<p>Ubiquitous and assured network access to all Air Force platforms;</p>
<p>GIG core services whose integrity is assured;</p>
<p>Quality appropriate to the commander's intent and rules of engagement (ROE);</p>
<p>Rapid response to mission growth, emerging events and changing mission priorities;</p>
<p>End-to-end interoperation with joint services, coalition, and non-DoD partners and legacy systems in all physical network domains (sub-surface, surface, airborne and space);</p>
<p>The eventual AN will exist on a variety of airborne platforms. Each air asset/platform may have a different network role within the AN:</p>
<p>Legacy - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems capable of supporting voice, tactical data link (TDL), and possibly some point-to-point Internet Protocol (IP) network connections for very limited services (e.g., email only). The term "legacy" also includes any non-IP enabled hardware/software on any platform.</p>
<p>Relay/Gateway - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems as described for a legacy node, but also include equipment that enable them to access multiple TDLs and to relay data Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), or transfer data formats from one link to another.</p>
<p>Network Access - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which provides an IP network connection to an AN or GIG network node. Although these nodes are tethered to the network, they do not provide any AN service to other nodes on the network.</p>
<p>Network Capable - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can join an IP data network (Tactical Subnet) and provide limited AN service (e.g., transit routing) to other nodes on that local network.</p>
<p>Internetwork - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can access and interconnect multiple IP data networks. These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes when interconnected to the GIG through a Network Service Provider node.</p>
<p>Network Service Provider - Airborne platforms, fixed or deployed ground facilities, or space-based packages equipped with IP network capable communications systems, which can access multiple IP data networks. These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to interconnect with a GIG network (e.g., Defense Information Support Network (DISN), Joint Task Force (JTF) Service Component Network, etc.) service delivery node (SDN) and to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes.</p>
<p>Candidate areas of research to solve AN-unique problems or show feasibility (or non-feasibility) of solutions that will enable the eventual fielding of this capability as applied/integrated to the airborne networking environment, include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1) Airborne Networking Modeling and Simulation: Some of the areas are: Network Centric Warfare (NCW) based AN to the current set of Air Force missions and flexible enough to adapt to emerging mission sets; AN components modeling (e.g. Link 16 and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)); measures of effectiveness and performance assessment; Man-in-the-loop and Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and experiments, analyses of mobile communication network node's [platforms] flight-plan-adjustments [metrics, mechanisms, algorithms, and equipment] to enable the optimization of communications performance and network connectivity; dynamic ad hoc networks management; mobile IP information routing; multi-mission network centric warfare environments; analysis of alternatives; support for real-time decision-making, dynamic situation assessment, dynamic prediction, predictive assessments, operationally focused/embedded simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, course of action analyses; AN training; develop experimental hardware and software in the laboratory and conduct experiments and demonstrations; and perform integration and validation and verification of models, simulations, enterprise management performance, airborne link and routing performance, and other solutions as required. It is expected that components will integrate into a complete M&amp;S environment.</p>
<p>2) Airborne Network Enterprise Management (EM): This area can be broken down into six sub-areas, each with unique airborne asset considerations: event assessment, policy networking, course of action generation, mission-based understanding, cross-domain capability, and cross-cutting concerns (with includes security).</p>
<p>- Event assessment may include the ability to "see" the status of nearby coalition, joint service or other component networks in order to obtain a larger perspective of network status. The clustered nature of the AN, with nodes moving in and out of range of each other, will require consideration.</p>
<p>- Policy Networking (i.e. policy-based networking) may be used to facilitate the need for manageable end-to-end, mission-based quality-of-service.</p>
<p>- Courses of action could be generated by, but limited to, faster-than-real-time simulation, predictive network planning, established doctrine/policy, and documented response. Course of action methods to reconfigure network nodes to compensate for an anomalous event could be based on prediction of topology and connectivity changes.</p>
<p>- Mission understanding includes a "relative," individualized mission criticality as well as potential mapping to a larger globally accepted criticality.</p>
<p>- Cross-Domain capability: Multi-layer security and monitoring/controlling multiple domains from a single domain based on mutual agreements.</p>
<p>- Cross-cutting Concerns include (1) standardized methods (e.g. intelligent agents) for monitoring/managing (or tying to resident monitoring/managing capability) legacy systems; (2) Information Assurance (IA), as well as platform-based network defense, must be integrated into EM solutions; (3) Network Services should consider Domain Name Service (DNS), network time, network addressing, and service location services/protocol; (4) considerations for on-platform EM Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for inexperienced airborne operators; (5) DoD and AF projected architecture models and standards, e.g., service oriented architecture, IPv6 integration, etc. This also includes Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES): Application/Platform Services, Collaboration Services, Discovery Services, Enterprise Management Services, Messaging Services, Security Services, Storage Services, and User Assistance Services.</p>
<p>3) Airborne Networking and Communications Links: We are looking for innovative ideas involving networking and communications links that will help enable this future capability. Such techniques and ideas may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: methods by which nodes will address and route traffic between heterogeneous subnetworks in conditions that are dynamic, with rapidly changing network topologies; methods to alleviate the impacts upon the network of changing connectivity with links/nodes entering/leaving networks; techniques to enable traffic priority and Quality of Service (QoS) to make optimal use of the limited resources possibly including the concepts of content delivery networking (CDN) and/or content-based routing; mechanisms to enable existing and future wire-line based protocols to operate over wireless links and networks as well as the means to handle the security and information assurance problems associated with using these protocols; mechanisms to enable the use of IPv4/IPv6 (dual-stack) in coexistence; policy-based networking techniques; new high bandwidth, high quality, communications links; advanced error detection, error correction and compressions schemes; and antenna designs for improved performance on airborne platforms.</p>
<p>4) Information Assurance for Airborne Networking: Innovative ideas are being sought to counter cyber-threats against both network control and data cyber-security attributes suitable for low data rate, low bandwidth, limited connectivity AN Environment. These attributes include Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and non-repudiation, across the airborne network architectures. Routing across Heterogeneous RF Links and Nets, as well as connection to ground entry points in the GIG, needs to be factored in the design. Areas being sought include the understanding of the cyber threats in the AN environment, and responsive IA capability to counter such threats. This includes the testing and integration of mobile, manageable, low network overhead, IA sensors and network technology to enhance operational C2 system capabilities capable of differentiating between naturally occurring disturbances and human made, disruption, delay, destroy, deny and degradation (5Ds). Another key area is End-to-End Information Assurance performance metrics and integrated network visualization concepts.</p>

<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the particular effort, the offeror may be required to share information about the software and inputs and/or output files or data required for subsequent portions of the effort with other participants in this BAA. Winning contractors shall enter into Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) for any portion of the contract requiring joint participation in the accomplishment of the Government's requirement. The requirement for joint participation with other contractors under this BAA will be determined by the program manager. Offeror's method and intention to comply with this requirement should be clearly stated in the proposal.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<p>This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of increased situational awareness for ISR cross platform collaboration and cross platform cueing.</p>
<p>Today's intelligence operators and analysts continue to rely on solutions that are largely domain or sensor-type specific. Additionally, the closed architectures of the various systems make the combination of each system's capabilities into a single component costly and, in some cases, not possible. This BAA addresses the need for an open-architected and scalable solution to these issues. The requirement is for an integrated, operator-focused, multi-intelligence knowledge association system that can ingest data from multiple ISR sensors and intelligence sources and support cross platform cueing, cross platform collaboration, Time Critical/Sensitive Targeting, strike planning, and support to overall battlefield situation awareness monitoring, and reporting and provide Situation Assessment tools that can be adapted to a variety of missions including Area of Interest monitoring and alerting; High Interest Track monitoring and alerting; and enhancing operator understanding through cross referencing known information and databases.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies. This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units while developing new capabilities and technologies. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the five year program. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment.</p>
<p>The developed capabilities may be transitioned to the RC135 fleet to include Rivet Joint and Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and other ISR platforms.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.5M; FY 07 - $7.5M; FY 08 - $5.5M; FY09 - $5.9M; FY10 - $4.5M.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies. Key performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Carolyn Sheaff<br />Telephone: (315) 330-7147 <br />Email: Carolyn.Sheaff@rl.af.mil</p>

<DESC>Amendment A002 issued 4/6/09 to add CLINs for Overtime for Non-exempt Personnel.
Amendment A001 issued to correct the clause reference in the Travel and Subsistence CLINs to H.8, rather than H.12.
The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)
It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $200,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
This requirement is available for full-and-open competition.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
The A&E firm's submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 
1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence-Offeror shall submit examples (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities utilized in each of the following areas: (i) environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit, (ii) pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects), (iii) environmental management system implementation (can include ISO 14001 implementation), and (iv) environmental remedial investigation and design (CERCLA) performed within the last ten (10) years.  These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort, their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables.)  Projects completed for the Federal Government, in particular, should be included, if any.
2. Past Performance-For each of the examples presented in response to Factor 1 above, offerors shall provide information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders.
3. Professional Qualifications Necessary for Satisfactory Performance of Required Services-Offeror shall submit a complete rsum of the experience of each executive/supervisor and technical staff member presently employed by the company who will be devoting all, or a majority of, their time to this contract.  Rsums should include:  name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Rsums of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is required.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty (30) days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.  Offeror shall provide documentation as to laboratory capability for one or more primary laboratories and one or more quality assu7rance laboratories.  Documentation should be sufficient to indicate that laboratory capabilities in such areas as analytical methodology, quality assurance and reporting are equivalent to those required of laboratories participating in the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP.)  Evidence of current participation, as a CLP laboratory, will be sufficient to meet this requirement.
4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time-Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload; i.e. total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, examples of completed projects and time tables associated with their completion should be provided.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.
5. Geographic Location-The offeror's geographic location relative to the Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, will be evaluated in this element, with higher scores given to those firms closest to the Aeronautical Center.
6. Minority and Women Employment-The percentage of minority employees in all job classifications and pay scales, noting the percentage of minorities in the immediate locality and general surrounding area, and the number of women in all job classifications and pay scales, will be evaluated.
Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.  
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (April 23, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, April 23, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CHANGE THE QUESTION AND SUBMISSION DUE DATES (BY ONE WEEK) AND CHANGES THE NAICS CODE.  THE SUBMISSION DATE IS CHANGED TO MAY 1, 2009 AND QUESTION DUE DATE IS CHANGED TO APRIL 17, 2009.  THE NAICS CODE IS CHANGED TO 541512. 

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BIOMETRICS SYSTEMS INTEGRATION SERVICES - Within the next several months, the Department of State intends to release a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through the GSA Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Multiple Award Schedule. The Classification NAICS code is 541512 - Computer Systems Design and Related Services.  The purpose of the RFQ will be to acquire the services of a well-qualified organization to integrate automated face recognition (FR) systems, and possibly other biometric technologies (e.g., iris recognition), into the Departments visa and passport application processing operations.  For this effort, the Department intends to issue a five-year, performance-based, firm-fixed-price contract to a systems integrator, with award likely by October 2009.  This preliminary announcement is a Request for Information (RFI)  first, to alert those organizations that may be interested and need to establish prime-subcontractor relationships before the release of the RFQ and, second, to request white papers that will be used by the Department to identify organizations on Schedule 70 from which proposals would be solicited.

In addition to tailoring its biometric recognition systems to meet the Departments visa and passport processing needs, the organization selected for the proposed effort will be required to install, operate, and maintain their systems, as well as to update their systems periodically to the evolving state-of-the-art.  Biometric technology is required by the Department to comply with mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  For about five years, the Department has been using digitized face images and FR technology to confirm a visa or passport holders identity more reliably, facilitate the detection of fraudulent applications, increase the security of U.S. visas and passports, detect or deter known terrorists or criminals, and verify travelers identities at U.S. ports of entry.  The biometric capability to be provided by the selected integrator will support the processing of applications for U.S. nonimmigrant and immigrant visas (NIV/IV), passports, and E-Diversity Visas (E-DV).  

The requirements anticipated for the FR processing of NIV/IV and passport applications include open-set one-to-many matching (identification) of applicant-provided face-photo images with face images in legacy databases holding many tens of millions of images and in various watch-lists containing hundreds of thousands of images.  In some cases, binning (i.e., filtering based on criteria developed by the Department) will be used to increase accuracy and reduce the processing required to search very large databases.  Passport and NIV/IV matching will be performed on integrator-provided equipment.  It is anticipated that the FR systems selected will be dedicated to enrolling the legacy databases and watch-lists during the first 100 days of the contract.  It is also anticipated that during each of the five years of the contract, approximately 15 million new passport images and approximately 10 million new NIV/IV images will need to be enrolled and searched by the systems, corresponding to a total enrollment and matching rate of up to about 4,000 images per hour (allowing for additional capacity during peak travel periods and expedited responses).  The capability for the systems to perform one-to-one matching (verification) is also required.  The passport and NIV/IV FR systems will have the capability to read biometric transactions from an Oracle database, process the transactions, and write transaction outputs as records to the Oracle database.  The recognition score for each potentially matching image returned from each search will be one of the outputs, and the maximum rank (number of potential matches returned) for each search will be an adjustable parameter.  At least two identical FR systems are required in different Department-provided secure facilities to share the load and to serve as backups to one another in the event of a system failure.

The requirements anticipated for the E-DV FR system include open-set identification of hundreds of thousands of applicant-submitted face images with images in a database of approximately 15 million images.  Operating on Government-furnished equipment (GFE) within a Department-provided secure facility, the E-DV FR system will enroll all submitted E-DV images during a two-month period every year.  Once enrollment is completed, matching will be performed within a following two-month period, using the same GFE. 

In addition to the FR matching capabilities, the following services, products, or capabilities are likely to be needed by the Department:

	Maintenance of a system log file, which can be accessed by Department of State personnel at any time, including volumes enrolled and a list of all images that failed to enroll, along with the reasons for the failures-to-enroll, number of images matched, periods of system downtime, and gallery sizes  
	Operations manuals and system diagrams for all biometric systems installed under the contract
	Periodic performance (speed and accuracy) testing of all biometric systems installed under the contract
	Installation, following Department approval, of updated versions of the selected FR software within one month of their public release
	Face image quality assessment software to test the suitability of applicants images for FR and their conformance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) quality requirements for face images in passports.  This software will provide quality metric values that convey to an operator whether a submitted image is likely to be enrolled successfully and, if not, a probable reason why it would not be enrolled.  Related software that provides the capability to perform quality assessment of passport or visa application photo images submitted over the Internet will also be required.
	A software tool to facilitate visual comparisons of face images by trained face examiners
	A software utility for manual enrollment of face images (based on manually entered eye positions), when the automated system cannot find the eyes
	Acquisition, enrollment, and matching capabilities for other biometric technologies, such as iris recognition

To manage the number of organizations that prepare completed technical and cost proposals, the Department will use a three-phase, down-select acquisition process.  In the first phase, responses to this RFI will be evaluated to determine which organizations are solicited to respond to the RFQ.  If your organization would like to participate in the first phase, you must respond to this announcement by e-mailing to Ms. Jo-Ann Stewart (at StewartJ@state.gov) a white paper describing your organizations capabilities and experience in biometrics systems integration.  Your submission in response to this RFI must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT on Friday, 1 Mayl 2009.  Your white paper must be prepared in Microsoft Word 2003, be no greater than five pages in length, and include the following information:  1.) your organizations full name, headquarters location, and location of an office in the Washington, DC area, if any, 2.) the name of a point-of-contact and his/her e-mail and conventional mailing addresses, 3.) a description of the qualifications of the key staff who will be involved, 4.) a description of your organizations experience with FR and other biometric technologies, with particular emphasis on government applications and one-to-many matching, and 5.) a brief description of your planned approach to providing biometrics systems integration services to the Department.  Your response must also include the table shown below, with all applicable fields completed.  The table will not count as one of the allowed five pages for the white paper; however, the table should contain no more than five projects involving face recognition or other biometrics for which your organization has been a major technical contributor or prime contractor.  

All questions concerning this RFI may be submitted by sending an e-mail to Ms. Stewart no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT Friday, 17 April 2009.  Questions received after that date will not be answered, unless the Government determines the answer to the question imparts information material to Industrys ability to respond to this RFI.  Government responses to questions will be posted.  The required format for the submission of questions is provided at the end of this RFI.

Based upon the responses to this RFI, organizations deemed qualified by the Department will be selected to participate in the second phase of the acquisition.  Those organizations selected will receive a copy of the RFQ and be solicited to submit full technical and cost proposals.  After an evaluation of all submitted technical proposals, up to three organizations will be selected to participate in the third phase of the procurement, during which they will be asked to submit and run evaluation versions of their offered FR systems for recognition accuracy testing.  The accuracy testing will use face images representative of those now being processed in applications received for U.S. visas and/or passports.  The Department will consider the results from that testing, along with the content of the technical and cost proposals, in its award of a contract for the proposed biometrics systems integration effort.  

The issuance of this RFI and its solicitation of white papers do not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any information requested.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical, however, it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses.  Each page considered by a submitting organization to contain proprietary information must be so marked.

The purpose of the activity is to procure technical assistance, training, equipment and commodities to assist the development of agricultural sector in Tajikistan.  Activities will focus on increasing the productivity of traditional agricultural crops and expanding agricultural profitability.  This approach will address basic needs in food insecure areas and have enough flexibility to support post-harvest processing wherever needed and feasible.

This procurement shall be conducted through full and open competition, under which any type of organization is eligible to compete.  The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.

Information on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in this country can be found through various English and Russian-language websites and NGO organizations.  We also encourage organizations which are registered in Tajikistan to express their status as such on the Interested Vendor List at www.fbo.gov to assist in making this information known to others.

This Acquisition shall be competed as SMALL BUSINESS. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. A Small Business solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Small Business within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $20 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 Thousand. The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<br /><br />There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov. Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only. It is the contractors responsibility to check the below-listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.

This Acquisition shall be competed as HUBZONE. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. A HubZone solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $50 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as HubZone within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $10 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 Thousand. The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<br /><br />There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.
