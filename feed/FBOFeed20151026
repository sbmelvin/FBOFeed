<DESC>ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING (A/E) DESIGN SERVICES: The WBJ Dorn VA Medical Center, Columbia, SC is seeking qualified A/E Firms to furnish professional design services for project 544-1602 Construct Behavioral Health Center of Excellence Addition. Responses should be submitted on a Standard Form 330. The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP type in SF330 in the "Find a Form" block and click on search. 


 Construct Behavioral Health Center of Excellence Addition

The purpose of this minor construction project is to design and construct a new behavioral health center at the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center located in Columbia, SC. This project will address the needs of VA patients and employees with a building that is tailored to the functional and operational needs of mental health services and will improve and increase accessibility for patients and clinical staff. The design developed will provide adequate direction for the complete construction of the behavioral health center.

This project will construct a building to address the 15,000 sf gap identified in the projected gap data to include 1,000 sf of administrative space, 1,000 sf of support space and 1,000 sf of common/swing/construction space. Services provided range from General Outpatient Mental Health (GMH) services to include service to Veterans for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center (PRRC), Substance Use Treatment Program (SATP), Compensated Work Therapy (CWT), and Suicide Risk Reduction (SRR). There is a growing need to develop more reliable methodologies for monitoring patient wait times for mental health care. In light the increased number of mental health referrals that cross programs of care (e.g. from Endocrinology to General Mental Health Outpatient) as well as referrals from one facility to another (e.g. referral from a PTSD team at one facility to a PTSD residential program at another facility) it has become necessary to expand our services. The addition would be connected to the current Mental Health building and provide a seamless transition into much needed additional mental health therapies. The addition would range from a one to a two story building maximum. It would consist of 12,000 sq feet for the establishment of the MH-PACT model with additional square footage to support the operational functionality of the building. VACO facility reviews encourage the expansion of Tele-mental health to provide education to staff on state-of-the-art tele-mental health research and practice to practitioners in order to facilitate tele-mental health referral and acceptance by providers and Veterans. Tele-mental health is currently limited due to space constraints. Increase tele modalities also require increased IT capacity which would be built into the new project.

A/E shall provide full and complete new construction design and specifications as stated within the Supplement B document. Location of the structure shall be recommended by the A/E service with final approval by the VA. The behavioral health center is proposed to be located in the parking lot north of building 2. In the event that the SHPO denies the proposed location, the A/E scope will include the selection of another site on the campus or offsite recommendations. The A/E fee is to include any and all costs associated with the final selection and design for the final site selection. The A/E service will be responsible for determining a layout and arrangement. It is anticipated that the new construction will result in the addition of 15,000 GSF to the Columbia, SC VAMC Campus. 

Value engineering is encouraged and shall be noted at each design review. The project is limited to new construction of a 15,000 GSF behavioral and mental health facility, HVAC and other utility work, interior finishes, utility coordination and site work. Design and construction shall adhere to all applicable VA standards and specifications. Construction may be phased to minimize disruptions to the operations of the Medical Center.

The C&A requirements do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

The estimated construction cost range for this project is approximately $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.

All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed six (6) percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC), 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room B1N238, Bethesda, Maryland 20892 intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis to Infor Inc. for Software Maintenance and service Support for the Lawson System Foundation 9 and to upgrade the system from Foundation 9 to Foundation 10 without providing for full and open competition.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE for the intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541519 with a Size Standard of $25.5 Million.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price purchase order with 1 year base and 4 one year options period from date of this award.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to get software maintenance and service support for the Lawson System Foundation 9 and upgrade the system from Foundation 9 to Foundation 10.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>Software Maintenance and Service:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide comprehensive maintenance and service support for the Lawson Foundation 9 system.<br />1. Provide product patches/repair fixes when software defects are encountered.<br />2. Provide access to Lawson application and technical support Engineers<br />3. Provide access to upgrades and conversion software<br />4. Provide support service tools access for Lawson Interactive Support (LIS) web notifications, web training/documentation and the Lawson knowledge Base<br />5. Provide 24*7 emergency support in the event of application failure<br />6. Provide access to approved incremental product enhancements. <br />Infor is the copyright owner for this Lawson System and is the only vendor that has the unrestricted ability to access and modify the Infor owned software products in order to provide bugs, fixes, updates and upgrades as part of the support and maintenance.<br />System Upgrade.</p>
<p>The Lawson system currently uses version 9. The system needs to be upgraded to version 10 in order to meet the expanding needs of the department. Version 10 provides the gateway to add Smart Office and the three other modules.</p>
<p>Upgrade software packages include:</p>
<p>1. Smart Office: software that provides a very user friendly interface with the inventory software and provides the capability to combine item lists, purchase requests/lists, and images and export lists and other information to Excel and/or email. Smart Office adds an especially important capability of providing master updates; a change on one screen updates all the other effected screens.<br />2. Mobile Supply Chain Management: software that provides ability to use barcoding in the Storage and Distribution (S &amp; D) warehouse and in Central Hospital Supply (CHS). Barcoding would improve the accuracy and reliability of par and cycle counting. Pick lists generated by the system software in S &amp;D would be on a barcode device; likewise for pick lists in CHS, picking the items would automatically decrease the inventory and send updates to the inventory software. The barcoding software and device can also be used to return items to locations and automatically increase the inventory. <br />3. Distribution: provides the ability to track the components and usage of the individual components in kits that are assembled in house by CHS staff. This software provides the ability to track the individual components in each kit, the item location, replenishment information and generate pick lists when more kits need to be assembled.&emsp;<br />4. Learning Accelerator: provides the ability to develop and incorporate online training that is specific to how MMESD uses the system so the training is tailored to the MMESD's policies and procedures on how the software is used; this would be helpful to all users and will help ensure that the software use is standardized which should greatly reduce errors.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Leica Microsystems Inc., 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL, 60089-6622, to upgrade the Leica TCS SP5II confocal microscope with the HyD detector package for the Genetics and Developmental Biology Center (GDBC) in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.<br /><br />The purview of DIR's research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.<br /><br />DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders.<br /><br />The Genetics and Developmental Biology Center (GDBC) is dedicated to investigating the roles of genes and gene networks in a variety of biological processes related to organismal development and the maintenance of homeostasis. In addition, there is a significant emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these cellular regulatory components are disrupted to cause disease, and how they can be manipulated to develop new gene-based and other therapies. GDBC investigators make use of a variety of approaches to answer these questions, including model genetic systems like Drosophila, fluorescent imaging, and genomic technologies.</p>

<p>The anticipated work includes repair of the first and second units using Government-furnished internal hub components. Some of these components will have a machining allowance and will require final machining after field measurements have been taken. The third and fourth units will be repaired using Contractor-furnished internal hub components. These components shall be procured by the Contractor and be delivered in such a way as to not delay the repair work. These components include, but are not limited to, blade bushings, operating rod bushings, eye ends, pins, pin bushings, link plates, and other linkage components.</p>
<p>Additionally, a full set of internal hub components shall be procured by the Contractor. This set will become a spare set of components for the Government and shall be delivered prior to completing the repair of the fourth unit.</p>

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This RFI is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The resultant contract will require access to export controlled data and software in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administrative Act of 1979, as amendment, (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.). The data and software will be provided in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5230.25 enclosure 5. For prime and/or subcontractors under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) award will be dependent on the agency's determination that the contractor has adequate controls in place to ensure the proper protection of the export controlled data and software. This determination will not be made prospectively as this would require advance knowledge of proposal content not yet received. In accordance with sections 2-307 and 10-509 of the DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), FOCI companies must include with their proposal either a copy of their Cognizant Security Agency (CSA) approved Technology Control Plan (TCP) or documentation showing the CSA has determined procedures already in place at the contractor's facility are adequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is conducting market research to identify companies that may possess the capabilities to produce the kits described below and potentially deliver these kits on a compressed schedule. Companies with experience producing kits should assess their ability to produce the CMC/Wx Radar kits without a complete technical data package (TDP) and should identify what additional work would be required to acquire, assemble, and ship the kits to the designated delivery destination. Companies should address the reasonableness to meet the kit assembly and delivery schedule for each year, taking into account that a final, formal technical data package will not be available to the USG until March 2017. Identify which Lot years your company can reasonably meet with regard to quantity deliveries and timeliness based on the information provided in this RFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI/sources sought or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-18 -- Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs. Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in the RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p><strong>2. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Program Description</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The C-5 aircraft's primary mission is to provide strategic airlift in support of Mobility Air Force's peace and war time missions. The C-5 users are represented by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard. At this time there are no current or planned international operators of this weapons system.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Capability Required</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contractor will be responsible for procuring, building, and delivering CMC/WxR modification kits for up to 50 C-5M aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Schedule.</strong> Contract award is scheduled to occur by 31 January 2017. The Government requires modification kits to support the installation schedule. Deliveries should begin as kits are completed and each lot must complete delivery within 12 months of the lot's start date:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 1, 7 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2017 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 2, 9 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 3, 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 4, 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2020<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 5, 4 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2021</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Procurement.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to set contracts or Technical Assistance Agreements with both the aircraft and component level Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The current OEMs are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lockheed Martin Aero - Marietta, GA (Prime Original Equipment Manufacturer for Airframe)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Honeywell - Albuquerque, NM (Core Mission Computer)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Rockwell-Collins - Cedar Rapids, IA (Weather Radar)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Ballard Technology - Everett, WA (Video Display Unit)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Mega Industries - Gorham, ME (Waveguide)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the organic technical repair center for depot-level maintenance is Warner-Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kit Builds.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to build kits in accordance with Government-approved drawings. Formal technical data packages are not set for release until March 2017. The offeror should assume no parts (i.e. bench stock, work order residue, etc.) called out in the provisioning parts list are available at the installation site -- all items shall be provided as part of each individual kit. There are an estimated 375 pieces in the total provisioning parts list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kit Deliveries.</strong> The final installation site for this effort has not been determined at this time. It is the offeror's responsibility to ship completed kits from the offeror's facilities to the installation location. For planning purposes, the Government will accept delivery at WR-ALC, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Security Requirements.</strong> Contractors will be required to have a SECRET clearance to gain access to Government and contractor facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Contract Specifications.</strong> The Government plans to use priced contract "options" by Lot year that best meet the needs of the Program measured in cost, schedule, and technical performance. Lot 1 kits are scheduled to be on contract as soon as January 2017. Expressed or implied warranties provided through the vendor should begin once components are installed on the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Modification Description</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CMC/WxR modification includes replacing and/or installing system line replaceable units, incorporating a software load port at an existing load panel, and adding radio frequency (RF) cabling between the load port and the replacement&nbsp;WxR receiver/transmitter. In addition, the modification includes a set of replacement waveguides, structural components and hardware, and wiring and attaching hardware. The list of associated Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and brief explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Versatile Integrated Avionics (VIA) unit - Honeywell: form-fit-function replacement with improved internal processing modules and integrated Ethernet ports for software loading. Part Number: CP8527501-905.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Avionics Integrated Unit (AIU) - Honeywell: form-fit-function replacement with improved internal processing modules and integrated Ethernet ports for software loading. Part Number: CP8527470-905.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Radar Pedestal - Rockwell-Collins: attaches to the base plate and supports the antenna flat panel. The pedestal is the "moving" part of the radar system. Part Number: WMA-701X<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Antenna Flat Panel - Rockwell-Collins: attaches to the pedestal. Part Number: WFA-701X<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR Receiver/Transmitter (RT) - Rockwell-Collins: the RT receives signals from the radar thru waveguides. Five (5) waveguide pieces will be assembled to make a single assembly during the modification. The waveguide will pass through existing holes in the aircraft structure. The RT mounts to the RT Tray. Part Number: WRT-2100.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR RT Tray - Rockwell-Collins: the tray will be mounted approximated 12 inches to the left of the existing RT. Includes a fan and fan test button. Part Number: WMT-701X.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Video Display Unit (VDU) - Ballard Technology: two (2) VDUs will pass through video signals to up to eight (8) cockpit displays. Signals will be transmitted from the RT thru RF cabling. The VDUs are new components to the C-5. Part Number: 11-11020-04.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR Control Panel - Rockwell-Collins: control panel is a swap out from the existing/legacy control panel. Part Number: WCP-701.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; UHF/Antenna Select Bunk PA Panel: manufactured by FTG Aerospace, Chatsworth, CA.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the VIA/AIU are separate LRUs but are interdependent and act as a single unit when installed. There are two each of these components installed on the aircraft.<br /><br /><strong>3. Company Response</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Sources Sought/RFI.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />Egg Baseline Study: A Survey on the Incidence of Salmonellae in Eggs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NOTE:<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition , which is 541380, Testing Laboratories, which has an associated Small Business size standard of $15 Million. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information it submits. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The primary microbiological concern in shell-eggs is contamination with Salmonella Entertidis (SE) and the potential human illness that results from consumption of contaminated eggs. Despite SE being the primary concern, other serovars have become an increasing concern. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates shell-eggs under the Egg Safety Rule (21 CFR 118). This regulation requires various SE prevention measures and testing requirements aimed at eliminating SE in the egg production environment and keeping contaminated eggs from human consumption channels. One component required to measure performance of the egg safety rule is an accurate, up to date, measure of the incidence of SE in eggs. Given the increasing concern with other serovars, an accurate incidence rate for all salmonellae would also be extremely beneficial. The currently accepted rate for SE positive eggs is 1 in 20,000. This rate is far outdated and numerous parties question the validity of this rate, particularly as it relates to the current production environments. Much change has occurred in the management practices, strain of birds, and layer house types used for production since the currently accepted rate was established. There is a clear need to determine what the true incidence rate is. In addition to SE, there are over 2,500 serovars of salmonella, all of which are human pathogens. The presence of any salmonella in an egg would be considered an adulterant under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. There is a pronounced lack of data on the incidence rate of all salmonellae in eggs, most data, although outdated, has been concentrated on SE. This type of data is necessary for inclusion in future risk assessments, for consideration of any potential future expansion of the egg safety rule, for other agencies (such as CDC) to update their attrition models and to the industry itself to help identify serovars of future concern before they become major public health issues. Data on the incidence rate of all salmonellae, along with data on SE specifically would also serve the Health and Human Services (HHS) to achieve the HHS Priority Goal of reducing foodborne pathogens in the population. HHS has set a goal of reducing SE associated illness from the 2007-09 baseline levels of 2.6 cases/100,000 population to 1.9 cases/100,000 population by December 31, 2015. Completion of this egg baseline study will represent a major benefit to multiple entities.<br /><br /><strong>Objectives<br /></strong>To determine the true incident rate of SE and other serovars in eggs by:<br />&bull; Collecting egg samples at egg production farms;<br />&bull; Analyzing egg samples collected to determine the presence of Salmonella and other SE's in accordance with the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM).<br /><strong><br />Scope <br /></strong>The egg baseline study will involve collection of egg samples across the country from multiple egg producers registered in the Shell Egg Producer Registration Module (SEPRM). Registration in SEPRM is required for any producer selling eggs to the table egg market with 3,000 or greater laying hens at a specific farm. Egg samples will be collected at egg production farms of all sizes, small and large. All productions systems will be included in the study, including but not limited to traditional caged production, cage-free production, organic and non-organic production. Subsequent to collection, egg samples will be analyzed for the presence of all salmonella, in accordance with methodology outlined in FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM, Chapter 5: Salmonella). The resulting data will be analyzed with the end goal of determining the incidence rate of all salmonella in eggs, in addition to the incidence of SE in eggs..</p>
<p><strong>Task Areas:<br /></strong>1. The Contractor shall develop, in conjunction with the COR, a detailed sampling scheme/schedule and conduct the physical collection of 3,000 composite samples of 20 eggs each from layer houses (pre-processing) of 200 farms. The Contractor shall strictly adhere to FDA biosecurity policies during sample collections, including a complete change of personal protective equipment between layer houses.<br /><br />2. The Contractor shall coordinate shipment of samples to the analyzing laboratory and conduct a microbiological assessment for the presence of all salmonella serovars in accordance with methodology cited in FDA egg safety rule (21 CFR 118.8(b)) .<br /><br />3. The Contractor shall analyze the data to report the incidence rate of all salmonella in eggs, in addition to reporting the specific incidence rate of SE in eggs.<br /><br />4. The Contractor shall assemble a detailed report on relevant findings, including a breakdown of the overall incidence of salmonella in eggs in addition to the incidence rate of SE, a breakdown of the incidence rate by geographic region, by season of the year, by size of producer, and by type of production system.<br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /></strong>One (1) year from the effective date of contract.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lead Researcher Qualifications:<br /></strong>The candidate must have a PhD and a minimum of five (5) years working experience in the areas of experimental design/development, sample collection, and microbiological analysis of samples. They must have extensive knowledge of egg industry and have specific knowledge of the production practices of various types of egg production facilities. They must have experience in the biosecurity practices common to the egg production industry, experience in coordination, execution, and management of large scale scientific studies. They must have extensive knowledge on the specific microbiological protocols used for isolation, identification, and serotyping of salmonellae in various food samples.</p>
<p><strong>Place of Performance:<br /></strong>Egg sample collection will take place at multiple farm locations across the United States. <strong>Analysis of the samples will occur at the Contractor's designated laboratory</strong>. The contractor shall be responsible for providing its own functioning laboratory facility.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing and Payment: <br /></strong>This requirement is anticipated to be a firm-fixed-price order, inclusive of all costs, such as labor, materials, shipping, and travel costs, with firm-fixed-price payment upon completion of specified deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>The FDA is requesting interested qualified small businesses to provide a capability statement showing their ability and willingness to complete this requirement electronically to Lisa Yaw at Lisa.Yaw@fda.hhs.gov in a commonly used format, such as Microsoft Word or pdf. This capability statement shall be no more than five pages, excluding a cover page and table of contents, and shall include examples of successfully completing relevant similar work, including a description of the similar work and client contact information. The FDA will be determining capability based on the ability to perform the tasks delineated above. Interested eligible small businesses shall also include company information to determine eligibility, including their contact information, Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and size and business type (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) based on the applicable NAICS code for the proposed acquisition 541380, Testing Laboratories which has an associated Small Business size standard of $15 Million. Entities have until 2 pm ET, Wednesday, November 17, 2015 to respond to the FDA.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br />SSA-RFI-14-0054
<p>Offsite Data/Media Storage and Disaster Recovery<br />Social Security Administration (SSA)</p>
<p><br />This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research and planning purposes. Please reference SSA-RFI-14-0054 when responding to this announcement.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The Social Security Administration has a need for vaulting and storage services of magnetic media as well as transportation services and emergency recall of media.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to 1) identify potential sources that can perform the work required and 2) identify industry best practices.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>The main purpose of this contract is to ensure that our data is secure and can be recalled in the event of a disaster or emergency. We anticipate needing daily transportation/pick-up/drop-off services for magnetic media for each of the locations identified below. In addition, we will require storage of the media in secure vaults (primary and secondary vaults) that we will need the contractor to provide. In the past, there has been a distance requirement for the different sites. Location, distance, schedule, and tape volume estimates are provided below:</p>
<p>9999 Bennett Creek Boulevard, Urbana, MD- Contractor's vault will need to be not less than 20 miles from SSA location, but not greater than 300 miles point-to-point (or as the crow flys).<br />Pick up: M-Saturday<br />Average Volume Est: 1400 tapes daily</p>
<p>3604 Hopson Road, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina - Contractor's vault will need to be not less than 5 miles from the SSA location, but not greater than 300 miles (point-to-point)<br />Pick up: M-F<br />Average Volume Est: 688 tapes daily</p>
<p>6201 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD: Distance will likely not be a requirement in the future. Tapes would go to the primary vault supporting Urbana.<br />Pick up: M-F<br />Average Volume Est: 30 daily</p>
<p>It is anticipated that we will need a secondary contractor provided vault as well as transportation of tapes from the primary vault to the secondary vault on a less frequent basis. The distance requirements from the primary vault for all locations in the past has been between 20-300 miles.</p>
<p>Responses:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, SSA is seeking to identify potential sources for this anticipated requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development's Mission to Southern Africa (USAID/SA)&nbsp;is conducting market research to identify potential sources capable of providing acquisition and assistance (A&amp;A) support services.
<p><strong>This request for information is issued solely for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10.</strong></p>
<p>This notice is not a solicitation or call for proposals.  Any proposals submitted in response to this request will not be considered. &nbsp; USAID will not pay for information submitted nor will it reimburse costs incurred by individuals or entities that elect to respond to this request for information (RFI).  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent's expense.  USAID is in no way obligated to utilize submitted information or issue a solicitation as a result of this request.  USAID is not obligated to procure any of the services described herein, nor should the release of this RFI be construed as such a commitment on the part of USAID. <br /> <br />This notice seeks information regarding potential sources, both individuals and entities, available to provide acquisition and assistance support services to the USAID/SA Regional Office of Acquisition and Assistance (ROAA) located in Pretoria, South Africa.  The ROAA is responsible for providing acquisition and assistance support for USAID's programs in the Southern African region, and is currently staffed with 22 local and international personnel, including 8 U.S. direct hire Foreign Service Contracting Officers, 4 US/TCN personal services contractors, and 10 localy hired A&amp;A professional and administrative staff.  The portfolio of awards managed by ROAA includes USAID's development and humanitarian assistance programs in the countries of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland, as well as cross border regional programs.  In addition, ROAA is also called upon periodically to provide A&amp;A support to USAID's Missions in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  USAID's programs in the region cover the gamut of development sectors and include important Presidential and Agency Initiatives, such as the USAID Forward Local Solutions, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Young African Leader's Initiative, the Power Africa Initiative, and the Global Climate Change Initiative.  ROAA's portfolio currently consistent of 129 acquisition and assistance awards with total estimated value of approximately USD $2 billion. <br /><br />USAID/SA ROAA is conducting market research to identify potential sources capable of providing acquisition and assistance support services to support its operations during calendar year 2016.  These A&amp;A services could include remote, task-based support provided from another location or continuous on-site presence at USAID's office in Pretoria.  A&amp;A actions can range in complexity from fixed price, simplified acquisition orders to large, multi-year, multi-million dollar cost reimbursement procurements.  Potential tasks could include:</p>
<p>-	preparation of pre-award planning documents<br />-	preparation of solicitations<br />-	receipt of proposals from offerors/applicants<br />-	providing instructions and oversight to a technical evaluation committee<br />-	review of technical evaluation report<br />-	cost and price analyses and cost realism analyses    <br />-	preparation of competition range determinations<br />-	exchanges with offerors/applicants<br />-	day-to-day contact and grant administration <br />-	quality control reviews of complex pre-award documentation<br />-	other A&amp;A related duties as assigned</p>
<p>USAID is particularly interested in identifying potential sources with mid- or senior level qualifications in the field of U.S. Federal Government acquisition and assistance support.  Ideally, potential sources would be highly knowledgeable in the award and management of both acquisition and assistance mechanisms, with more than 10 years of experience in soliciting, awarding and administering highly complex acquisition and assistance mechanisms in an overseas environment.  Knowledge of USAID policies and procedures would be highly desirable.  Proper knowledge of handling of procurement sensitive information and mitigating conflicts of interest would be essential, in addition to exceptional English language writing skills.  Periods of service could range between a few weeks to up to 6 months or more.</p>
<p>Individuals or entities capable of providing these types of services may e-mail information to: Camille Hasha, Contracting and Agreement Officer, at chasha@usaid.gov <strong>by 8:00 Pretoria local time on November 16, 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be received via email with "RFI for A&amp;A services" in the subject line of the email message.  Paper media or responses in any form other than email will not be considered.  Submissions must be in English and must not exceed the equivalent of three (3) pages in Times New Roman 12 point font.

Respondents are advised that USAID is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.  Any information submitted in response to this "sources sought" notice is voluntary.  The issuance of this request shall not restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach, if any.

<RESPDATE>102915
<CONTACT>Bruce E Hayes, Contract Specialist, Phone 2156566771, Email Bruce.E.Hayes@usace.army.mil
<DESC>It is the Government's intention to have a total of fifty (56) ALCO model 251-C marine engine cylinder heads overhauled. Contractor will provide all labor, parts, materials, equipment and services required to rebuild and overhaul engine cylinder heads in accordance with ALCO specifications MI-11020G, DRP-12200N, and DRP-12400H. It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the publications from FM/ALCO to assure they are using the most current information for the job.
<p>The Government realizes that numbers are constantly being revised or superseded, especially with GE/ALCO now being FM/ALCO under Coltec Industries, and now Fairbanks Morse/Alco Engine Div.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to ascertain which parts numbers have been changed and automatically use the newer parts numbers for parts, so long as the part being provided is still the exact same OEM part. If the parts themselves have been altered, then the contractor must notify the Government representative or Contracting Officer. The Contractor is to provide documentation to the origin of all parts used in overhauling the 251-C cylinder heads.</p>
<p>The ALCO 251 style engines are currently being used on board the U.S. Army Dredge McFARLAND. The correct rebuilt head is to be determined by written description of parts to be utilized more so then the part number. Much discussion arises from which part numbers are current versus those superseded. Again, the correct unit is to be determined by narrative description more so then part number.</p>
<p>The only reason an engine head casting is to be condemned is because of the lack of rebuilding ability, due to cracks, pitting, corrosion, or test failure. The repair facility must be willing to accept this condition prior to submission of quotes or accepting award of the purchase order.</p>
<p>AT THIS TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PURCHASE NEW STYLE HEADS</p>
<p>It is the intent of this acquisition to completely disassemble, thoroughly clean the ALCO engine heads and parts, then to rebuild, overhaul, test, and return to serviceability. The ALCO engine heads are for the 251-C model diesel engine. All work shall be in strict accordance with the all ALCO rebuilding instructions, bulletins, and service manual MI-110206; DRP-12200N; DPR-12400H, MI-11020G; and EB-11020.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: These requirements are to be completed in conjunction with the information provided by ALCO rebuilding specifications, requirements, and service manual MI-11020G, and applicable publications.</p>
<p>The Government will furnish to the contractor, the used heads. All shipping and transportation fees will be at the Contractor's expense and will be shipped to the contractor C.O.D., or they can be picked up by the Contractor or his representative at Fort Mifflin Distribution Center in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish under the contract the following parts, which must be authentic ALCO parts, except for hardware items.<br />1. All minor hardware, fittings, materials and tools to accomplish the work specified<br />2. One hundred twelve (112) 30-degree ALCO intake valves and seats (P/N 2231211 &amp; 22211817), with snap rings<br />3. One hundred twelve (112) 45-degree ALCO exhaust valves seats only<br />(P/N 22211815), with snap rings.<br />4. Two hundred twenty four (224) valves spring seats and locks<br />5. Two hundred twenty four (224) valve springs<br />6. Two hundred twenty four (224) valve guides</p>
<p>The contractor shall offer with his quote a warranty for parts, craftsmanship and workmanship for each engine head. This warranty shall be retained on file in case there is a need to undertake some warranty related repairs, at a later date. The warranty shall be set up for the number of operational hours rather than days.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) , Employee Services Division (ESD) Facility in Riverdale, Maryland intends to negotiate a firm fixed Priced 3 year follow on Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for calibration and cleaning services previously under warranty for 25 TSI Brand Portacounts currently in use at APHIS/ESD/SB.
<p>The TSI Brand PortaCounts used by APHIS/ESD/SB comply with current Avian Influenza respirator fit-testing requirements. This Respiratory Protection Program was developed to comply with OSHA and the specific requirements of the APHIS Program, and is mission critical to personnel.</p>
<p>APHIS currently has TSI Brand PortaCount units located nation-wide which are sent to the field for designated trained APHIS personnel to perform respirator fit-testing .</p>
<p><br />The current Quote is for each of the 25 Portacounts to have 3 calibrations. <br />Item description CLC3-8038<br />Serial numbers:</p>
<p>8038103903 8038103904 8038103907 8038103908<br />8038090608 8038084019 8038084023 8038084024<br />8038084025 8038084026 8038084027 8038092802<br />8038092813 8038092820 8038092821 8038092822<br />8038092823 8038092825 8038092901 8038092904<br />8038092905 8038092906 8038092907 8038092908<br />8038092909</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rationale used for permitting this noncompetitive acquisition is in accordance with FAR - 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>(a) Authority. <br />(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>The property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency</p>
<p>TSI is the Manufacturer for the PortaCounts used and they perform their own cleaning and calibration services. These services were previously under warranty.</p>
<p>In Accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (2) ( C ) (ii) Supplies or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The quote # 20073161 received by the Contracting officer will be processed immediately because it expires on 11/30/2015. Delay in award could cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and possible price increases for services.</p>
<p><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Central Time (CT) by November 13, 2015 . Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334512, and the size standard is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Carol Dingess, Contracting Officer , USDA/ APHIS/MRPBS/AAMD/2150 Centre Avenue<br />Building - B ( MS - 2E6)/Fort Collins, CO 80526, or via email @ Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ Fax: 970-472-1897 (Attn: Carol Dingess - 2E20).</p>

Information from this event and any future RFIs may be used to help the Navy determine the number, timing, structure (e.g., contract type), terms and conditions, and tasks of any potential contract(s) that may be issued as follow-ons to the current NGEN contract. As part of the days agenda, PMW 205 representatives and members of the Navy/USMC acquisition community will provide:  (1) present-day views of USN and USMC network scope and scale; and (2) conceptual views of the re-compete scope of effort, future portfolio of services, and future acquisition/procurement approach.  The Industry Day will incorporate panel discussions to facilitate the desired information exchange between Government and industry.  The Government intends to leverage service delivery infrastructure mechanisms that include: (a) the Navy Marine Corps Intranet; (b) the Marine Corps Enterprise Network; and, (c) the cloud, to include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS).  The key tenets of any potential future contracts include: global reach; speed to delivery; cloud-based services; innovation; mobility; data analytics; and, cybersecurity.  PMW 205 encourages small business participation in the Industry Day to increase the visibility of potential small business opportunities in the NGEN follow-on contracts.  Registration: Registration is limited by venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended to expedite event check-in. Attendees may register via e-mail by sending a request to NGEN_Industry_Day@navy.mil including your name, company name, CAGE, names of attendees (five maximum), phone number(s), and e-mail address.  Registered attendees will be provided additional information regarding directions, parking, check-in, etc., one week prior to the event. Registration on the day of the event will begin at 7:00 a.m. Please plan to arrive early.  Organizations are limited to five (5) attendees. However, in the event the Industry Day is over- or  under-subscribed, PMW 205 reserves the right to adjust participation limits as necessary. The cut-off date for pre-registration is November, 15 2015, at 1600 EST.  There is no fee for any Industry Day activity.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-15-C-4015 to Cleveland Clinic, awarded by SSC Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency Biological Technologies Office (DARPA/BTO) on 28 January 2015 for a base period of performance of 18 months followed by one (1) 30-month option and one (1) 12-month option.  The effort under the contract supports the DARPA BTO Hand Proprioception & Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program and proposes to develop a battery of validated functional metrics for bi-directionally integrated advanced prosthetic limb systems that will be adaptable to both advanced and current standard-of-care prosthetics, clinically implementable with a minimum requirement of technological expertise to operate, flexible to account for numerous systems approaches, and sensitive to system performance and reflective of requirements for quantifying different control and feedback strategies.  Based on the success to date of metrics development, the new effort under the modification will allow for additional patients to participate in Metrics validation.  With these additional patients the effort will provide significant additional statistical power to the metrics validation and is expected to move this technology forward to transition to warfighters.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541711- Research and Development in Biotechnology.  Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program, which has seen breakthroughs that will benefit from continued trials under this current contract.  It is expected that the technology will transition for use by the warfighter.  This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $178,730.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for 15 days. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Sabina Sabedra, Code 22530, SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-4522 or via email to sabina.sabedra@navy.mil.

<DESC>EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (EVD) PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) 
1.	 Purpose. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Emergency Management (OEM) has initiated a project to ensure that all VA Medical Centers are capable of responding to a highly infectious disease.  In order to achieve this goal, packaging of existing bulk PPE into Kits is required.  Therefore, there is a requirement to assemble approximately 95,000 individual Kits.  

2.	Background.  The VHA's experiences with preparedness and response to an outbreak of Highly Infectious Diseases, the H1N1 outbreak, and more recently the Ebola global threats, have mandated this requirement.  Currently, bulk shipments of the 12 items of PPE have arrived at the VA's warehouse in Chicago as a central location for reception.  VHA developed a plan for Kit assembly, and for delivery to 150 VA Medical Centers.  

3.	Objectives.  Contract the assembly of the bulk PPE products into Kits.  There will be two types of Kits: one basic EVD PPE Kit, and one containing the PAPR ensemble.  The contractor will receive the bulk product, unpack, sort, assemble into the required Kit type, load into individual Kits with two individual Packing Lists per Kit for quick content identification, and return palletized Kits as per the instructions in this work statement.  The raw product awaiting repackaging shall be stored in a dry environment and protected from temperature extremes.

4.	Scope. VA will provide the product to be packaged. The contractor shall procure the required packaging resources, supplies, and equipment to prepare the required Kits as instructed herein.  This will include receiving the bulk PPE products shipped from VA, unpacking, sorting, and assemblage of PPE items into individual Kits and placing each Kit into single-wall corrugated cardboard boxes, 12" X 9" X 6" (L X W X H),  ULine S-18339 or equivalent.  Each box will include two identical Packing Lists: one inside and one secured in place in a protective sleeve on the outside, for content identification.  Kits shall be palletized, with 80 Ebola PPE Kits and 25 PAPR ensemble Kits per pallet.  All packaging, Packing Lists, and other requirements for shipment shall be per instructions in Attachments 1 (packaging information) and 2 (packing list) to this PWS.  Final Kits shall be shipped to VA locations (scheduled, arranged, and paid by VA), with the remaining stock returned to the VA's central warehouse (scheduled, arranged, and paid by VA).

</strong>
<p align="left">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p align="left">1) Lowest Price</p>
<p align="left">2) Technically Acceptable</p>
<p align="left">PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p align="left">1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of reasonableness. Price analysis techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p align="left">2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p align="left">i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.</p>
<p align="left">ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price</p>
<p align="left">iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p align="left">TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE: The Government will evaluate offerors technical ability based on Offerors submission of proof of training in the form of certificates or formal documentation of manufacture sponsored training. Award will be made to the responsible offeror who meets minimum technical requirements at the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p align="left">(b) <em>Options. </em>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. If option year price increase is due to economic factor exluding wage increases, please provide supporting documentaion. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p align="left">i. The solicitation and subsequent award for this acquisition contains the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This option to extend the contract term is evaluated as part of the initial evaluation, so that any resultant exercise of this option is within scope of the pending contract. The inclusion of this clause provides up to six (6) months of continued performance when it is in the Government's best interest to continue performance after the end of the final contract performance period. If conditions warrant the exercise of this option, the price(s) for the continued performance under this clause shall be at the same price(s) as the prior performance period.</p>
<p align="left">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p align="left">(h) <em>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689)</em>. (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p align="left">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p align="left">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p align="left">(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p align="left">(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p align="left">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p align="left">(A) <em>The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p align="left">(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. </em>A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p align="left">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p align="left">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p align="left">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p align="left">(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p align="left">(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Due to the nature of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, there will be a minimum and maximum incorporated in the PS Form 8203 Schedule Language. <br /><br />The U.S. Postal Service ("USPS") does not offer a transportation subsidy as other federal agencies; we provide the opportunity to employees to elect to have a pre-tax deduction from their paycheck up to the IRS monthly spending limits.<br /><br />The supplier purchases public transportation fare media (such as subway, bus and vanpool passes, and fare cards) from transit authorities, pre-pays monthly parking expenses, and issues reimbursement checks for covered expenses as designated by USPS employees. Employees pay for these expenses through payroll purchase.<br />The supplier will install and support the Pre-Tax Commuter Benefit Administration Service (the "Program"), as described more fully in the Statement of Work (SOW).<br />

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for the purpose of requesting interested firms to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) expressing their desire to meet the Small Rocket Program (SRP) objectives and technical requirements.
<p>The Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, is contemplating the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in support of the Small Rocket Program (SRP) that provides RSLP with small launch vehicles capable of sub-orbital ballistic trajectories and/or 0-400lb orbital payloads to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and other defined test objectives. <br />This program will provide enhanced capability and flexibility in the development of commercial and/or RSLP sounding rocket launch vehicles and launch services, as well as small payload space lift launch vehicles and services, with the use of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or commercial boosters to meet a wide variety of mission requirements. The contractor will be required to integrate commercial stages, Minuteman, Peacekeeper and/or other solid rocket motors and liquid engine stages with government payloads. Contractor tasks include, but are not limited to: development of guidance and control systems; targeting launch vehicle; development of flight termination systems; resolution of range safety issues; providing launch services; and, performing post-launch analysis. It is anticipated that each SRP mission/effort will be competed among the IDIQ contract awardees. This will require, for most missions, the ability to develop, procure, and build flight hardware, and integrate and provide launch services from any of the national test/launch ranges, within 18-24 months from the time the delivery order is awarded. The ID/IQ contract ordering period is planned for seven years and will require flexibility in responding to unique technical requirements, vehicle quantity, and schedule changes. Dependent on the mission, the government may provide the following GFE: boosters, payload, facilities, launch vehicle transportation, and selected ground handling, launch, and support equipment.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting interested firms submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) expressing their desire and ability to meet the SRP objectives. The request for information (RFI) objective is to assess established and new/emerging small launch and /or target launch vehicle contractors. As the notice has been modified since the previous SRP-4 RFI, potential offerors who responded to the earlier request are asked to submit a new or updated SOC. In addressing the technical requirements (1-5) below, contractors are encouraged to describe their current launch vehicle capabilities and their plans to develop future capabilities. The SOC should contain pertinent and specific information addressing these areas: (A) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort relevant to the specific task areas of this effort; (B) Facilities: availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Please also provide brief responses outlining your: industrial security clearance and storage facilities to support work at the SECRET level; cost reporting process, including status of cost accounting system; and mission timeline requirement (an alternative, if not the 18 to 24 month timeline outlined above). The responses provided in the areas above should contain information demonstrating ability to meet the following technical requirements:</p>
<p>(1) Ability to design a variety of suborbital and/or small orbital launch vehicles using commercial and/or GFE stages, and other required hardware meeting all technical, mission, and safety requirements. This includes the ability to (a) design launch vehicles based on a range of motors and engines; (b) incorporate different national test range ground and safety requirements into the design of the launch vehicle systems; (c) design, develop, and test necessary modifications to the booster motor, to include guidance and control hardware and software, and attitude control systems capable of performing post-boost maneuvers.<br /><br />(2) Ability to perform a range of mission planning, targeting, and data analysis efforts. This includes ability to (a) target a variety of different launch vehicles or a single orbital launch vehicle; (b) coordinate mission parameters with outside agencies by providing trajectory data and vehicle characterization; (c) perform post-mission analysis of booster telemetry and sensor data.<br /><br />(3) Ability to fabricate and test necessary components and provide required modifications to the boosters and other required structures. This includes the ability to (a) manufacture and test attitude control hardware capable of performing required post-boost maneuvers; (b) fabricate, modify, integrate, and test guidance and control systems; (c) provide facilities, tooling, support, and test equipment for both hardware and software, which the contractor will maintain and utilize for testing, manufacturing, integration and analysis; (d) test hardware for vibration, shock humidity, and temperature for both individual components and integrated systems; (e) provide facilities to safely test individual components and integrated systems; (f) safely transport hardware, including rocket motors and pyrotechnic device; (g) obtain access to a manufacture and testing facility with facility clearance at the SECRET/NOFORN level.<br /><br />(4) Ability to plan and perform flight test operations from any government or commercially owned launch range (Reagan Test Site, Western Range, Eastern Range, Wallops Island, White Sands Missile Range, Kodiak Spaceport, Pacific Missile Range Facility, etc.). This includes: (a) planning launches from the range in accordance with relevant ground and flight safety requirements and mission requirements; (b) integrating and servicing boosters and payload using existing storage, missile assembly and integration and operations facilities.<br /><br />(5) Ability to provide program management activities, integrating systems engineering and other activities. This includes (a) experience interfacing with several independent payload contractors, government agencies, and range safety offices; (b) capability of efficiently integrating systems engineering disciplines such as configuration management, reliability, quality assurance, safety, manufacturing, etc.; (c) facilities and procedures for hosting SECRET/NOFORN meetings.</p>

<DESC>Electronic Warfare Technology Challenges<br />Request for Information (RFI)<br />October 2015<br /><br />Contact: The Electronic Warfare Community of Interest (EW COI), under the sponsorship of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)). <br /><br />Email: usarmy.apg.rdecom-cerdec.mbx.i2wd-ewcoi-rfi@mail.mil.<br /><br />Synopsis: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. The purpose of this notice is for the government to obtain market research information and gain an understanding of the marketplace. EW COI is seeking information from academia and industry regarding both internally-funded Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) efforts and externally funded (contract or grant) efforts that map to six EW Technology Challenge areas. Knowledge of these efforts is of significant interest for identifying investments being pursued inside and outside the Services, and will help provide information on advanced technology options for incorporation into the overall EW COI Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Roadmap.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This is a pre-solicitation RFI and the EW COI is currently conducting market research only. No award is intended as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse costs incurred by Respondent in response to this RFI, or for participating in information exchange regarding details of the RFI. <br /><br />Due Date: 3PM EST on&nbsp;30 November 2015. Pending a review of the responses, the quality of submission and the level of specification of the information provided, Government intends to down-select responses and may conduct follow up discussions (if needed) with Respondents. Please note however, the Government is under no obligation to conduct these follow-up Q&amp;A sessions. <br />Description: The 17 S&amp;T COIs were established in 2009 by OASD(R&amp;E) as a mechanism to encourage multi-agency coordination and collaboration in cross-cutting technology focus areas with broad multiple-Component investment. The COIs provide a forum for coordinating S&amp;T strategies across the Department, sharing new ideas, technical directions and technology opportunities, joint planning programs, measuring technical progress, and reporting on the general state of health for specific technology areas.<br /><br />The principal products of the COIs are strategic plans and roadmaps with a 20 year horizon that capture technical goals and mission impact. Their analyses identify common S&amp;T needs and the means by which they are being addressed, highlight development and investment gaps, and facilitate planning for future investigation and collaboration opportunities. These plans are used to guide long-term budget decisions and to influence near-term program priorities in each of the Components. <br /><br />The Electronic Warfare COI was formed to address the concern that rapidly evolving challenges to spectrum dominance threaten blue force lethality and survivability. By acting as the EW S&amp;T collaboration body for the DoD, the EW COI will define a cross-cutting EW S&amp;T investment strategy and recommendations. This involves the use of electromagnetic (EM) and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) or to attack the enemy while protecting our own EM systems against both intentional and unintentional interference. Technology efforts pertinent to these goals are organized under a taxonomy of six Technology Challenge (TC) areas. They are:<br />EW COI Technology Challenge (TC) Areas<br /><br />1. Cognitive/Adaptive Capabilities: Develop the ability to effectively outpace adversary decision and technical options.
<p>2. Distributed/Coordinated/Net-Enabled Systems: Achieve spatially and temporally diverse responsiveness to dense and complex threat environments.</p>
<p>3. Preemptive/Proactive Effects: Prevent or disrupt the adversary's ability to engage our forces.</p>
<p>4. Broadband/Multispectral Components and Systems: Enable the widest possible spectral extent to our control of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>5. Modular/Open/Reconfigurable Architectures: Achieve timely deployment or insertion of advanced EW capabilities in response to rapidly changing conditions.</p>
<p>6. Advanced Electronic Protection Techniques and Technology: Allow unfettered operations in the increasingly dense electromagnetic spectrum environment.<br /><br />Requested Information: The EW COI requests specific information regarding research and development efforts that pertain to the EW COI Technology Challenge areas, and will only review the following information:<br /><br />&bull; Section 1. Description of company or academic institution and expertise as pertains to EW.<br /><br />&bull; Section 2. List of IR&amp;D and externally funded efforts mapped to the EW technology challenges described above. For externally funded efforts identify the funding organization.<br /><br />&bull; Section 3. Description of each IR&amp;D and externally funded effort with explanation for why the program maps to its associated Technology Challenge area(s). List the planned funding ($K) for each identified effort in 2016 (specify either by government fiscal year or calendar year). Specification of current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) including justification and evidence for maturity assessment. <br /><br />&bull; Section 4. Projected technology roadmap in accordance with a current and/or sample funding plan to achieve a fielded capability for each effort<br /><br />o Be sure to specify which parts of the plan are currently funded vs. which parts are not funded<br /><br />o Future cost estimates, ROMs and information regarding funding amounts are NOT required for this RFI<br /><br />All compliant submissions must contain section headings and provide the information requested under the section in order to be evaluated. <br />Solutions already fielded by any Service should not be submitted. Additionally, technologies lower than TRL2 should not be submitted for this RFI.<br />Submission Requirements: All assumptions, including any assumed government support, shall be clearly identified.

<SOLNBR>W911NF15R0009
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>05292016
<CONTACT>Maria D. Nelson, Phone 9195414992, Email maria.d.nelson.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This notice is an update to the ARI TRAIN III requirement (W911NF-15-R-0009). The current ARI TRAIN II Multiple Award IDIQ contracts expire on 14 November 2015. The Army Contracting Command will not be hosting an Industry Day for ARI TRAIN III in fiscal year 2016. Instead, the ARI TRAIN III requirements will be solicited under the OASIS (One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services) program, http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/161367. The Task Order Requests will be solicited under Pool 2 of the OASIS program, which includes NAICS code 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) beginning in December 2015 or January 2016. <br />There will be future program announcements issued by the OASIS team to add new contractors to OASIS Pool 2, and this will be your opportunity to submit a proposal for consideration under OASIS. The Army Contracting Command has not made a final decision regarding whether or not a separate Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) program will be awarded for ARI TRAIN III. The OASIS program will be utilized and evaluated first prior to making any final decisions on a new MATOC. <br />The immediate opportunity is to become a subcontractor with an existing OASIS Pool 2 prime contractor. The list of OASIS prime contractors is available on the OASIS website. Figure what core competencies and value your organization brings to potential solutions, network with the OASIS Pool 2 prime contractors, and figure out the best ways to work together.
<p>A key step to becoming an OASIS prime contractor is being ready for an on-ramp when one happens. The BEST way to do this is to examine and understand the original OASIS and OASIS SB solicitations, http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/243631.</p>
<p>All on-ramp solicitations will be almost identical to the original solicitations. Familiarize yourself with the structure of OASIS, the Pools, the point system, relevant experience projects, pool qualification projects, etc. The better you understand the solicitations, the more you can do now to strengthen your potential score when the right on-ramp opportunity comes available.</p>
<br /><br />Information Regarding ARI TRAIN III: <br /><br />With the rapid changes in and proliferation of Army needs, the ARI must continue to support building and sustaining an all-volunteer Force composed of highly competent and resilient Soldiers, adaptive leaders, and cohesive teams of Army professionals. The envisioned procurement, the ARI TRAIN III program, will be in support of these aspects of ARI's mission: <br /><br />Analyzing Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training needs and requirements <br /><br />Design and development of exemplar or prototype methods for Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training <br /><br />Design, conduct, analysis, and assessment of research interventions in Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training <br /><br />Design, development, and evaluation of methods for the implementation and management of Soldier, leader, unit, and organizational development and training programs <br /><br />Design, development, evaluation, and incorporation of innovative state-of-the-art technology for efficiencies in Soldier, leader, unit and organizational development and training <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

DESCRIPTION

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Title X Part III (Public Law 111-11) signed on March 30, 2009, provided the authorization to construct this important project as a major component of the Navajo Nation San Juan River Basin Water Rights Settlement in New Mexico. 

An RFI (R15PS01052) was announced on May 22, 2015 which requested the following information.

1.	Questions for Design-Build Teams:
a.	Does your company have the capacity to permit, design, and build the CLWTP considering the information provided in this RFI and assuming there are no significant deviations from this information once more data is provided?
b.	Company point of contact, address, telephone number, and status of the company; (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.)
c.	Provide your companyÂ¿s portfolio as it relates to:
1.	Design-build in general.
2.	Specific application to water treatment facilities.
3.	Similar size/type of WTP needed for this project that you have designed and/or built.
4.	Highlight any innovative treatment (design or construction) techniques you have used to reduce cost and/or maintenance time.
d.	Describe your companyÂ¿s experience in designing water treatment plants for natural organic matter reduction, including but not limited to biofiltration and other treatment processes.
e.	Describe companyÂ¿s experience with water treatment operation under a Â¿design-build-operateÂ¿ scenario.
2.	Questions for Equipment Manufacturers, Representatives and Process Engineers:
a.	Suggested treatment processes with pertinent technical data sufficient to support manufacturerÂ¿s representations, operational requirements, costs (initial installation and operational), warranties and proprietary information.
b.	Market standard sizes, lay-outs, plans and specifications, space and power requirements, typical and maximum/minimum feed rates, typical replacement or service time requirements, and typical life cycle costs per 1,000 gallons for a water treatment plant of this size/capacity.
c.	Company information, such as socio economic status, size, market share, annual sales, length of time in business, length of time with this specific product.
d.	List of projects using this treatment process.

DESIGN DATA

A.  The CLWTP will serve the Eastern portion of the NGWSP and will consist of a water treatment plant (WTP) and pumping plant.  The Cutter Lateral obtains water from Cutter Reservoir, an existing regulating reservoir on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project.  

B.  Hydraulic Data
1.	WTP
The WTP will be designed and built for the 2020 demand with the capability of being expanded for the 2040 demand (Table 1).  The influent /effluent difference assumes an approximate 4% required maximum loss through the WTP.

Table 1:  Year 2020 and 2040 water demands
Units	Demand	2020	2040
		Influent	Effluent	Influent	Effluent
MGD	Maximum Day	4.0	3.8	5.6	5.4
	Average Day	3.1	3.0	4.3	4.2
	Minimum Month	2.5	2.4	3.5	3.3

2.	Pumping Plant
Pumping Plant shall be designed for sufficient head (420 feet) to pump water to proposed operating storage tank elevations at the following flow rates (Table 2):


Table 2:  Year 2020 and 2040 pumping plant flow rates
Year	Units
	(CFS)	(GPM)
2020	5.9	2,700
2040	8.3	3,800





C.  Water Quality Data
1.	Raw Water Quality
The source water is a reservoir with a good water quality.  See the 4/6/2015 water sample highlighted water quality results (Table 3).

Table 3:  Highlighted water quality results (4/6/2015 sample)

	Analyte	Value	Units
General	Alkalinity (Total)	81	mg/L
	DOC	2.5	mg/L
	Hardness	101	mg/L as CaCO3
	pH	8.1	
	TDS	160	mg/L
	TOC	2.6	mg/L
	TSS	4.5	mg/L
	Turbidity	4.5	NTU
	UV	0.079	cm-1
Ions	Arsenic	0.001	mg/L
	Bromide	<0.2	mg/L
	Chloride	<10	mg/L
	Iron	0.14	mg/L
	Manganese	0.002	mg/L
	Sodium	15	mg/L
	Sulfate	45	mg/L

2.	Finished Water Quality
a.	Finished water must meet all USEPA primary and secondary drinking water standards.  
b.	The primary finished water quality parameter of concern is natural organic matter and the resulting disinfection byproduct formation.  This is due to the long distribution system length.  
c.	The finished water DOC concentration will need to be approximately 0.5 mg/L.

D.  Treatment Constraints 
1.	Â¿96% overall WTP water recovery
2.	Use of chloramines is not permitted

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may have an upcoming requirement for Video Teleconferencing as a Service. This requirement may support the entire FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT).  The areas of service coverage are both CONUS and OCONUS.

Attachment entitled, âScope for VTC as a Service_Market Surveyâ is included for informational purposes only to outline the broad scope of the envisioned work.  

This market survey is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small business concerns.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of capabilities from interested parties who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8(a)), Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the requirement among small business concerns.  Responses from large business will not be considered at this time.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes anticipated for this effort is 518210 Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services with a size standard of $32.5 Million. A secondary NIAC code that may be considered for this effort is, 517911 Telecommunications Resellers with a size standard of 1,500 employees. 
In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO PAGE LIMITATION, HOWEVER SUBMISSIONS SHOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT CONCISE INFORMATION ONLY.


Capability Statement â This document should identify:

1. Your companyâs capability to provide supplies and services to the agency as described by  the attachment entitled, âScope for VTC as a Service_Market Survey,â including geographical areas where your company can provide services.

2. Any relevant current or previous experience that includes not more than three contracts for the same or similar services completed within the last five years or still ongoing.

Additional Submissionsâ

1. Completed Business Declaration Form, and any SBA certification letters (if applicable)

2. Comments concerning the Market Survey are welcome and optional.  

The FAA will consider all comments received.
All submissions in response to this market survey must be received by 05:00 pm EST on November 10, 2015.  Send response via email to elizabeth.ford@faa.gov.  Phone calls regarding this survey will not be entertained.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requires engineering and mechanical services to retrofit the HVAC system and complete related tasks in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building in Kihei, Maui Island, Hawaii (Maui County).  

The Kealia Pond Headquarters/Visitor Center Building is a fairly new building. Construction was completed and the building was initially occupied in February 2012. The Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) system in the building is a central station air handling unit with (4) 6-ton fan cooling units and (1) 1-ton fan cooling unit along with air cooled water chillers manufactured by the Trane Company.  The climate in Hawaii is humid particularly in the winter months when the temperatures are cooler and the precipitation levels increase. The building is located in a wetland area downwind of agricultural operations and near the ocean, and recently surface mold has been found on internal walls.

Magnitude of project is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  Period of performance is 180 days from issuance of notice to proceed. Proposals that exceed $150,000.00 and that do not include a twenty (20) percent bid bond of the total price quoted with their proposal submission will be considered nonresponsive.  The successful awardee will be asked to provide a 100 percent payment and performance bond within 15 days of award.  Project is restricted to small businesses.  Applicable NAICS code is 238220.  Small business size is defined as $15 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  

Site Visit - Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, November 3, 2106 at 10 AM local time.  If attending the site visit please contact Courtney Brown at office phone (808) 268-6316 and directions will be provided on where contractors will meet.   Questions from the site visit need to be email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov by close of business Thursday, November 5, 2016.  Those questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment the following week.  

Scope of Work:  The Contractor shall provide engineering and installation services to modify the HVAC system in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building.  More specifically the Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and materials necessary to complete the listed tasks.  This includes three base tasks: Install electric reheat per construction drawings provided, move two outside air intakes, and modify building controls & Graphical User Interface (GUI) Graphics. Five separately priced options may be awarded based on government need and available resources. Option 1: design and install Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) fans in the four AH units with the electric reheat coils, Option 2: design and add 15kW of solar panels & appurtenances to existing PV system, Option 3: clean ducts, Option 4: One Year HVAC Maintenance Services Contract, Option 5: design and add chiller hot side coil reheat if feasible.  In conjunction with the requirements of the basic contract, the Contractor shall procure and install any new equipment, service disconnects, power cable runs, and/or distribution panels as necessary to meet current National Electrical Code (NEC) and National Electrical Safety standards.  

No government equipment or materials shall be provided during the contract unless arranged and agreed upon prior to use with the Refuge Manager. Normal duty hours are Monday through Friday 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. Work shall be performed during these hours unless prearranged with the Refuge Manager.  Federal holidays not included. 

Source selection process will be trade off.  Government will make a best overall value/benefit decision taking into account the following factors: Technical Capability, Experience, Past Performance and Price. Technical Capability, Experience and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than Price. The Government may award using the proposal that is effectively ranked with the highest points and determined to be the best value to the Government considering all of these evaluation factors. 

Solicitation Number F16PS00013 and attachments will be posted to FedBizOpps hereafter with proposals due on September 19, 2015 at 3PM PDT.  No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.

<DESC>The original Request for Information (RFI) was posted on September 4, 2014. SSA's plans have changed with regard to this potential procurement. It is now anticipated that the need for offsite vaulting services will continue for only one year (a base period), with the possibility of one additional year (an option period) at a substantially reduced level. It is also anticipated that the quantities identified previously (i.e., 1400 tapes daily/Urbana, 688 tapes daily /North Carolina, and 30 tapes daily/Baltimore) will be reduced although it is not known at this time by how much. <br /><br />SSA is seeking to identify vendors that would be 1) interested in responding to this potential procurement and 2)&nbsp;capable of providing the anticipated required services. <br /><br />If you have already responded to this RFI, please respond again indicating if you would still be interested given the anticipated changes. If you did not respond to the previous RFI, please refer to the original notice for questions and required information. <br /><br />Pricing data is not required. This is not a request for proposals or an announcement of a solicitation. No solicitation package exists at this time. In addition, the government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information received and submittals will not be returned to the sender. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>102915
<CONTACT>Danielle Pena, Phone 3014435148, Email danielle.pena@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The following pre-solicitation notice has been updated to clarify the Government's&nbsp;intent to sole source to Lockheed Martin as&nbsp;follows:<br /><br />The U.S. Health and Human Services intends to perform the following contract actions:
<p>1. Modify Lockheed Martin contract HHSP23320095401JI to increase the scope of work using the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This acquisition is in support of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) information technology support, products and services. Currently, the HHS Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT support to the Office of the Security and its associated Staff Divisions and Operating Divisions. This support provides the full gamut to its customer base including managed desktop support in which a "seat" includes the computing device, ancillary equipment, and services support. This model is delivered as a contractor-owned, contractor operated (COCO) managed desktop services contract that projects the life of a computing device over four (4) years. The model does not allow HHS OCIO to respond quickly to security mandates such as: operating system changes, vulnerability management, and more stringent security postures. The recent CyberSprint activities that came as a result of security breaches across the Federal enterprise created a mandate to restrict remote access to network resources using personally owned devices and weak authentication methodologies. HHS OCIO in response to the changing threat landscape developed a strategy to address the inherent security gaps in remote access from both an endpoint and authentication perspective. That strategy includes moving to a government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) model for managed desktop acquisition and support. This GOCO model was not included in the original scope of the competitively awarded IDIQ contract; therefore, PSC intends to modify the existing IDIQ contract and task order to add the GOCO model. This acquisition model will allow HHS OCIO to expeditiously field government furnished equipment (GFE) to the segment workforce currently connecting to HHS network resources via personally owned equipment. The GOCO model enables the imaging, testing and burn-in to occur at the manufacturer's site thereby delivering a secure product to the end user. From an authentication perspective, the GFE represents the furtherance of HHS OCIO's success in PIV deployment. By mandating and providing GFE computers to all staff requiring access to network resources remotely, HHS OCIO, in essence, mandates PIV usage and two-factor authentication. As a result of the aforementioned security considerations, the Government has an immediate requirement to provide Government owned equipment to its customers. Lockheed Martin is currently providing the COCO services on the existing task order (HHSP23320095401JI/HHSP23337001T) hence the need for a modification to the task order to include the GOCO services immediately to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. Lockheed Martin is the only source that can provide GOCO services to meet the Agency's immediate requirement now with no transition time; until a competitive acquisition can be conducted which the Government anticipates conducting in late quarter 1 or early quarter 2 of fiscal year 2016.<br /><br />The period of performance for the GOCO support model is award of the modification through September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541513 and the size standard is $27.5M. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements and can demonstrate the ability to provide immediate services to support GOCO devices upon award with no transition time may submit a written response via email to Danielle Pe&ntilde;a at the email address below by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on October 29, 2015.
