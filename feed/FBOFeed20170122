<DESC>Synopsis: <br />Pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), intends to negotiate a sole source basis an order with CW Government Travel, Inc. 4300 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22203 USA
<p>Acquisition purpose and objectives:<br />The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) requires continued support by the incumbent in providing official travel management services for United States Army sites Travel Area 1; USA CONUS.</p>
<p>Project background:<br />The DTMO requires the continuation of official travel management and related additional services on a point of sale basis for Department of Defense (DoD) travelers assigned to United States Army sites in Travel Area 1, USA CONUS. These CTO services are to support official travel activities of authorized DoD travelers who are under the authority of the referenced locations. Official travel is travel (e.g., TDY, PCS, evacuation, travel by Reserve Component members, and civilians on invitational travel orders) in connection with official business of the United States Government and performed under orders at the expense of federal appropriated funds. These CTO services shall be provided using both traditional methods and automated methods using the Defense Travel System (DTS) web portal.</p>
<p>HHS issued the current bridge contract on to provide time to recompete the Travel Area 1 US Army CONUS requirement on a full and open basis to the entire vendor community. A new bridge to extend Travel Areas 1's commercial travel services is necessary due to the current backlog of CTO contracts needing new awards caused by multiple protests on similar DTMO Commercial Travel procurements.</p>
<p>Use of other than full and open competition:<br />This is a sole source requirement to the incumbent CW Government Travel, Inc. CW Government Travel, Inc.is not the only company capable of performing these services; however, they are the only company capable of providing continued services to prevent a break in service. Other vendors would not be able to perform the services required without a break in service, as they would not have time to get their operation up and running in time, as it typically takes 90 days to transition a new vendor. During the transition process, interviewing agents to hire, sites visits, equipment purchase/delivery, coordination the transfer of phone lines, internet, and negotiating with the incumbent CTO to purchase equipment they won't need since they no longer have the contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of this interim solution is to provide the government with ample time to conduct this new procurement whilst ensuring no detrimental loss of service to DoD caused by unacceptable delays and service disruptions.</p>
<p>This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
