<DESC>Recovery  The purpose of the proposed modification 0002 to this BPA call is to provide incremental funding in the amount of $1,310,000.00 and to increase the not to exceed value of the BPA call to $3,079,208.00 and to extend the period of performance through 30 Sep 2010. Due to the unknown level of effort required to meet the contracting and grants and agreement support needs of the Economic Recovery Operations Center (EROC) located in Vallejo, CA, this requirement has been awarded and modified as a time and materials type contract. The labor rates are fixed price; however, the exact number of hours of support required for each labor category cannot be established in advance of the award.

ACC provides forces for the five geographical, unified commands - U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Northern Command including air defense forces for the North American Aerospace Defense Command. As a force provider, ACC organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of peace and wartime air sovereignty and air defense missions. ACC prepares combat air forces to globally implement national policy by sponsoring the ATLANTIC STRIKE (AS) Exercise Program. AS is designed to provide realistic training in the conduct of the counter-land close battle for combat Aircrews, Joint Terminal Air Controllers, Intelligence, and Air Support Operations Squadron personnel.

Review attached Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>This requirement is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541519 (Other Computer-Related Services).</p>
<p>This is a Firm Fixed Price Contract.</p>
<p>Section 1: Price (Not to exceed 3 pages. Page size 8.5 x 11). If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified. Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or a comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate. Price will be evaluated on the total overall price and reasonableness. A combination of evaluation techniques will be accomplished IAW FAR 15.404-1(b). The Government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
