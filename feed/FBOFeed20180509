<DESC>The RRB is an independent agency in the Executive branch of the Federal government. The RRB's primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement/survivor and unemployment/sickness insurance benefit programs for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). The RRB also administers aspects of the Medicare program and has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act and Internal Revenue Code. The RRB headquarters is located at 844 N. Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The RRB currently employs approximately 900 employees who work in its headquarters and in 53 field offices across the continental United States in localities easily accessible by large numbers of railroad workers. <br /><br />The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) intends to acquire, via full and open competition, disability medical examination services. The RRB anticipates that the services will begin in&nbsp;October 2018 for the base period services plus option year(s). It is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for the base services plus optional services as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors will be required to submit technical and price proposals. The Government anticipates that the resultant contract will be awarded on a best value basis where the technical volume will be considered more important than the price proposal.
<p>Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading on the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about May 25, 2018.&nbsp; The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP. Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto. The Government will not pay for the information received in response to the RFP, nor will the Government reimburse for any questions submitted.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the RRB. By submitting an offer, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for the RRB to refuse to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to submission of their offer. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>The RRB will not respond to any inquiries regarding this announcement.</p>
