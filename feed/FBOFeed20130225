<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Black-I Robotics, Inc., 141 Middlesex Rd. Suite 4, Tyngsboro, MA 01879 for the purchase of the following service:
<p>Services to alter three robots based on the analysis and design provided (wiring schematic, list of materials and specifications, and installation manual), support transferring the device wiring and control software from the small embedded computer to the new larger computer to provide flexible software research environment. Engineering calculations are required and original equipment and product warranty must be maintained.<br /><br />Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 811212.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:<br /><br />a. The LandShark was designed and manufactured by Black-I Robotics, Inc. They have the engineering expertise and manufacturing facilities to design and fabricate new wiring harnesses which will be required to properly install and support the new larger computer providing a flexible software research on the LandShark. Black-I also has the assembly and disassembly expertise which will be critical in ensuring the LandSharks are not damaged or weakened by improper removal or reassembly of structural members of the LandShark during the re-wiring process. <br /><br />b. As the LandShark manufacturer, Black-I Robotics, Inc. will guarantee that the LandShark integrity and strength will be maintained if they accomplish the re-design of the structural members and perform the installation of the re-wired harnesses. They will not provide a continued warranty of the LandShark if another company performs this work. Consequently, if a firm other than Black-I were to perform the re-wire, that firm would be required to support continued warranty terms.<br /><br />c. If the re-wire requirement is not met, the DARPA High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) research program will come to a halt, as the current computer is not capable of performing the computations for the research required to successfully demonstrate the HACMS objectives. <br /><br />No other Company is known to be available that could ensure that if configuration control issues were encountered that they would be able to resolve them and ensure that the software remains certified and accredited without requiring additional resources incurring a delay to the DMS installation.</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span>

<p>Destination Information: STOCK @ New Cumberland, PA</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule:300 Days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 3/12/13. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: ISOTTA FRASCHINI MOTORI SPA (A0106). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />( X ) Various Quantity Increments Solicited:</p>
<p>FROM: TO:<br />1 - 10<br />11 - 20<br />21 - 25<br />26 - 32</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc has a requirement for Renewal of WYLE Level I, II, II Maintenance Support. Arcata Associates, Inc intends to purchase the items from WYLE TELEMETRY AND DATA SYSTEMS 44417 Pecan Court California, MA 20619 This annual licensing agreement procurement supports an existing NASA DFRC capability (Western Aeronautical Test Range WATR), this capability provides for the processing of flight data archive files produced by the Wyle Omega telemetry front-end system.  This Wyle Omega front-end system is currently in use by the WATR. The estimated period of performance for this procurement will commence January 28, 2012 and continue through January 27, 2013 This procurement will be awarded as a sole source.  Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division will be responsible for delivering the software licensing and maintenance identified in the purchase request. This procurement will be procured under statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)). Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division is the only responsible source which is capable of satisfying the agency's unique need for the following reasons: a.	Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division developed the ODE software and the telemetry front-end system to which it interfaces. Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division possesses the detailed knowledge for all aspects of the telemetry front-end system and the proprietary data file formats, which is unavailable to another firm. Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division owns the unique detailed design information and has personnel with the knowledge and ability to interface to the telemetry data system files and to perform the processing necessary.  The personnel and design information are critical in implementing the required capabilities b.	Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division, as the sole producer of the ODE software and licensing and maintenance support specified has the unique capabilities required to produce this solution.  Due to the proprietary nature of the intellectual property, Wyle Telemetry and Data Systems Division is the only firm that can provide these required services and materials.	 c.	Schedule risk and cost will be significantly reduced through the utilization of an existing unique capability identical to that currently used by the WATR.  The time and cost of a detailed technical analysis of the capabilities provided by the Wyle ODE software will be avoided, and the time and cost of the development of an alternate solution will also be avoided. Arcata Associates, Inc. does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on March 12, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by  Arcata Associates, Inc not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of Arcata Associates, Inc.. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /><br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 142E,<br />Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch, plans to procure the brand name BD FACSJazz cell sorting system manufactured by BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard in 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery: 60 days after receipt of purchase order</p>
<p>The acquisition of the proposed BD FACSJazz sorter will enable the development of novel cell products that are compatible with patient treatment and will allow sorting of T cell subsets for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Isolation of T cell populations with specific properties, both from tumor preparations (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) as well as peripheral blood, could positively impact the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer therapies for the treatment of cancer, including metastatic melanoma. The contractor shall provide and install a 6-color BD FACSJazz FACS sorter, which is vital to translate NCI's findings in the lab to a clinical application. This cytometer is equipped with a replaceable fluidics path and the biosafety cabinet to enable sterile sorts that are compatible with sorting cells for patient treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: <br />1) one BD FACSJazz 20 inches x 20 inches using BD FACS Sortware;<br />2) BD FACSJazz AMO; <br />3) BD Pump Vacuum Service Assembly<br />4) Compressor Oil Free for BD FACSJazz;<br />5) Cart for BD FACSJazz 48 inches x 32 inches x 37;<br />6) BAKER SterilGARD e3 Optimax for FACSJazz.</p>
<p><strong>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</strong></p>
<p>1. Statute: 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501-(a)(1)<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source.<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, or industrial mobilization). <br /><br />No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p>The BD FACSJazz has a 488nm and 640nm laser. Each laser has spatial separation with individual focal points which allows for easy alignment and lower compensation. A Bubble detector in the sample line detects air bubbles from the sample tube and stops sample flow when the sample tube is empty, preventing air bubbles from reaching the nozzle assembly and comprising sort performance. The acquisition rate is 200,000 events per second independent of the number of parameters collected. At 27 PSI and 30 kHz with an average threshold rate of 10,000 events per second, a two-way sort achieved a purity of 98% and yield greater than 80% of Poisson's expected yield for both populations. It measures 20 inches x 20 inches to fit in a compact Biosafety cabinet. The Biosafety cabinet has been engineered specifically by Baker to fit and enclose the FACSjazz with specific requirements such as outlets,and most importantly, the FACSjazz has a quick-exchange nozzle assembly and exchangeable fluidics to decrease the risk of cross-contamination with foreign biological agents such as bacteria, viruses, and DNA. Replacement fluidics kits are gamma irradiated to ensure sterility. The Accudrop technology allows the operator to easily calibrate drop delay due to live video feed of the breakoff point, waste collection, and side streams while running the Accurdrop beads.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 12, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Debbie Brock, Contract Specialist, Deborah.Brock@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in SAM.gov. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130040-DB &not; on all correspondence.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No bids will be accepted from bidders proposing to use another firm?s GSA schedule, even if they have permission of the firm to use it. The bidder must be the owner of the GSA schedule in order to bid and to be considered for award. Bids that do not comply with this offer term will be removed from consideration.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>Bid prices for EACH line item must be accurate, fair, and reasonable, as determined by the contracting officer, using competitive price comparisons, market research, etc. Bundling multiple line item prices together (?materially unbalanced? pricing) is NOT acceptable, unless that exact bundle is listed as a single CLIN on the bidder?s contract. Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract modification to the current Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Cooperative Engagement Capability Production contract with Raytheon Company Network Centric Systems (NCS), 1501 72nd Street, North, P.O. Box 12248, St Petersburg, Florida, 33170-2248. This modification to existing contract N00024-12-C-5231 will provide continued production for FY12 FY14 with one (1) base year and two (2) option years.  NAVSEA Contracts intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CEC Production requirement for FY13 through FY14 within the next three (3) months.  NAVSEA Contracts, in cooperation with IWS 6.0, anticipates awarding the competitive CEC Production contract in the 1st Quarter of FY14.
  To prevent unacceptable delays and a stop gap in CEC Production for FY 13, the Government has deemed the issuance of a one year sole source contract necessary to fulfill the Navys CEC requirement.   The two (2) one-year options will be incorporated into the contract modification to allow for unforeseeable delays in issuing the competitive contract.   NAVSEA intends to award a contract modification resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as Raytheon NCS is the only company that can meet the Navy's current CEC Production requirement while the competitive contract is in the process of being completed.

Cooperative Engagement Capability is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units.
 CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies.

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may respond to this synopsis with a letter of capability and interest, or may submit an unsolicited proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) intends to solicit and negotiate a contract to accomplish repairs to the Emergency Diesel Generator Fuel Control Linkage onboard the USS HAMPTON (SSN-767).  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Fairbanks-Morse Engines, address:  1545 Tidelands Ave, National City, CA 91950.

<DESC>On behalf of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) solicits research proposals meeting the goal and purpose of the Partnership Program outlined in Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201. Any NOPP member agency may fund research in response to this solicitation; however, other agencies' terms of award may vary from the provisions of this BAA. <br /><br />Topic 1: Advancing Air-Ocean-Land-Ice Global Coupled Prediction on Emerging Computational Architectures<br /><br />Background <br /><br />Improvements in oceanographic and meteorological scientific understanding as well as predictions and projections of the earth's physical system are increasingly reliant on higher resolution models, model ensembles, and explicit coupling of the physical components into simulations where the ocean, atmosphere, wave and ice fields are allowed to co-evolve during the forward time integration. However, the increased computational demand that these efforts require is beyond current research and operational computational capacity and is projected to grow faster than traditional computational infrastructure increases can support. Additionally, capacity growth in the current generation of multi-core systems is becoming limited not only by acquisition cost but also by power, cooling, memory, and communications rather than processor speed. Emerging "commodity-based" processors such as Many-Integrated Cores (MIC) and Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) show promise for addressing these trends with projected 10-times theoretical improvement and likely at least 2-4 times improvement in realized cost and power requirements; and there are several national-level efforts to provide Peta-flop computing for computationally intensive research areas such as the environmental modeling and simulation community. <br /><br />While developmental models can be structured "in-stride" in the underlying numerics and dynamics to fully exploit these new computational architectures, there is a need to revise the established environmental prediction models whose supporting physics, dynamics, data assimilation, accuracy and performance for different processes and case studies is well understood, stable and well characterized at a range of spatial resolutions and forecast lead times. Additionally, next generation coupled ensemble forecast systems will likely require common source code that can optionally take advantage of both legacy and emerging computational capacity to address reliability and consistency of results from these highly complex models on heterogeneous architectures. <br /><br />Topic Description <br /><br />A significantly improved capability to simulate and predict the coupled global air-ocean-wave-land-ice system at eddy-resolving spatial scales in a computationally and operationally efficient and massively parallel architecture towards real-time, predictions is desired. Responders to this announcement should propose work in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Department of Energy (DOE), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and/or National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) laboratories; and should consider an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, oceanographic and meteorological scientists, numerical methods experts, and software engineers. Familiarity with code refactoring and emerging many core accelerators, and portability to multiple platforms as well as automated or semi-automated re-coding tools is desired. Appropriate High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for these projects will be provided via the partnering agencies or outside of this solicitation and should not be included in the cost proposal, although scope of required computational assets should be estimated. Collaborators that are funded outside of this proposal should include an estimate of their relevant funded efforts and a letter endorsement of their ability and willingness to support this project should it be selected. Projects will use the Navy, DOE and NOAA's component models and will conduct research towards the following scientific and engineering goals: <br /><br />&bull; Predictive simulations on heterogeneous architectures Central Processing Unit (CPU), MIC, GPU: identification of representative code patterns that either look particularly amenable or intractable to refactoring; establishment of pathways to maintain single source code compatible with multiple platforms; and determination of mechanisms to achieve optimal performance and portability. <br /><br />&bull; Identification of key bottlenecks in component models such as Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), Global Forecast System (GFS), Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), High Resolution Atmospheric Model (HIRAM), Non-Hydrostatic Icosahedral Model (NIM), Community Earth System Model (CESM), Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), Modular Ocean Model (MOM), Community Ice Code (CICE), and WAVEWATCH 3 and minimization of the impact in resulting systems. <br /><br />&bull; Identification or development of software tools to facilitate code porting to maximize performance, assess memory and communication infrastructures efficiently, and minimize cross-platform communication and data copies. <br /><br />&bull; Addressing of language based or directive based compiler solutions in coordination with a model developers working group across similar national efforts at NOAA, NCAR, DOE, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). <br /><br />&bull; Assessment of the performance in terms of speed and accuracy of the resulting multi-platform versions of the component models, coupling interfaces, data-assimilation, and post-processing against the current modeling suite. <br /><br />&bull; Use of these new multi-platform versions in the representation of air-sea coupled processes such as tropical cyclones, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), or the sub-seasonal to annual Arctic sea-ice evolution in coordination with the Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) initiative (www.espc.oar.noaa.gov). <br /><br />&bull; Creation of a working group of dynamical and observational environmental scientists, process modelers, model developers, and computer scientists to assess model performance and provide recommendations. <br /><br />One technical goal of this topic is, by the end of the collective efforts, to produce a data-assimilative, eddy-resolving, high-resolution air-ocean-land-ice coupled prediction system suitable for medium-range to seasonal forecasts that might begin the transition process to U.S. operational environmental prediction centers. The NOPP-funded groups would collectively perform the background scientific research necessary to design and test such a model, including the data assimilation component. <br /><br />Efforts funded under this announcement should plan to participate in at least semi-annual meetings with related efforts in NOAA, NCAR, DOE, and NASA's model development communities conducting similar research and may be asked to consider common benchmarks or approaches to facilitate collaboration and success metrics.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />KC-135 R/T Air Refueling Fuel Vapor Protection
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) is for the KC-135R/T and OC-B. There is not solicitation available at this time. This RFI is published for Market Research purposes only. Participation in this RFI is optional and not required in order to respond to any subsequent procurement this Contracting Agency may take. Any information used will be on a non-attribution basis. Restrictions that would limit the Government's ability to use the information for these purposes are of limited value to the Government and are discouraged. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI is strictly for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE<br />The AFLCMC/WKDM Program Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost and schedule to procure an upgrade to existing air refueling (AR) and refueling receptacle (ARR) manifolds. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on providing dual fuel vapor barrier protection that could be installed on AR and ARR manifolds across the KC-135 R/T fleet.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />If a rubber seal fails on an ARR or AR manifold there is no secondary seal or safe drain to keep fuel separate from the crew compartment. Leaking ARR manifolds introduce fuel into the flight deck near the area of the navigator's station. AR manifold leaks can introduce fuel in the boomer's pod and accumulate in the boom sight window and floor.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION <br />AFLCMC/WKKPA is requesting information pertaining to the procurement of 396 AR and 11 ARR manifold upgrade designs. Fuel manifold leaks into the cabin and crew compartment where ignitions sources may exist which could potentially result in cabin fire/explosion. AFLCMC/WKDM aims to mitigate this serious risk by procuring AR and ARR manifold upgrade kits able to provide dual fuel vapor barrier protection.</p>
<p>The current system utilizes one o-ring at each pipe junction. When the o-ring fails there is nothing in place to prevent fuel from entering the crew compartment.</p>
<p>For ARR equipped aircraft, the following apply:<br />There are a total of seven junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends. There are a total of two couple joints with one o-ring on the top and bottom.</p>
<p>For AR equipped aircraft, the following apply:<br />There are a total of four junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends.</p>
<p>The dimensions of these pipes are not available due to restricted rights.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. All responses must be unclassified.</p>
<p><br />Response <br />Responses shall address:<br />1. Technical details of design<br />2. Program Estimated Cost information (ROM) for design<br />3. Delivery schedule/product availability of 396 AR manifold kits<br />4. Delivery schedule/product availability of 11 ARR manifold kits</p>
<p>Interested firms should also include the following in their response:</p>
<p>- Company Name and address<br />- CAGE Codes (if available)<br />- Point of Contact<br />- Size of Business (i.e. Large/Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concerns, Minority-owned business)<br />- U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity</p>

<DESC>Field Artillery Survey System Technology <br> Purpose:  The Army Contracting Command (ACC) New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey on behalf of the Joint Program Manager Office Towed Artillery Systems (PM-TAS) and Research Development and Engineering Command - Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) to identify technology currently available to refresh the Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System with Global Positioning System (IPADS-G).   <br> Description: This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of PM-TAS or RDECOM-ARDEC. The purpose of the IPADS-G system is to provide accurate navigational and survey data to the war fighter at the unit level. The primary intent is to support howitzer fire missions by obtaining accurate Survey Control Points (SCPs) and to lay azimuths for indirect fire. In doing so, the IPADS-G provides a common grid at the accuracies required to support indirect fire missions as opposed to standalone GPS systems which provide an absolute GPS solution. The intent of this Sources Sought is to identify qualified vendors that have available technology capable of meeting the current IPADS-G performance requirements in a smaller form factor and which also provide the capability of being upgraded to meet future emerging requirements.  For each available technology, interested vendors are requested to provide a white paper summarizing the following elements of their proposed design: <br>  <br> a.	Design Description.  All interested vendors are requested to provide a brief description of their design, including a list of the major design elements, a description of how they are integrated, and an explanation of how those elements  interface with each other.   <br>  <br> b.	 Technical Requirements.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of their proposed design against the following technical requirements.   <br>  <br> -	Performance and Environmental Requirements.  The system should be capable of meeting all current IPADS-G performance requirements, and capable of operating and surviving in all current IPADS-G environments (see  MIL-PRF-52955D) <br> -	 Physical Requirements.  The complete system (including any required batteries, cables and/or mounting hardware not specific to the vehicle) should have a maximum combined weight of no greater than 60 pounds (Threshold), 40 pounds (Objective).  <br> -	 Interface Requirements.  The system should be capable of being employable and transportable in a wide range of ground and air platforms .  The system should be capable of being configured for simple and rapid exchange between supporting platforms without permanent modification to the platform or itself. <br> -	 Power Requirements.  The system should be capable of using the host platform's electrical power to operate.  The system should possess an internal battery to power the system when not powered by the host platform.  This internal battery shall be charged by the host platform during operation. <br>  <br> c.	 Design Readiness.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of the technical and manufacturing readiness of their design.  If the design is in production, all interested vendors are requested to provide a summary statement on the number of units produced.   <br>  <br> d.	GPS M-Code compliance.  All interested vendors are to provide an assessment of their designs current and future compliance with GPS-M code. <br>  <br> e.	Digital Communications.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of their design's current and potential future ability to accept digital communications.   <br>  <br> f.	 Cost. All interested vendors are requested to provide a Rough Order Magnitude of the projected costs of their design in the following areas: <br> -	Non Recurring Engineering and Qualification <br> -	Unit Production Cost for quantities of 1 to 100, 100 to 500 and 500 to 1,000 units. <br> Only written responses to this Sources Sought are requested.  The Government currently anticipates issuance of a follow-on Sources Sought with more refined requirements based upon feedback from this Sources Sought.  As part of the follow-on Sources Sought, a prototype of the proposed system may be requested to be available within 120 days for Government evaluation of available technology.  Further information on the requirements, evaluation plan, and schedule for the prototype evaluation system will be provided in the follow-on Sources Sought.  However, continuation of this effort past the initial Sources Sought is discretionary and the Government is under no obligation to issue a follow-on Sources Sought. <br>  Submissions of designs that are not fully compliant with all requirements are also encouraged so that PM-TAS and RDECOM-ARDEC may assess the capabilities of all currently available technologies. The Government recognizes that proprietary and/or classified data may be a part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted/proprietary and classified data and present them as an addendum to the nonrestricted/non-proprietary and unclassified information.  As a result of this Sources Sought a Request For Proposal (RFP) may be issued to develop a fully compliant system. A full specification will be released if and when there is follow on procurement activity. All interested sources are encouraged to submit their abilities/capabilities no later than 45 days from date of this publication to: Christina.a.makhijani.civ@mail.mil, 973-724-1490 and albert.a.rinaldi.civ@mail.mil, 973-724-3071; ACC-NJ-JA Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact, brochures/literature, etc., and any prior performance relating to this equipment. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Electronic submittals are preferred.  <br>

Since it is anticipated that multiple contract awards may be made, the Bureau of Reclamation anticipates that some firms may have experience in all the component types while others may have specialized experience in only some of the component types such as onsite machining, manufacture of bushings, etc.   It is beneficial to the Bureau of Reclamation to know the levels of capabilities in the commercial marketplace, as the evaluation to perform one specialty may outweigh the ability to perfom many.  
     3.  Provide a detailed description of the type of facilities where the work would be performed, including the size of facility, and the type and capabilities of the equipment to be used in the repair/remanufacture and manufacture of the components.  
     4.  Demonstrate the firm's ability to self perform machining work at the contractor's facility or onsite at Hoover Dam.   Include a list of machine capabilities.
Firms interested in submitting a capability package should be sure to address each item above fully in order to clearly demonstrate capabilities. Firms should demonstrate the capability to self perfom the work utilizing their own equipment and facilities.  No other information should be submitted with the capability package than as requested above. 
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Rita Horkan, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to:  rhorkan@usbr.gov.  The subject line of the e-mail must reference:  "Response to Sources Sought Notice - Turbine and Generator Hydroelectric Component Manufacturing and Rehabilitation IDIQ".  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities web site at https://www.fbo.gov/.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses and socio-economic categories of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code 541690, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of administering a Post-Doctoral Research Associateship (or similar) Program.</p>
<p>The establishment of a Post-doctoral Fellowship Program is specifically articulated in the Organic Act, Post-doctoral Fellowship Program (15 U.S.C. 278g-2), which states - the Institute shall establish and conduct a post-doctoral fellowship program, subject to the availability of appropriations, which shall be organized and carried out in substantially the same manner as the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Post-Doctoral Research Associateship Program that was in effect prior to 1986, and which shall include not less than twenty nor more than 120 new fellows per fiscal year. In evaluating applications for fellowships under this section, the Director shall give consideration to the goal of promoting the participation of underrepresented minorities in research areas supported by the Institute.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (DRAFT)</p>
<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The mission of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC)/ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. The research performed at the NIST research laboratories to support this mission is of vital interest to the United States and the larger global scientific community. The NIST Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program, in its authorization, provides two-year excepted term appointments for outstanding scientists and engineers chosen through a national competition. The program has more than fifty-five years of historic excellence in identifying and recruiting world-class postdoctoral scientists and engineers to work at NIST. NIST currently participates as part of the National Research Council (NRC) Research Associateship Program (RAP), which includes 28 federal agencies, with NIST as the first agency to participate in 1954. NIST is not only interested in recruiting outstanding new scientists and engineers through the postdoctoral program to contribute to its cutting edge research during postdoctoral appointments, but NIST is also interested in retaining a significant number of postdoctoral associates afterwards as employees of NIST's regular staff scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>In the NIST Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program, there are two important objectives that must be kept in proper balance for the exceptional conduct of the program. These objectives are: 1) to provide postdoctoral scientists and engineers of unusual promise and ability opportunities for research on problems, largely of their own choice, that are compatible with the research interests of the sponsoring NIST laboratory; and, 2) contribute to the general research effort to the NIST laboratory.</p>
<p>The NIST Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program, begun in 1954, is a Congressionally-mandated program accommodating up to 120 new postdoctoral fellows per year.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide overall administration services as outlined in this document for the successful conduct of a NIST-wide Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program for NIST. This shall include providing the necessary personnel, materials, equipment and facilities (except as otherwise specified) for services to support such a program throughout the NIST laboratories. The Contractor shall provide administrative support for NIST to be able to make research associate awards twice per year to scientists and engineers at the doctoral level in a national competition that undergoes a rigorous professional scientific review process of each application. This administrative support shall include recruitment of potential, qualified applicants, collection of application packages and rigorous scientific review of application packages to provide NIST sufficient information to make the postdoctoral research associate awards.</p>
<p>The awards made by NIST will provide opportunities to enable Research Associates to further increase their proficiency in research, and to make governmental laboratory facilities, often including unique equipment, available to the scientific community.</p>
<p>The contract will be offered for one base year and four (4) one-year option periods. The required tasks listed below shall be applicable for the base year, and also for each of the one-year option periods.</p>
<p>3. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>a. Develop, maintain, and update a database of NIST-submitted Research Opportunities and make these opportunities available to the research and academic communities at large through a web-based interface. Research Opportunities must be searchable via web-interface by potential applicants using NIST Research Adviser name and keywords. At a minimum, an annual call (nominally in the late spring) for review of research opportunities shall be organized by the Contractor via email, with notification to the COR, requesting all Research Advisers update their contact information, and edit/delete/add any pertinent research opportunities. The Contractor shall continue to offer the ability to all Research Advisers, and the COR, to modify the research opportunities via electronic means throughout the year.</p>
<p>b. Provide free and open application information via the internet and all necessary application forms (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP/PGA_047698) to the academic and research communities, with two discrete competition opportunities per year, for application deadlines of 1 February and 1 August of each year. For each competition, the Contractor shall provide the application forms available for download from a web-based interface in portable document format (pdf). Any modification to the use of the pdf format must be approved in advance by the COR. The Contractor shall provide access to all application materials to the COR and individually to the appropriate proposed NIST Research Adviser via a secure web interface. The Contractor shall receive, log, and develop a file for each application to include, in addition to the complete application form, a research proposal for the proposed postdoctoral work, university transcripts, a statement of previous and current research, and three confidential reference reports. In addition to these documents provided by the applicant, the Contractor shall include in the application package an evaluation by the requested NIST Advisor/Mentor, which confirms the interest of NIST in the proposed research. Any application missing such an evaluation, or returned with a negative evaluation shall not be sent by the Contractor to the review panel. The Contractor shall check each application file prior to review and notify each applicant of required documents that are missing. The Contractor shall screen all research scientists to eliminate anyone who does not meet the criteria of U.S. citizenship at time of application and limit those applications to those holding the Ph.D. degree less than five years at time of application.</p>
<p>c. Invite and appoint panelists for the competitive review of applications. These panelists shall be experts actively involved in scientific research. Panels shall be established in the broad disciplinary areas of Chemistry, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Engineering, Life Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics, and include those with expertise matching the subject matter of the submitted research proposals. To maintain the excellence of quality panels of renowned scientists and engineers, at a minimum the panelists must have held a Ph.D. in an appropriate panel discipline for at least 10 years, have a documented history of scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals and/or of chapters in books, oral or poster presentations at professional meetings, membership in and service to professional societies, and mentorship of scientific research. Distribution of panel reviewers per broad area will vary depending on the distribution of applications within the disciplines, but a general distribution would be Chemistry - 30; Earth and Atmospheric Sciences - 20; Physics - 35; Life Sciences - 35, and Engineering - 50. Sources of panelists include, but are not limited to, members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM); individuals recommended by NAS, NAE and IOM members and their sections liaisons; individuals recommended by other panelists; individuals identified through contacts at national meetings, and individuals identified by the Contractor based on specific discipline searches. The Contractor shall possess sufficient experience and knowledge to identify panelists with expertise matching the subject matter of the submitted proposals. Care should be taken to assure that there are no possible conflicts of interest when selecting panelists. Panelists should be chosen for an initial term of three years, with possible renewal upon satisfactory performance for an additional three years. Composition of individual panels should be assessed for balance in gender, age, race and ethnicity. Panel reviews should be conducted on-site at least once per year, during which time quality assurance is performed to ensure that all reviewers are familiar with review procedures and scoring of application packages.</p>
<p>d. Securely collect all information for application packages for distribution for the panel reviews in the appropriate research areas. Conduct expert panel reviews of application packages, occurring each March and September for the respective competition deadlines of February and August. A minimum of three expert reviews shall be conducted per application, with additional reviews conducted, if deemed necessary due to score spread of greater than 10% between reviewers. Any expenses associated with the conduct of the review panels are the responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>e. Provide a roster that ranks all applicants based on panel review to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), who will provide the Contractor with an affirmation or declination of interest to support proposed research efforts. After the Contractor's review panel has completed its evaluation process, the Contractor shall provide individual application scores to the COR. The COR will respond with these responses to the Contractor within 60 days of the date the roster is received by the COR. NIST is responsible for issuing offers and for all procedures relating to on-boarding of selected postdoctoral research associates.</p>
<p>f. After the NIST selection process has been completed, the Contractor shall work with the COR to record the offers, and offer results (acceptances and declinations) in a secure database to be set up and maintained by the Contractor; records in the database must include, but may not be limited to, information on all applicants, such as name, Ph.D. university, demographic and other information, such as a list of associates' lab/Center location, start and end dates, and advisor name. The access to the records is restricted to the Contractor, the NIST COR, and those NIST staff that the NIST COR approves to have access.</p>
<p>g. All tools employed by the Contractor, including applications, conduct of reviews and review outcomes and fiscal and technical reports shall be implemented electronically; i.e. use only paperless management tools/web-based systems. Reference to the existing research opportunity list, including keyword and advisor searches can be found at: http://nrc58.nas.edu/RAPLab10/Opportunity/Opportunities.aspx?LabCode=50 and reference for how to apply can be found at: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP/PGA_046398</p>
<p><br />h. Conduct annual staff visits to the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus and the NIST Boulder, CO campus. The visits shall be of one-day duration, and travel expenses are the responsibility of the Contractor. Coordination of the visits shall be made with the COR, who will assist in approval of visitor access to each campus for the visits. During the visits, the Contractor shall update the laboratory administration and NIST research advisors on program matters and receive feedback on how the program is functioning at the laboratory level. In addition, group interviews with associates working at NIST laboratories shall be conducted in order to gather information on the performance of NIST as a host research agency. Reports on the performance of NIST labs shall be provided to the COR, as part of the annual report. Subsequently, adjustment to program management shall be made as necessary by the Contractor to address the concerns of the laboratory administration or by the laboratory to address concern raised by the associates.</p>
<p>i. The Contractor shall work with the COR to extract information from end of tenure reports, which the COR will provide, to store in a database and provide summaries of data as requested. These will include, but are not limited to, number of scientific, peer-reviewed publications, information on subsequent employment, highlights of completed research during the associateships, and patents and inventions achieved by the Associates in the program. The reports shall be submitted on Contractor-provided forms, available for download on the program website. The standard form currently used by all participating Federal Government agencies can be found at http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP/PGA_053498</p>
<p>j. Promote the NIST program broadly to recruit the brightest and most talented scientists and engineers with recent doctoral degrees in disciplines of interest and compatibility to NIST to conduct research at NIST research laboratories. This includes a combination of information disseminated through print advertising, direct mailing, electronic mailing and internet postings using professional societies and employment sites. General plans for such dissemination should be detailed in the Contractor's proposal. Specific attention should be made by the Contractor for outreach to under-represented populations in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), including disseminating information through minority-focused meetings, recruitment at historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSI's), tribal colleges and universities, and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institutions (AANAPISI's). The Contractor shall respond to mail, telephone, e-mail, and personal inquiries and provide application details, forms and instructions, and additional information, as requested.</p>
<p>A list of the estimated number of Research Advisers, Research Opportunities, and Applicants is given below:</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background</p>
<p>EIM is a tetrapolar technique of noninvasively applying high-frequency low amplitude stimulation through the skin surface and measuring the resultant alteration in voltage responses produced by the underlying muscle. Unlike conventional electrodiagnostic techniques, the EIM results reflect characteristics of the structure and composition of the muscle rather than its specific electrophysiological characteristics, adding a different dimension to characterization of muscle in muscle or nerve diseases. EIM is a painless, quick and relatively simple procedure to perform. EIM has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of disease progression (Clinical Neurophysiology 2009). EIM has potential to accelerate the ability to complete Phase 2 clinical trials because of its sensitivity to follow muscle changes and correlate with survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (ALS 2012). EIM has also been used to evaluate longitudinal changes of muscle development in the spinal muscular atrophy compared to normal pediatric muscle development (Muscle &amp; Nerve 2012), as well as demonstrated changes in disuse atrophy (Arch PMR 2009). Recently, EIM is being evaluated longitudinally in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (NCT01523964).</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The Electromyography Section at NINDS seeks to provide innovative and reproducible methods for monitoring patients in neuromuscular clinical trials at NIH. A handheld measuring device is needed that can provide a systematic measurement of electrical impedance myography (EIM) in people with neuromuscular disease. This device is required to be able to measure muscle anisotropy in multifrequencies of EIM, and needs to be integrated into a software program that is readily applicable for clinical research.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the Electrical Impedance Myography measurement device should have the following functional specifications:</p>
<p>The ability to deliver multifrequency currents for measuring bioimpedance of muscles;</p>
<p>Software to measure and compute muscle anisotropy from multi-angle assessment of muscle impedance measurements;</p>
<p>Function with a standardized configuration of sensors that can analyze a focal muscle at different angles and frequencies to reproducibly measure muscle physiology; and</p>
<p>Interface for data acquisition by a laptop computer.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought</p>
<p>Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their response, a list of functional specifications for the supply/equipment that meets this proposed requirement and specifications listed above and demonstrate past performance in providing a device used for assessing neuromuscular disorders. The capability statements shall be limited to 10 pages and will be used to determine the ability of small businesses in the commercial marketplace capable of providing the supply/equipment as described in this notice.</p>
<p>Respondents' should include their DUNS number, organization name, address, technical and business point of contact including title(s), telephone and facsimile numbers, e-mail address, business size and type of business pursuant to the applicable NAICS code, 334510, Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing, with a Small Business size standard of 500 employees. Submissions in response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall be submitted no later than 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on March 1, 2013.</p>
<p>All information in response to this notice shall be sent electronically to the Contract Specialist contained in this notice, at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov, prior to the closing date of accepting responses. Electronic submissions should be contained as an attachment to the email as an Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office file.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important News: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>This is a sources-sought notice to solicit interest in manufacturing sources for the production of AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow MK 58 MOD 6 and MOD 7 rocket motors NSN 1337-01-506-2612 (MOD 6) and 1337-01-506-2614 (MOD 7) to fulfill Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and US Navy requirements . The results of this notice will be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Air-to-Air Missiles Program Office (PMA-259), intends to procure these motors on a full and open competitive basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(b). The MK 58 motor is 60.6 inches long and 8 inches in diameter. The grain is case bonded, consists of separate boost and sustain propellant, in a side-by-side configuration. The motor assembly consists of three major subassemblies; a case with propellant grain, a safe-arm-ignition assembly (MOD 6) or arm-fire device (MOD 7), and nozzle, and weather seal at the rear. Please note, MOD 6 igniters are not expected to be a part of this procurement, even if MOD 6 motors are procured. An integral part of the case are the attachment points which include the forward skirt, launch hooks, waveguide clips, antenna bracket, and fin dovetail slots. This procurement will include identification and qualification of a new propellant binder, since the binder (HC-434) used in the last production is no longer available.

<DESC>The Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides laboratory space and equipment to conduct research on overcoming challenges related to the interconnection of high penetrations of renewable energy systems into the electricity grid. NREL is offering the use of its unique capabilities within ESIF.
<p>Unique Capabilities <br />+ Hardware-in-the-Loop at Megawatt-Scale Power: Megawatt-scale power-in-the-loop allows utilities, researchers and manufacturers to conduct integration tests at full power and actual load levels in real-time simulations and evaluate component and system performance before real-world deployments.</p>
<p>+ High Performance Computing Data Center: Petascale computing at the High Performance Computing Data Center enables unprecedented large-scale modeling and simulation of material properties, processes, and fully integrated systems that would otherwise be too expensive, too dangerous, or even impossible to study by direct experimentation.</p>
<p>+ Uniquely Connected: Each lab in the ESIF has its own niche with different kinds of equipment and functionality fostering research on all aspects of energy integration. The Research Electrical Distribution Bus, the ultimate power integration circuit, is made up of two AC and two DC ring buses that connect multiple sources of energy and interconnect "plug-and-play" testing components in all the labs.</p>
<p>+ Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System: Integrated throughout the ESIF, a SCADA system monitors and controls the Research Electrical Distribution Bus operations and safety and gathers real-time, high-resolution data for collaboration and visualization.</p>
<p>+ Data Analysis and Visualization: Analysis and visualization capabilities at the ESIF go beyond what is found in a typical utility operations center. Fully integrated with hardware-in-the-loop at power capabilities, an electrical distribution bus, a SCADA system, and petascale computing, the ESIF allows researchers and NREL partners to visualize complex systems and operations in a completely virtual environment including utility system planning and operations.</p>
<p>While the focus of this partnering opportunity is for demonstrating cost-effective and reliable solar generation integration in real time, at utility-scale, in successful utility business models, these capabilities can be applied to the development and demonstration of a breadth of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. <br />Background</p>
<p>Utilities (Investor-owned, Federal utilities - such as power marketing associations, Municipals, and Cooperatives) have a growing need to become more familiar with the various issues that could arise under high penetrations of renewables (especially solar), test ways to handle these issues, and use these results to develop and incorporate specific processes and tools into the mainstream utility power system operations to handle high penetrations of renewables. NREL, through ESIF's advanced hardware testing and modeling capabilities, can help utilities assess the potential levels of penetrations and impacts of these penetrations at specific locations within a utility's service territory. Through the development and testing of realistic and spatially and temporally accurate renewable penetration scenarios, utilities can develop a clear plan and timetable for incorporating methodologies to operate the power system in real-time with high renewable penetration under various system conditions</p>
<p>Entities interested in utilizing NREL's capabilities or in partnering with NREL in response to relevant solicitations and Federal Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) should contact the point of contact provided below. For entities responding to solicitations/FOAs, NREL's services (including any required cost share) must be included in the applicant's proposals.</p>
<p>Point of Contact:<br />For more information please contact Dr. Martha Symko-Davies: Phone: 303-384-6528, Martha.Symko.Davies@nrel.gov; <br />ESIF Website: http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting Concept Papers from firms for battalion scale Waste to Energy Converter (WEC) systems for contingency base camps. This is not a Request for Proposal. The Government anticipates awarding multiple two-phase contracts, with competitive downselect after the first phase, under topic A.1 Combat Feeding Equipment Systems - Combat Food Service Equipment for Individual and Group Feeding, Sub-Topic h., of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13.<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>Deployed forces generate enormous amounts of solid waste, including 3-4 lbs per person each day from field feeding, that has typically been disposed by burning in open burn pits, burn boxes, or trucked to landfills. These methods consume fuel and have negative environmental and force protection consequences. Burning waste creates operational and maintenance burdens, operational security concerns, safety and health issues, is environmentally harmful, and wastes energy. Backhauling waste is expensive, places Warfighters in harm's way, and also consumes fuel. However, for any military camp, the majority of the solid waste steam is carbonaceous and therefore could be remediated onsite and/or converted into an energy source. Effective waste destruction is of higher priority than efficient energy conversion, as is minimal manpower, but exporting energy improves the return on investment and shortens the payback period. <br><br>Waste characterization varies significantly, but projections can be made from the data in the referenced documents. Because much of the waste is generated by foodservice operations, it can be expected to contain substantial moisture from prepared food and partially consumed beverages, and it is not practical to manually segregate these materials. Bags of trash are also likely to contain small metal cans (e.g., from beverages and single serving fruit cups) and some glass bottles. Manual segregation is highly undesirable and should be limited to bulk food slop and obvious metal items, such as bags of empty #10 cans.<br><br>Previous work has shown small air-blown gasifier and pyrolysis technologies to have good potential for small-scale waste to energy conversion, although this RFI is not restricted to those technologies. However, existing prototypes have been unable to meet contingency basing needs in terms of transportability, ability to reliably handle raw unsegregated field waste, and/or other performance requirements expressed below. These shortfalls in current technology represent opportunities for applied research to address the requirements described in this synopsis.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS<br><br>For the purposes of this synopsis, the desired system characteristics are described in the following preliminary performance requirements:<br><br>     1. Complete System. The WEC shall include all necessary equipment (e.g., pre-processing, material transport, power generation, pollution control, etc.) to ingest bagged waste and export electrical power. It shall be rugged and low-maintenance to minimize operational costs, and shall have few consumables to minimize logistical requirements. <br>     2. Throughput. The WEC shall process 2 tons waste per day to support a battalion-scale expeditionary camp.<br>     3. Waste Feedstock. The WEC shall process unsorted mixed non-hazardous solid waste from foodservice and other activities, with variable constituents and moisture content as described in the background section. It is also desirable to process other waste materials such as wood pallets and used motor oil. <br>     4. Transportability. The entire WEC system shall be packaged or containerized in 8 8 20-foot ISO shipping containers for rapid deployment and compatibility with existing transportation assets. The WEC shall be packaged in as few containers as possible (objective 3 containers or fewer including power generation). The system should be capable of achieving CSC certification and passing rail impact and rough terrain transportation tests. <br>     5. Manpower. The WEC shall have automated control and operation and shall require minimal manpower (objective 1 part time operator), including any waste handling or segregation.<br>     6. Residues and Emissions. The WEC shall produce only non-hazardous residuals (e.g., no solid, liquid, or gaseous byproducts that require special handling or disposal). Any residues or emissions shall be benign to the environment and safe for equipment operators.<br>     7. Smoke and Odors. Because it is intended for use in the camp near trash generation and/or electrical power demands, the WEC shall produce no smoke or objectionable odors during operation, including startup, shutdown, and unexpected power interruptions.<br>     8. Power Generation. The WEC shall include its own power generation capability. The use of standard military tactical quiet generators may be advantageous from a maintenance perspective, but is not required. <br>     9. Fuel. The WEC shall be able to use either JP-8 or DF-2, whichever is available, for any fuel requirements (e.g., startup, operation, or bi-fuel power generation).<br>     10. Efficiency. In terms of fuel and electric power, the WEC shall be self-sufficient, exporting at least as much energy as it consumes.<br>     11. Cost. The WEC target production cost is less than $1M.<br><br>INFORMATION OF INTEREST<br><br>The intent of this synopsis is to identify systems/technologies that have already been shown to meet many of the performance requirements listed above and can be developed into a mature technology demonstration prototype system within two years, ready for demonstration/validation and subsequent engineering and manufacturing development. The Concept Paper should include physical and functional descriptions of the proposed system, including:<br><br>     1. Performance Requirements. Discuss ability to meet the requirements specified above.<br>     2. Technology. Discuss technology used, including reactor design and subsystems, and assess Technology Readiness Level / maturity.<br>     3. Cost. Estimate research and development funding required and production pricing.<br>     4. Packaging. Discuss system size and weight when configured for transportation as well as setup procedures and operational configuration.<br>     5. Feedstock. Discuss acceptable and problematic feedstock and any manual segregation or separation requirements. Discuss how the system assures automatic, reliable, and uninterrupted processing of challenging feedstock (e.g., variable composition, high moisture content, and containing tramp materials).<br>     6. Throughput. Discuss waste processing rates, acceptable duty cycles, and turndown capability to accommodate feedstock availability or power demand.<br>     7. Power. Discuss generator (e.g., type, output, efficiency), system parasitic energy requirements, and net electrical output.<br>     8. Consumables. Discuss all system consumables, including fuel, water, and maintenance items.<br><br>It is anticipated that offerors may have already built and demonstrated systems similar to what is sought by this synopsis. The Concept Paper may include as an appendix or attachment, not subject to the 5-page limit, additional information about existing systems such as descriptions, diagrams, photographs, energy balance, test data, and environmental certifications that help substantiate performance claims and demonstrate technology maturity.<br><br>SUBMISSION PROCESS<br><br>All interested firms are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/nsrdecbaa.html. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-291-0389<br />Name:		Towel, Paper, Multi-Fold, Kraft, 9.2 x 9.4 inches<br />Description:	Multi-fold, unbleached, Kraft paper towel for use in bathroom dispensers has a 3 1/8" deep fold. The towels are 9.2 x 9.4 inches and contain environmentally preferred 90% post-consumer recovered materials (PCRM.) UOI is BX. BX = 16 Sleeves. Sleeves = 250 Towels. 4,000 Towels Total.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-291-0389<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MK530ESCA -22; 6202BW -22; MB550SCA -22; 8200PL -22; MB560SCA -22; 7871EG -22; 01890KIM -22; 4000-MFW-TCW; 700SNS -22; 20204GPT -22; 21100VIN -22</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 11, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes.
A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Friday March 1, 2013 by sending an e-mail to valarie_reinholz@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 1 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to: AVISTA Corp  DUNS: 007943764  NAICS:  221210 Natural Gas Distribution  AUTHORITY: 8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
Avista Utilities supplies all natural gas to the National Fish & Wildlife Forensics Laboratory. Simply put, this service is required to keep the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory supplied with building heat and hot water for both laboratory use and personal hygiene.  The National Fish & Wildlife Forensic Laboratory exists of approximately 40,000 sq. feet and is a crime lab, providing service to multiple law enforcement agencies that submit evidence for analysis. Since the lab opened in 1988, Avista Utilities has been the only vendor to supply natural gas. This service is not provided by any other vendor and to remove the lab from such services would render the lab without essential heating and create an unhealthy environment. The cost of heating the lab and hot water use for 12 months is approximately $50,000 per year depending on actual usage.
This purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via email only. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. Direct any questions regarding this announcement to Valarie Reinholz via email at valarie_reinholz@fws.gov

<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO for Thermal Shield Engineering Maintenance and Support, for a Base Period and Four 1-Year Option Periods, for the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The mission of the NIST Center for Neutron Research is to operate the NCNR safely as a cost-effective national resource; to conduct a broad program of research using neutron techniques, and to develop and apply new neutron measurement techniques; and to operate the NIST Center for Neutron Research as a national resource for researchers from industry, university and other government agencies.</p>
<p>NIST's Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is equipped with a Custom Built Thermal Shield. The Thermal Shield System provides the cooling for the Biological Shield. The flowing of cooling water in the Shield was replaced in 2012 from a positive pressure system to a negative pressure system. The system was designed, fabricated and installed by an outside engineering firm, Merrick &amp; Company. The introduction of the new highly specialized technology requires outside engineering skills. In addition, Merrick &amp; Company developed the software program that operates the equipment currently at NIST's NCNR.</p>
<p>Merrick &amp; Company is uniquely qualified to provide the necessary engineering services for the continual operation of the NCNR reactor's Thermal Shield. Their expertise and deeply-rooted experience with the running of the existing equipment, hardware and software, is essential to NCNR, to ensure there is very little downtime to the Thermal Shield, and their ability to analyze and correct problems in a timely manner will allow for a near continuous operation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 811219, with a size standard of 19 million dollars.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by March 11, 2013 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<SOLNBR>N0002413YYYYY
<CONTACT>
<DESC>On March 5th, 2013 from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Program Executive Office (PEO) Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) PMS 403, Remote Minehunting System (RMS) Program Office will conduct Display and Briefing Sessions for the Remote Multi Mission Vehicle (RMMV) at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock (NSWC) Divisions South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility (SFOMF), located on the south side of Port Everglades inlet at 91 North Beach Rd. Dania Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  PEO LCS PMS 403 Program Office will provide a programmatic and top level technical briefing March 5th starting at 0900 at the Port Everglades Port Authority Administration Bldg. at 1850 Eller Drive, Fort Lauderdale FL 33316, Conference Room #301.
  After the briefing, attendees will proceed to the NSWC SFOMF where an RMMV will be on display.  The RMMV will also be on display at NSWC SFOMF again on March 6th from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  The technical briefing will only be given on March 5th.  All interested industry partners are required to pre-register and only those persons on the attendees list will be admitted to the RMMV Display and Briefing Sessions. 

The sessions will be held at the UNCLASSIFIED level (U.S. citizens only). All interested members are required to provide names and company identification to rmmv_display_day@navy.mil no later than February 28th, 2013 at 1200. All attendance requests shall contain the full name of all people attending, Security Officer contact information to confirm US citizenship, and the CAGE Code of the company they represent.
 Interested industry partners are highly encouraged to have up to a maximum of three individuals present. In the event that a company submits more than three attendance requests, only the first three persons will be allowed to attend. 

The objective of the unclassified briefing is to provide a technical and programmatic RMMV overview. 

The RMS is a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water.  The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible RMMV carrying a towed variable depth sensor, the AN/AQS-20A.  The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated and maintained from the LCS.
  The AN/AQS-20A incorporates five separate sonar/sensors (side-look sonar, forward-look sonar, volume search sonar, gap fill sonar, and electro-optical identification sensor) in a compact, lightweight, and hydro-dynamically stable towed body.  The AN/AQS-20A localizes mine-like objects and provides the operator with a visual image and a contact data list.  All mission data is recorded by the LCS for post-mission analysis.  Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Over-the-Horizon (OTH) communication provides vehicle Command and Control (C2) and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission.  The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield.  Current intentions call for the RMS to be deployed from the LCS as part of the ships Mine Counter Measures (MCM) Mission Package (MP).

There will be no opportunities for questions or discussions between individual industry representatives and Government Technical Program Office representatives.

There will be no handout material provided at the event.
  This announcement may be updated with presentation material.  Please periodically recheck this announcement.

<p>&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p>d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p>1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 2) Favorable fingerprint results; 3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; b. Favorable fingerprint results; c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and d.<br />Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.<br />This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelvemonth period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p>a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p>b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p>c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p>d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p>3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>
<p>5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court re- view of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice un- der I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is<br />in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under<br />11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings.

<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROL: 	The incumbent will be expected to work independently with little direction and guidance.</p>
<p>I.	POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Despite a prolonged period of political crises from July 2011 to February 2012, Kosovo and its institutions have made progress. The Government of Kosovo (GoK) has adopted a strategic plan designed to promote long-term economic growth; the basic framework legislation for functional rule of law institutions exists; new Kosovo Serb-majority municipalities are functioning; and Kosovo's relationships with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) are steadily progressing. However, transparency and accountability are major obstacles to better economic performance in Kosovo. The slow pace of inter-ethnic reconciliation also threatens to impede Kosovo's development. USAID programs stimulate economic growth by supporting the private sector, fiscal institutions and the energy sector, foster good governance, rule of law and democracy, and support basic education and employment for Kosovo's youth population. USAID's confidence-building programs address underlying causes of conflict and promote inter-ethnic harmony.</p>
<p>Kosovo has the youngest population in Europe, with 50% under the age of 25, and 19.1% considered youth (15-24).   Approximately 35% of young people leave school early (10% of those before they reach secondary school).   Of those who finish secondary school, 10% to 20% go on to university.  The rest look for gainful employment.  With unemployment rates ranging from 50% to 75%  for youth between the ages of 15 and 24, and the likelihood of employment significantly lower for those who do not finish secondary school, the majority of young people, at some point, enter the ranks of the unemployed. Moreover, according to World Bank estimates, it takes approximately 10 years for young people to transition from school to full-time, permanent work.</p>
<p>The growing youth population that is unemployed, disengaged, and disconnected is emerging as an urgent issue of central importance for the newly independent Kosovo state.  Their disengagement presents the most immediate risk to stability.  Youth are frustrated by an educational system that does not prepare them for the workforce, hiring practices perceived as heavily reliant on nepotism, political leaders who provide no vision, and a lack of outlets for social and civic engagement.  The combination of a youth bulge with slow economic growth, weak governance, poor education, and a history of conflict contribute to a situation where negative forces, such as extremist religious groups or nationalistic political movements, can manipulate youth to create instability in the region.</p>
<p>The serious issues faced by youth in Kosovo are inextricably linked to the systemic failures of Kosovo's education sector.  A USAID assessment in June 2009 found that the education sector is plagued by poor governance, politicization of leadership positions, a weak management structure that does not promote professionalism, lack of quality assurance and teacher evaluation and licensing mechanisms, poor curriculum development, and a dire lack of learning materials that would develop practical skills, such as textbooks focused on applied learning, laboratory and physical equipment. The assessment noted wide disparities in per-student funding across municipalities, leading to questions about equitable access to education.  There are also considerable and increasing differences in drop-out rates among girls and boys, and for students from ethnic minorities or with disabilities.  Constructive engagement with the education sector will be critical for addressing some of the root causes of youth disengagement.</p>
<p>The USAID/Kosovo strategic plan for 2010-2014 has a Youth Assistance Objective (AO) of "Youth are more productive and engaged members of a stable Kosovo". USAID/Kosovo is currently completing a new five year strategy. It is anticipated that one Development Objective of this strategy will focus on education - both higher and basic education including institutional capacity building - and that youth will continue to be a cross-cutting theme. <br />The current youth and education portfolio consists of two awards: on-going $9.7 million basic education project that is jointly funded and managed with the Government of Kosovo through its contribution of an additional &euro;5 million; and a $6.3 million young entrepreneur's project which will end in September 2013. USAID Kosovo is currently designing a new higher-education program tentatively named the Transformational Leadership Program with $15 million in USG foreign assistance funds and a Government of Kosovo commitment for an additional &euro;10 million.</p>
<p>USAID/Kosovo is a medium-sized Mission with 109 staff positions (17 U.S. Direct Hires [USDHs]), 8 U.S. Personal Services Contractors [USPSCs], and 84 Foreign Service Nationals [FSNs]) working in six offices:  Program and Project; Economic Growth; Democracy and Governance; Financial Management; Executive; Regional Contracting; and Director's Offices. The Mission manages an active portfolio valued at $206 million implemented through 37 partner organizations. FY 12-13 OYB was $48.5 Million plus seven million euros (approximately $10 million) of GoK and other donor funds.</p>
<p>The candidate selected under this statement of work will lead the Youth and Education Team within the Economic Growth Office (EGO) of USAID/Kosovo in Pristina, Kosovo.  Travel within Kosovo will be routinely required.  The Advisor will report directly to the EGO Director and directly supervise two professional FSNs who comprise the Youth and Education Team.</p>

GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)<br /><br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br /><br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee. <br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br /><br />8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment.

<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br /><br />10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br /><br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension; <br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(ii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br /><br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br /><br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br /><br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br /><br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br /><br />(1) completed supplies, and <br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br /><br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br /><br />11.

<p>15.

If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date.

<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br /><br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred. <br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included: <br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and <br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

The Government will not consider any offer that does not include all of the antennas found in a particular class. The TEP will be determined based on the prices proposed for all the antennas in a particular class. The Government will award to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s), in response to the solicitation, provides the Government the lowest evaluated price, and meets the acceptability standards on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Price:</p>
<p>The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness to ensure pricing has been submitted for all items in a particular class of antenna (Platform, Deployable, or Lightweight).

The Government will determine a Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for each Schedule proposed class of antenna based upon known Government requirements for the five-year ordering period. The TEP will be calculated per antenna class by multiplying the Government provided "TEP Evaluated QTY" by the Offeror's proposed antenna price. The sum of all calculated prices for each CLIN will determine the TEP per antenna class.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical:</p>
<p>Each Technical sub-factor will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable. If any sub-factor is rated - "unacceptable," the entire proposal will be rated technically unacceptable, and the proposal will be excluded from award consideration.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: Technical Capability - Technical Capability - The Government will rate the Offeror's technical capability as "acceptable" if the Offeror provides documented evidence of meeting all the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Work and Antenna Performance Characteristics (per class of antennas).</p>
<p>Sub-factor 2: Delivery Schedule - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's delivery schedule proposed for each CLIN. The Government will rate the Offeror's delivery schedule as "acceptable" if at least the first 25 antennas of each CLIN proposed will be delivered within 90 days ARO.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Jermond.m.williamson@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

</a>
<DESC>GSA 1500 East Bannister Road Kansas City, MO 64131 is issuing a posting notification to Solicitation Number QSDM-J4-138945-I. This posting is hereby issued to clarify the offer due date on Solicitation Number QSDM-J4-138945-I. The combined synopsis/solicitation form on the Fed Biz Opps.Gov (FBO) website erroneously states that the offer due date is February 22, 2013 at Noon Eastern Time. The offer due date specified in block 8 on the Standard Form 1449 dated Wednesday, February 27, 2013 at Noon Eastern Time is correct. 

The previous procurement history found on page I titled cover page is erroneously stated for NSN 5130-00-889-9011. This posting corrects the information as follows:  

Previous provider of NSN 5130-00-889-9011 is CD, Inc D/b/a: Tool Warehouse, at a price of $68.75 each.

Sincerely,

The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT #1: This amendment is to 1) provide responses to vendor inquiries and 2) extend the electronic response submittal due date through Wednesday, February 27, 2013 at 3:00 p.m.<br /></strong><br />*************************************<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM-2013-659/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to assist in obtaining social media and engagement tool software to evaluate on-line resources of the NLM by mining social media. This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210-Software Publishers.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and makes its stored information available online at no charge to consumers, health professionals, and biomedical scientists through a diverse suite of resources. Evaluating how its databases and other resources are utilized is an important component of continuing quality improvement and has long been an on-going program of NLM management through a potpourri of monitoring tools. The world-wide explosion in the use of social media provides a unique opportunity for sampling sentiment and use patterns of NLM's "customers" and for comparing NLM to other sources of health-related information.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to obtain software capable of examining such social media sites as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites with inquiries relevant to NLM issues and with full respect for privacy rights of those who created the social media entries.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The work requirement will demonstrate an approach to comprehensive access to the target information within a framework that permits NLM to rapidly formulate and process complex queries relevant to evaluation of its programs and those of its "competitors."</p>
<p>Project 1: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Consumers</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and effects of various health-related announcements and events on usage patterns including:<br />&bull; Relative frequency with which various NLM resources are mentioned<br />&bull; Comparison of NLM mentions with mentions of "competitors"<br />&bull; Identification of urgent information requests for which NLM could "push" vetted information free of advertising or commercial interest<br />&bull; Effects of topical health issues such as "mad cow" or West Nile Virus or disasters etc. on use of NLM resources<br />&bull; Effect of changing NLM's interface design and textual/graphic style on usage by consumers<br />&bull; Effectiveness of NLM use of social media to distribute health information<br />&bull; Comparable analyses of other NIH, DHHS and private sector health information sources<br />&bull; Demographic characteristics of those whose messages are being examined to the extent permitted by privacy regulations.<br />&bull; Ascertaining public interest in using social media for health-related purpose<br />&bull; Value of tweets and other messages as teaching tools and change-agents for health-relevant behavior</p>
<p>Project 2: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Health Professionals and Biomedical Scientists</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and reactions to information provided to clinicians involved in patient care, and scientists focused on research issues, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM bibliometric databases<br />&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM full-text references<br />&bull; Information-seeking behavior of clinicians and scientists<br />&bull; Effects on usage of modifying database design features<br />&bull; Professional comments about value of NLM's resources <br />&bull; Comparison of use of NLM resources to use of those provided by "competitors"<br />&bull; Regional and international differences in information-seeking behavior by professionals</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility:</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, and equipment, not other&not;wise provided by the Government, to provide the requisite services required to support this requirement which is directly related to the work of the NLM. All work shall be monitored and technically co&not;ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks/Services:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following specific tasks for Projects 1 and 2 in accordance with the respective project descriptions identified above:</p>
<p>Task 1: Install appropriate software on a Government computer(s) that is designed for efficient customer-friendly operation and has option of extending capabilities</p>
<p>Task 2: Maintain a comprehensive "universe" of social media data subject to queries. Content from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites will be maintained by the Contractor and kept up-to-date in a timely manner and made available for query by Government</p>
<p>Task 3: Provide an appropriate library of relevant search terms appropriate for the questions of interest to NLM. Software must accommodate complex query combinations, and permit ad hoc creation of new query terms and combinations in accord with NLM quotidian interests.</p>
<p>Task 4: Train designated Government personnel in proper use of the licensed software and in efficient formulation of queries</p>
<p>Task 5: Provide on-going consultation as needed to refine queries of importance to Government.</p>
<p>Task 6: Offer improvements to the software as developed from time to time by Contractor</p>
<p>Number of Users:</p>
<p>The Government expects license to cover two (2) users.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>&#9679; Evaluating On-line Resources of the National Library of Medicine by Mining Social Media: The final product will be an installed software package that meets the requirements of the Government for timely retrieval from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites from the social media information stores maintained and kept current by the Contractor</p>
<p>&#9679; Expert assistance as needed from the Contractor to assist the Government in formulating inquiries with search terms and term combinations that will provide appropriate responses appropriate for the goal of Government questions relevant to the NLM mission</p>
<p>&#9679; Training of at least two (2) Government staff members by Contractor personnel and through on-line resources <br /><br />&#9679; Display of search results in an efficient manner, preferably in dashboard form, suitable for analysis by the Government.<br /><br />&#9679; Periodic updates on status/changes in the social media environment</p>

<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among price and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>
<p>A. Technical Merit (50 Points). Understanding of the objectives of this statement of work, and quality and clarity of approach to accomplish the objectives. Evidence that social information resources available are appropriate for the objectives and kept up-to-date. Evidence of ability to accomplish the specific tasks described with methodology that enables NLM to formulate complex queries that can be processed quickly and be displayed in a form suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>B. Personnel Merit (25 Points). Qualifications, experience, and availability for project must be demonstrated in proposal. A resume should be included that documents previous pertinent experience and references in harvesting organization of social media, and in giving users the ability to formulate efficient queries appropriate for the intent of the questions under consideration. Personnel involved in training aspects of the work should be identified.</p>
<p>C. Organizational Capability, Experience, and Commitment (25 Points). Evidence of organization capability to complete projects, install designated software, and provide on-going support to NLM to facilitate its query formulations and related tasks. Does the offerer demonstrate understanding of the NLM mission, and of the themes of interest for which social media will be mined? Has the offerer had previous experience in analysis of social media data in the health and disaster fields? Is there evidence of appropriate training assets in place?</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: COMMANDANT (CG-9131) U S COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS 2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>AHRQ has established a web-based repository of information about patient registries, the Registry of Patient Registries (RoPR) (https://patientregistry.ahrq.gov ). The current RoPR works together with clinicaltrials.gov so that the initial registration and basic data elements are registered in clinicaltrials.gov and additional data elements specifically related to registries are collected by the AHRQ system. Many registries and studies using a registry design had already registered in clinicaltrials.gov at the time of development of the AHRQ RoPR, although much of the data pertinent and specific to registries was not collected.</p>
<p>As registries have gained increasing importance for comparative effectiveness research and quality improvement and quality reporting initiatives AHRQ has also undertaken several initiatives to help the developers and users of registries maximize the value of their data and efforts. These initiatives include:</p>
<p>1. The AHRQ Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes: A User's Guide (http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&amp;mp=1&amp;productID=531)<br />2. A design document for an Outcomes Measures Framework to help encourage and facilitate the use of common data elements and definitions in similar conditions (http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&amp;productid=1223)<br />3. A white paper listing options for developing a web based forum for patient registries (http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/489/1310/Web-basedForumRegistries_DraftReport_20121106.pdf)</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The objective of this potential requirement is to continue to facilitate and and advance the use of registries and registry research. Specifically, the objectives are to: <br />1. Provide maintenance of the RoPR system and promote the registration of patient registries in RoPR as well as technical assistance to users of the RoPR system<br />2. Implement and further develop the Outcome Measures Framework for use in the RoPR system<br />3. Update the AHRQ registries handbook (Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes User's Guide) and develop the 4th edition, including a series of white papers on outstanding issues that might be incorporated as new chapters. <br />4. Develop a web based interactive version of the Registry for Evaluating Patient User's Guide together with a web based forum for discussion of issues related to the methodology of registries to assist users of the RoPR.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements<br /></strong>There are four (4) major tasks for this project, each having specific requirements and deliverables:</p>
<p>Task 1: Maintenance of the RoPR system, technical support and promotion of registration: Migration of the system must be completed within 2 months of the start of the contract. All HHS and AHRQ requirements for security and privacy must be met (http://www.ahrq.gov/news/pubcomguide/pcguide2.htm#sites ). Ongoing maintenance of the system includes data backup and having the capability of answering 20 inquiries per month for technical assistance within one business day of receiving the request.</p>
<p>Task 2: Outcome Measures Framework: A data model will be developed to be used with the design document for the outcome measures framework and the framework will be implemented in RoPR. The specific tasks include reviewing literature on other data models used to standardize language for outcome measures including in electronic health records and clinical trial data systems, analyzing the application of these data models to the actual outcomes submitted in the RoPR system, and implementing the outcome measures framework in RoPR.</p>
<p>Task 3: Update Registries Handbook: Five white papers on emerging areas in registry development and use, including issues in privacy, ethics, data standards, and data analysis, will be developed in each of the first four years of the contract, and in the final year, the white papers will be incorporated into an updated version of the AHRQ registries handbook.</p>
<p>Task 4: Implement the web based forum for registry users: A governing board shall be established and operational guidelines will be developed on such issues as identification vs. anonymity of users and the web based forum will be implemented using an off the shelf technology platform.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is Nov 1, 2013 - October 31, 2014 with four (4), one (1) year option periods, from November 1, 2014 - October 31, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement/Information Sought<br /></strong>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 10 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

How was your past performance rating on work done in similar scope and magnitude to the work described in the draft PWS?   <br>     <br>  4.	Do you have a current approved DCAA Cost and Accounting System?   <br>    <br>  5.     Does your company have interest as a prime or subcontractor?  <br>     <br>  6.     What elements of the PWS would your company subcontract rather than perform with your own reseurces?  <br>     <br>  The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact. The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting specialist sabrinna.r.cosom.civ@mail.mil. The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. All requests for further information must be made in writing via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.   <br>    <br>  Questions and Answers  <br>    <br>  1.

The small business needs to be appraised at CMMI Level 3 and show how they plan on getting us to level 4. <br>  <br> 8. Would it satisy the Government's requirment if the small business (holding CMMI ML 2or 3) teamed with a partner that held the CMMI ML 4? Again, at least level 3 is required, not level 4. However, they need to show how they would get us to level 4. Level 2 is not acceptable. <br>  <br>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments, along with the specifications, plans and drawings, will be available at</p>
</span><a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 01/03/13. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. <br /><br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span>

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice Questions and Answers: 

Q1: Can you tell me if these services are currently (or previously) being performed by a contractor? If so, could you please provide the Incumbent name as well as the contract number? If this is a new requirement, is there an estimated dollar value, or NTE value associated with this requirement?
A1: The incumbent contract for the mechanical requirements is BAE Systems Land & Armaments under contract N00024-11-C-5301. The incumbent for the electronic requirements /final module assembly and test is Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors under contract N00024-11-C-5302.

Q2: I am interested in submitting a quote for the MK 41 Vertical Launching Systems.
 I would like to know, however, whether I should send a NDA for all of the personnel in my shop prior to getting the TDP; or if you would rather me send NDAs for only the personnel that would actually have access to the information for the bidding process and then, if awarded the contract, send NDAs for the remaining personnel.
A2:  Any and all personnel who will access the TDP shall submit an NDA. If additional personnel will require access to the TDP only in the event a contract is awarded, then the contractor shall submit NDAs for those individuals as appropriate at the time of award, prior to those individuals accessing the TDP.    

Q3: On 7 August 2012, the Government had conducted an MK41 VLS Launcher Production Industry Day to increase industry understanding and appreciation of MK 41 VLS Launcher design, Fleet utilization, safety features and production requirements and to provide industry the opportunity to ask questions and obtain feedback from the Navy.
  With the recent changes to the FY13-17 planned procurements, does the government intend to conduct another industry day to further brief the industry on these upcoming production requirements?
A3: At this time, the Government does not intend to conduct an industry day for N00024-13-R-5332.

Q4: In response to questions received from the previous MK41 VLS Launcher Production Industry Day, the Government had indicated that, At this time, the Government's intent is to limit participation of each subcontractor to no more than 20% of the overall effort based on the contract's total dollar value. The latest pre-solicitation Number: N0002413R5332 does not indicate the Governments intention to limit participation of each subcontractor as indicated above.
 Will the formal solicitation include a limitation percentage as previously indicated?
A4: Under N00024-13-R-5332, the Government does not intend to limit subcontracting; however, the final solicitation will set forth the Navy's requirement. The previous synopsis and industry day for MK 41 VLS under N00024-12-R-5320 has been cancelled and is no longer applicable or valid.

Q5: If/when a formal solicitation is released, what length of time does the Government expect to allow for submission of a proposal? It is expected that a competitive proposal of this magnitude should warrant 60 to 90 days allowance.
A5: The solicitation will govern proposal submission time. The Government intends to allow approximately 75 days for proposal submission from the date of RFP release.

Q6: The Government NDA indicates that, The MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) Technical Data Package (TDP) for Reference (a) will not be provided until each individual contractor employee requiring access to the TDP signs and certifies compliance with the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). It is expected that this proposal will require approval from upper-management officials prior to submission of offer.
 This may include reference material to the Governments MK41 VLS Technical Data Package (TDP). If this is the case, will the Government accept additional NDAs after 27 February 2013 for witness of the proposal/offer?
A6: The Government will accept NDA requests after 27 February 2013.

Q7: Do I have to have special access to get to Attachments N0002413R5332 N00024-13-R-5332  FY13, I am unable to open.
A7: No special access is needed.  Attachments are publicly available on FedBizOpps.  Attachments will open when clicked on.

Q8: When will I receive a countersigned NDA?
A8: The Government will not return countersigned NDAs to the potential offeror.

Q9: When can we expect access to the Technical Data Package?
A9: The TDP will be provided to the potential offeror after all the required documentation is received, and approved, by the Navy.
  In accordance with the synopsis, potential offerors interested in receiving the export controlled technical data will be required to submit a copy of a valid DD Form 2345 (Military Critical Technical Data Agreement) in addition to the NDA forms.   After all required documentation is approved, the Navy will begin the process to provide the TDP.  At this time, the Contracting Officer will inform the offeror, via email, that its NDA(s) and DD Form 2345 have been approved and that TDP will be provided.  It is anticipated that the TDP will reach the offeror approximately 3 business days after the approval of all required documentation.

Q10: What is the government's preferred method of accepting this information from the offeror (i.e.
 electronically, hard copy, etc?)  If hard copy is preferred, please specify if copied originals are acceptable.
A10: In accordance with the synopsis, information should be submitted via email to Mr. David Lubrano, Contracting Officer, at david.lubrano@navy.mil and Mr. Edgar Lee, Contract Specialist, at edgar.lee@navy.mil.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Headquarters<br /><br />2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) authorizes and approves the award of a firm fixed price (FFP) contract action to Rolls Royce Corporation (RRC), Indianapolis, Indiana covering Fiscal Year (FY) 13 requirements for Contractor Field Service (CFS) representatives supporting Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) deployed contingency operations for the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft AE1107C engine. .</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the issuance of a FFP contract for AE1107C CFS representatives. Efforts will include assistance to the Government in the identification and implementation of the engine maintenance necessary to meet at least full Organizational-level capability for aircraft based and/or deployed OCONUS. Specific duties of the CFS representatives will include technical assistance, training, engineering and/or maintenance effort or support. The CFS representatives will possess specialized knowledge, experience, and skills and have access to information covering the installation, operation, modification, and maintenance of AE1107C engines and components to support all levels of maintenance. The estimated dollar value for the procurement is $xxx($K) and will be funded as set forth in Appendix A Table - Estimated Dollar Value ($K).</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>RRC, as the original equipment manufacturer (formerly Allison Engines), was selected in 1993 on a sole source basis to integrate the T406 engine to the V-22 aircraft under contract N00019-93-C-0052. The T406 engine was designated as the baseline for the commercial variant AE1107C in 1996. The Government subsequently determined that the AE1107C met the definition of a commercial item resulting in FAR Part 12 awards for production and spare engines under contracts N00019-95-C-0209, N00019-07-C-0060, N00019-10-C-0020, and N00019-12-C-0007. As such, RRC is the designer, developer, and sole producer of the commercial AE1107C production and spare engines utilized in a common configuration in both the MV-22 and CV-22 aircraft variants. RRC commercial equivalent engines (AE2100 and AE3007) are based on the AE1107C (T406-AD-400) baseline and are utilized in other aviation platforms including commercial turbo-prop airliners (Embraer ERJ-1351140/145, Cessna Citation, SAAB 2000) and military aircraft (C-27J, C-130J, P-3, US-2, RQ-4). As the sole designer and developer, RRC is the only source possessing in-depth knowledge of the AE1107C engine requirements that can combine the technology, manufacturing engineering expertise, and technical data for this commercial product. There is no other alternate source to provide the engine support for V-22 aircraft at the present time. Further, as the AE1107C is a commercial engine, the Government does not have rights in the technical data necessary to perform the efforts authorized under this J&amp;A. Consequently, RRC is the only contractor that can meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>Market research and/or a survey was not conducted for the reasons set forth in paragraph (5) above. Pursuant to FAR 5.201, a synopsis was posted on 07 September 2012 for informational and subcontracting opportunities only. One response has been received to date. The responding company was evaluated and was determined unable to perform the necessary tasks needed based on the company's primary focus of being an outsourcing point with concentration in market research, administrative and procurement of tasks and projects. It was further determined that the responding company does not possess the technical expertise to perform the necessary services. Any future responses received by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this procurement action will be coordinated with the prime contractor and the NAVAIR Small Business Office to maximize competition for subcontract opportunities.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.402(a), the Contracting Officer must ensure that all supplies and support are procured at a fair and reasonable price. Analysis of the proposal will be performed by technical analysts and contract specialists, with the assistance of Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) analysts and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) as needed. The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) will analyze the various cost elements that are presented in the proposal, as well as review the actual costs from previous procurements. The PCO will use Government expertise, including DCMA, DCAA, the PMA and other Government resources, to evaluate the proposal's material, labor, and subcontract positions if needed. A detailed report developed as part of the Government evaluation will be utilized to establish a NAVAIR position. The PCO will utilize cost and price analysis as the basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price for the supplies/support covered by this J&amp;A.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth in paragraph 5 and 6, NAVAIR has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of supplies/support covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVAIR will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.<br /><br />Appendix A</p>

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($3K to $150K)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: 
Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 20, 1495 Wilmington Drive, STE 360, Dupont, Washington  98327

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed:  
This procurement is for janitorial services provided by DAMARC Quality Inspection.  This requirement comes from the office of Outreach where in accordance with acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR 6.302-2 IAW VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
PR#663-13-1-8891-0003.  The requirement is to provide janitorial services at the Tacoma VET Center beginning 24 Feb 13 through 23 August 2013.  These services are a vital part in caring for our veterans by maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene and preventing the spread of disease.  The total amount of this acquisition is estimated at $7,999.76.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:  
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1. The specific reason for restricting competition is an unusual and compelling urgency for a short term contract. The current contract was awarded using DAMARC's GSA schedule.  DAMARC has since had an audit review from GSA which found that since the scope of work on this contract is not listed under DAMARC's SIN that this should not be listed under their GSA schedule and should be considered as open market.  Therefore, we cannot process any option periods or extensions off of this contract and must put a new purchase order in place to continue needed services.  Furthermore, the Tacoma Vet Center will be relocating within the next six months to a leased space which includes janitorial services as part of the lease.  Based on these circumstances, re-competing this requirement at this time from a fiscal, workload and a training standpoint is not feasible.  

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
DAMARC Quality Inspection is currently providing these services and has trained personnel and resources familiar with VA systems.  These personnel have completed the VA background processing and have been performing services at the VET Center.  
DAMARC Quality Inspection has agreed to a short term contract for the Tacoma VET Center.  


6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:  
Under normal circumstances this procurement would fall under usual requirements for open-market competition and be open to bidding by any and all eligible contractors.  However, the urgent and compelling nature of the order (described in sections 4 and 5 above) precludes procurement for this short term requirement from any source other than the incumbent.  .

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
Price reasonableness will be based on market research, a comparison with similar pricing in related industry, and a comparison to pricing of the current contract, which was awarded after competition.  Under the current Purchase Order Number VA663-C21792 the monthly cost of services is $1,054.16 which will not change under this temporary contract.      

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
A limited amount of market research was conducted, due to the urgency of the requirement.  A search for other potential suppliers was limited to the current contract.  The results of market research indicated the service is commercially available to meet the Government's need; however the urgent need to ensure the uninterrupted continuation of services causes a need to procure from the known incumbent for a short term contract.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
No other facts to report.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
FedBizOpps Posting:  The requirement will not be synopsized in accordance with 5.202(a)(2), in that this acquisition is being conducted under unusual and compelling urgency and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203, however, this justification will be posted as applicable.

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
The proposed contract is for 6 (six) months.  The Tacoma Vet Center is scheduled to move to a leased space in which janitorial services are provided within the lease; therefore, there is no plan to re-compete these services.  

12.	 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c):
I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
