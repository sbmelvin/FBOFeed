<CONTACT>Rafael  A. Aviles, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2805, Fax 770-488-2688, Email raviles@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The following represents the questions and corresponding answers posed during the period for comments and questions as well as the pre-solicitation meeting held on November 13, 2008.
<p>The original notice was publicized in the Federal Business Opportunities website on October 10, 2008, under the title TBTC-Presolicitation. It is anticipated that a subsequent announcement will be publicized in January 2009, announcing the release of the solicitation for this requirement. Any interested party wishing to be included in the distribution of the solicitation must contact the Contracting Officer via e-mail at raviles@cdc.gov, and provide contact information. All requests for a copy of the solicitation must be received in writing and must be received by the Contracting Officer no later then 30 days prior to the closing date of the solicitation. The closing date of the solicitation has not yet been determined but is anticipated to be in April 2009. The announcement to be publicized in January 2009 will clearly specify the closing date..</p>
<p>Any party that participated in the pre-solicitation conference and/or requested to be included in the conference but could not participate will be included in the distribution of the solicitation and is not required to request a copy from the Contracting Officer as stated previously in this notice.</p>
<p>TBTC Recompetition 2009<br />Pre-Solicitation Meeting Q&amp;A's -- 13 November 2008</p>
<p>1 The technical evaluation panel must have a larger number of persons. You currently propose a small number of persons for a large number of proposals. Will this change?</p>
<p>The TEP will have sufficient members to assure that each proposal will receive full and robust primary and secondary reviews.</p>
<p>2 The 2nd meeting of the TEP will re-evaluate the revised proposals. Negotiation can affect the content. How will these be evaluated?</p>
<p>Using the same criteria and procedures as the initial review, albeit the process will be briefer since only those in the competitive range will be considered. The evaluation of revised proposals may be conducted by conference call.</p>
<p>3 Can the Project Officer serve on the TEP?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>4 Does the 50 page limit allow for appendices? What is the limit if a proposal contains multiple sites? Will you allow extra pages for additional sites?</p>
<p>The revised RFP will specify a lower limit. It will likely allow a maximum of 25 pages rather than 50, exclusive of appendices. If a site proposes additional clinical sites to satisfy the enrollment requirement, the proposal will likely be allowed an additional 5 pages to describe each additional clinical site.</p>
<p>For example, site A, whose requirement is to recruit 100 patients a year, proposes to recruit 50 patients in each of 2 separate clinical sites in city X. Site A is 1 consortium site, not 2 sites. This PI will be allowed a total of 30 pages (25 +5) if both clinical sites are included in the 1 proposal.</p>
<p><br />5 Will the slides from the presolicitation conference be available on the internet?</p>
<p>Yes, after clearance has been arranged.</p>
<p>6 What if a proposal includes a domestic and an international site, and only one appears strong? How can proposals allow acceptance of only some of the proposed sites? (i.e. how to "perforate")</p>
<p>This may be done in multiple ways. <br />--A site may submit two separate proposals (one with and one without a subcontracted 2nd site, for example). <br />--A site may submit separate proposals for two clinical sites (one involving a subcontracted international site and one involving a domestic site). <br />--Each clinical site may submit a separate proposal - the same PI would be the directly contracted site PI in a domestic proposal, and could be a subcontracted consultant in a proposal from a qualified international site.</p>
<p>7 PI's must increasingly demonstrate funding for percent effort. Proposers need guidance on what to propose. What is the minimum acceptable percent effort for PIs?</p>
<p>It is expected that sites will assure adequate supervisory and scientific engagement from PIs. This is necessary both to assure participation in the scientific activities of the TBTC, and to assure the efficient and proper conduct of clinical and follow-up activities at the site. In most instances, this can be expected to involve 10% or more effort from PIs. At some sites, the PI may not wish to commit this extent or may be unable to do so, because of other grant support; in that case, there should be adequate engagement from other appropriately experienced staff to meet this requirement. Some sites may choose to commit greater engagement from the PI. For selected positions (i.e., chair of Steering Committee and chair of Core Science Group), additional time will be required; this will be separately funded through contract modifications as needed.</p>
<p>8 Will the technical proposal be evaluated before the financial proposal?</p>
<p>Evaluation of the two proposals occurs concurrently. The TEP evaluates the technical proposal and may comment on the budget. At the same time, the Procurement and Grants Office evaluates the financial proposal.</p>
<p>9 What will be the composition of the Technical Evaluation Panel?</p>
<p>The panel will be constituted in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. The program intends to assure the presence of both internal and external evaluators, with expertise in the design and conduct of clinical trials generally, and TB trials in particular, including trials in the international setting.</p>
<p>10 What is the page allowance if one proposes multiple sites? Does this vary by number of sites?<br />See question #4 above.</p>
<p>11 What is the PI role if the clinical site is subcontracted? What is the role if the proposal includes multiple subcontracts?</p>
<p>As the principal author of the offer, the PI remains responsible for fulfillment of the contract terms. It is up to the offeror to specify the roles and relationships of the contract and subcontract staff.</p>
<p>12 May one site submit multiple proposals?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>13 What guidance can you provide concerning indirect costs to propose?</p>
<p>Offerors should use the most applicable indirect cost rate which is consistent with U. S. federal contracting law and institutional policy. Within these parameters, offerors are encouraged to utilize the most advantageous indirect cost rate. Each budget proposal will be evaluated based in part upon its overall total cost to the government, with all cost elements included.</p>
<p>14 Is it CDC's intent to continue support for the Community Research <br />Advisory Group (CRAG)? Should funding for CRAG members be included in each proposal?</p>
<p>CDC intends to continue support for CRAG, but through mechanisms distinct and separate from this RFP. However, site proposals are encouraged to include mechanisms for community engagement.</p>
<p>15 Should use of the CDC Central IRB be prioritized for domestic sites?</p>
<p>Yes; this will be considered in the evaluation criteria, since it promises increased efficiency in protocol preparation.</p>
<p>16 What are instructions for estimation of travel budgets? Instructions are needed so sites can know what travel to budget, for what locations, etc.</p>
<p>Budgets should include travel funds to allow attendance for 3 days by 1-4 persons from each site at the semiannual TBTC meetings (i.e., twice a year). The budgets proposed should include travel funds as deemed necessary by the offeror; it is the offeror's decision regarding how many persons to send to each meeting. To standardize budgets, proposers should assume that one meeting will be held in Atlanta. The other meeting will alternate between Chicago IL and Brussels BELGIUM.</p>
<p>17 Is it desired that proposals include the potential to perform studies of diagnostics? Will this capacity for diagnostics studies be given consideration in evaluation of proposals?</p>
<p>Potential for diagnostics studies should be noted briefly if present, and will be considered under evaluation criterion #5. Also see answer to question #26 below.</p>
<p>18 How will the potential for scientific contribution be evaluated?</p>
<p>Through such standard measures as prior performance in similar research consortia, consultations, peer-reviewed publications, etc.</p>
<p>19 In considering the group's scientific agenda, what capacities should be included - ability to do PK, phase 2, phase 3, LTBI studies? What populations are desired, and should their availability be flagged? On what type of study should the detailed cost proposal be focused?</p>
<p>All these capacities are desirable, but each offeror is not expected to have all of them. Those which are present should be described, as requested in the call for proposals.</p>
<p>The populations of interest are described in the RFP, in the appropriate sections.</p>
<p>The detailed cost proposals should be based on a phase 3 study with 6 months of active treatment and 2 years of follow-up after treatment. A detailed example of a phase 3 study for use in preparation of budgets will be included in the call for proposals. Enrollment will thus be occurring simultaneous with follow-up of earlier studies.</p>
<p>20 What consideration will be given in evaluation for the capacity to mentor young professionals? Will this be specified in the RFP?</p>
<p>Consideration of this capacity will be included as part of the evaluation element #4 Scientific Contribution Potential.</p>
<p>21 Is the basis for estimation of incidence at sites the WHO estimate of incidence of smear positive TB?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>22 How specifically will the number of sites be counted?</p>
<p>The total unit needed to satisfy the enrollment requirement (of 10, 30 or 100 patients per year) will be counted as 1 TBTC site.</p>
<p>If a PI proposes both a domestic and a subcontracted international site, will this represent 1 site or 2 sites?</p>
<p>Two (2) TBTC sites. If the PI submits 2 separate proposals, then each proposal would be allowed 25 pages. Separate proposals might be desirable if the technical approach, organization and details of process will be very different at the 2 sites.</p>
<p>23 The Core Science Group has suggested establishment of a repository for specimens. Will the RFP specify what types of specimens are to be collected, stored and shipped?</p>
<p>Sites should plan to collect, store and ship isolates from enrolled and relapsed/failed patients, sera from enrolled patients, sera or plasma from PK patients, and buffy coats from PK patients.</p>
<p>24 Will it be possible to shift funds from one category to another within the awarded site budget, if the TBTC requirements change?</p>
<p>Yes, if and only if approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>25 How should diagnostics capacity be addressed in the proposals?</p>
<p>The capacity of the site for conducting diagnostic studies should be highlighted in the same manner as other special capacities (for example, access to MDR-TB populations, access to children, or ability to perform pharmacokinetic studies; see question #17 above)</p>
<p>26 How should the laboratory staff and microbiologist be included in the site staff and as part of the TBTC team? Is there a standard structure for this? Does this imply some engagement other than the standard use of the site lab for cultures and smears?</p>
<p>There is no standard for how to include the laboratory staff and microbiologists in the TBTC team. The quality and quantity of the involvement is up to the offeror and contingent on local conditions. However, it is desirable to name specific laboratory personnel, the percent effort, and the costs to be charged to the contract to support, for example, special laboratory tests, completion of study case report forms, or travel by these (lab) staff to TBTC meetings.</p>
<p>27 Can you include examples of laboratory report forms in the RFP, so that site lab microbiologists can understand well what is required?</p>
<p>Yes, these will be added as appendices to the RFP</p>
<p><br />28 Can the RFP specify a minimum level of support for the site PI?</p>
<p>See question #7 above</p>
<p>29 Is there overlap among any of the evaluation criteria? If so, will this be corrected?</p>
<p>We are aware of some areas of duplication, as a result of the editing process. We will review and revise the document to eliminate any such overlap.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement to produce a more environmentally friendly oxidizer forsolid rocket boosters. The oxidizer is called ammonium dinitramide (A.D.N.). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from The Swedish Defence Research Agency (calledFOI for Forskningsinstitut) to produce a more environmentally friendly oxidizer for solidrocket boosters.   The oxidizer is called ammonium dinitramide (A.D.N.).  The U.S.A. had terminated their research in this area in the late 1990s due to thebudget reductions from the work funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of ScientificResearch (AFOSR).   The oxidizer, A.D.N., was found to have some sensitivity totemperatures that made its density low with poor packing of the oxidizer particles.    The research proposed by the F.O.I. has begun to overcome these issues with temperaturesensitivity and oxidizer density.Currently, the F.O.I. is the only organization that has the capability of performing thisresearch.   Their organization has significantly invested in this oxidizer developmentand garnered world-renowned propellant experts from several nations to complete theircurrent internal research goals and developments.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 16, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

A CPFF Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with a total period of performance not to exceed five years is contemplated for award on a sole source basis Northrop Grumman Corp. Navigation Systems Division (NG-NSD), formerly Litton Systems, for engineering and technical support of the Fiber Optic Conformal Acoustic Velocity Sensor, Wide Aperture Array (FOCAVES-WAA) submarine sonar.  The total estimated level of effort is 30,000 hours.  This action is sole source by the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Litton Systems developed the initial FOCAVES-WAA in response to a BAA under contract N66604-01-C-0550.  It was further awarded contract N66604-05-C-0437 to continue development and expansion of the system’s capabilities.  Timely and cost effective completion of this tasking is highly dependent on reuse of the previous and present FOCAVES designs/hardware. Litton Systems, now NG-NSD, is the sole developer and manufacturer of the FOCAVES-WAA system and, as such, they are the only source with the unique production and design infrastructure, capability, and specific knowledge to perform the tasks required under this contract.  SEE NOTE 22.
Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811213   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquistion Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider Avaya INC, for continued maintenance on EPA's NationalDecontamination Team's (NDT) satellite broadband service in the Mobile Communication Center (MCC). It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source based on the fact that down time and additional costs would be incurred by EPA in terms of replacement of equipment, training personnel for new equipment,  etc if a new vendor were to be chosen.  Market research has also shown that other companies offer service-only options but charge additional fees for service if their equipment is not used.  This would not be cost effective to the government.  EPA's NDT is requesting satellite broadband service in the MCC for the next twelve (12) months.  This service is necessary to maintain the MCC as a Type II FEMA MCC.  The MCC currently has the same equipment and broadband service to maintain its specialized and redundant voice communication system.  There are six (6) objectives to this maintenance agreement: (1)  Dedicated band width at least ten days per month;  (2)  VOIP port configuration;  (3) Twelve-month nation-wide shared plan with unlimited calls within the United States; (4) Service to four lines in the MCC;  (5) Data dedicated service with a minimum of 768 kbps up to Mbps and (6) Maintain continuity of current system operation and be compatible with the F-3 Datastorm satellite dish.       The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 811213 the period of performance for this award is not to exceed twelve months.  EPA has only one know source for this procurement that is in the Government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Agency, c/o Mr. Micole Cheatham at cheatham.micole@epa.gov by 12/08/2008 4pm.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334210   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider, NEC Unified Solutions, Inc. for a continuedmaintenance and repair service agreement for the NEC IPX PBX system located at ERT-WEST, Las Vegas, Nevada.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334210.  It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source based on the fact that this vendor is the only vendor capable of fulfilling this requirement with response times, providing qualified technicians and obtaining parts.  Through market research it was determined that due to the age of the equipment, the one-hour response time requirement and the cost of the parts if obtained through a third party, responsible competition was null.  This also would not be cost effective for the government.  The period of performance for this award is not to exceed 12 months from the date of award.  The EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the government's best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Protection Agency, c/o Elaine Scott at scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 2pm, EST December 9, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a SSA to identify potential sources that can provide the required flexible printed circuit assembly that is used in the Stabilator Amplifier.  The Stabilator Amplifier is used in the Armys UH-60A/L Black Hawk Helicopters.  The flexible printed circuit assembly is frequently replaced at Army depots when repairing the Stabilator Amplifier.  5998-01-124-5428 and 5998-01-533-2451 can be used interchangeably.  Any sources interested in the proposed action must be able to demonstrate that they can provide a flexible printed circuit assembly that operates with the Stabilator Amplifier. Additionally, Airworthiness Release (AWR) is required before equipment can be used on Army aircraft. AWR involves environmental, electromagnetic interference, and flight testing.  The Government possesses a Technical Data Package (TDP) for the most recently produced flexible circuit assembly, 5998-01-533-2451, that details the circuit layout and schematic, however, this TDP lacks detailed information on the composition and process instructions used with the polyimide compound associated with this item. Those composition and process instructions are proprietary to Cirexx International.  The Government plans to award a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to meet its requirements for this item and the annual quantity of items to be acquired is approximately 500 units.  This will potentially be the final acquisition of this item since it is planned that the Dual Stabilator Controller will replace the Stabilator Amplifier, in which case repairs of Stabilator Amplifiers will no longer be required.  Interested sources must provide information to verify that their items have obtained the required AWR from the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, or details of when an AWR is anticipated to be received. Additionally, provide information on your production lead time, as well as the status of your production line. If you do not have an operational production line provide information on how long it would take to establish an operational production line.  Sources capable of providing the required item are required to provide their written input to the U.S. Army CECOM LCMC, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AA, Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.<BR><BR>This SSA does not obligate the Government to award a contract. No telephone responses will be accepted, only responses in writing will be considered. This information can be emailed to the Governments points of contact as follows: Man Moy at Man.Moy@us.army.mil and Daniel Cordasco at Daniel.Cordasco@us.army.mil.  This SSA is for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals. The deadline for response to this notice is 26 December 2008.  <BR><BR>EMAIL:  Man.Moy@us.army.mil or Daniel.Cordasco@us.army.mil <BR>

This contractor provides very specialized testing required for correct determination of clinical diagnosis treatment of lymphoma from specimens taken on Fridays and weekends.  Testing is performed on biopsies to detect very short-lived abnormal cells.  Testing must be completed while the cells are still live or the lymphoma cells cannot be identified.  Historically, the VA has utilized non-local contractors which comprised the tested cells through transit.  The lymphoma cells did not survive through transit.  These karyotypes are vital to correct diagnosis of malignancies.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy this requirement.  This notice of intent is not for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, any laboratory that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within six (6) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NHLBI’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible and qualified small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Based on the responses received from this Sources Sought Notice, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.

The NHLBI Proteomics Center contractors will integrate expertise in multiple disciplines (proteomics, physiologists, clinicians, molecular biologist, genomics, chemistry, physics, engineering, computational biology, bioinformatics, and biostatistics) to advance proteomic applications in heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  NHLBI Proteomic Center contractors will address a specific clinical need/problem/disease/ process using three approaches:  1) proteomic technology development; 2) mechanistic and functional understanding of the proteome, its interactions and dynamics and 3) clinical application of proteomic approaches and discoveries.  The Proteomic Center interactive team will work on addressing a common physiological/pathophysiological need/problem/disease.  The components should be interdependent and drive each other’s science and progress.  

Specifically, Proteomic Centers will be expected to enhance proteomic tools and technologies with the goal of using them for mechanistic and functional understanding of HLBS diseases and disorders.  Enhancement of proteomic tools and technologies can include hardware or software to improve the measurement, characterization, or comparison of proteins, peptides, PTMs, isoforms, genomic/epigenomic tags, small molecules, or other related cellular or tissue components.  Mechanistic and functional understanding can include, but is not limited to, experimental and/or computational approaches to molecular function/dysfunction, dynamics, interactions, pathways, process, transport, or other related actions, in cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. The Centers should also work with an eye toward clinical studies using the proteomic tools, technologies, mechanisms, and functional understanding to guide human subject studies.  It is expected that all Centers will have human research studies during the course of the project period.  The Centers should leverage existing resources to support these human subject studies, such as CTSA, Clinical Networks, ongoing Clinical Trials, ongoing Cohort studies, and industry supported studies.  

The NHLBI Proteomic Centers will be proposals at the cutting edge of science.  Thus, it is important that the funded Centers interact to share information on technical objectives, progress and impediments, as well as exchange ideas, and, where appropriate, establish collaborations.  All research products and results must be made available to the research community in a timely fashion.  Each Center must have a project plan that addresses milestones, deliverables, and sharing; including software, technology, biological data, and resources.

The NHLBI Proteomic Center Investigators must have documented training, experience, expertise, and availability to implement the goals of this program.  The organizational and administrative structure, and the adequacy of the facilities and resources necessary to meet the objective of the proposed Proteomics Center (including institutional commitment to the Center), must be demonstrated.

Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 10 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the Sources Sought Notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern’s name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

<DESC>Please note that this is NOT a request for SF330's or proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue a Request for Proposal. The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care Center, Biloxi, MS, is conducting a market survey for qualified small businesses that are Veteran-owned (VOSB) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) located within a 250 mile radius of the VAGCVHCS located at 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, MS.  If there are enough responses of interest to this notice the Request for Proposal will be issued as a 100% set-aside for SDVOSB or VOSB.  Look for any further information in FedBizOpps.  Applicable NAICS code is 541310 size standard $4.5 million. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax is acceptable) and received no later than December 12th, 2008. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES will be accepted. All responses to this notice must indentify the social economic category of the respondent, name and address of company, name and phone number of contact person, and must also include the company's DUNS number.  Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square foor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.  A/E shall submit one (1) set of Mylar sepia "as-builts" (each drawing shall be stamped "AS-BUILT" in red ink), and shall submit computer generated material depicting as-built conditions in accordance with all applicable VA Engineering CADD requirements.  A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCad 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.

<DESC><p><strong>Industry Day announcement for a Subminiature Flight Safety System</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>Subject</strong></p>
<p>The notice is to inform interested parties of an Industry Day for the Subminiature Flight Safety System (SFSS) Project to be held on 28-29 January 2009 at Eglin AFB, FL. The purpose of this event is to both provide and gather information to ensure the success of the future acquisition of SFSS.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br />The 308th Armament Systems Wing and the 46th Test Wing are seeking technology and acquisition strategy input to refine the direction of the SFSS Project. This initiative falls under the direction of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, Test Package Directive # 05-F-5-55-0502.</p>
<p><br />Department of Defense ranges require redundant flight termination systems on all munitions whose flight profiles may exceed the range boundaries or cause a hazard to the general public. Weapon system position from launch to impact, the health of each flight termination system (FTS), and the ability to send the termination signals to the weapon are all required by the range safety officer. This necessitates a time-space-position information source, a telemetry (TM) system, and redundant FTS components. The goal of the SFSS project is to develop a common, cost effective, subminiature, non-intrusive package that meets all the Major Range and Test Facility Base and Range Commanders Council safety requirements.</p>
<p><br />The plenary session of the Industry Day will be conducted from 0800 - 1000 CST on 28 January 2009 University of Florida Research Engineering &amp; Education Facility (REEF), Shalimar, FL. One-on-one discussions for prime weapons contractors and potential prime SFSS contractors, in a proprietary only forum, with Government personnel will be scheduled following the group session. The length of time allotted for each contractor will be two (2) hours. Your desire to have a one-on-one session must be submitted by 9 January 2009 via email correspondence to SFSS Industry Day at 46tw.ts.investmentsteamtsit@eglin.af.mil. Discussions will be scheduled in the order the requests are received and you will receive an email notification of the date and time.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Proposed Contract Action - Extension of Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) Risk Reduction & System Definition (RR&SD) Contracts (FA8808-04-C-0022 and 0023)

<DESC><p>The Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) Space Segment program office intends to issue two sole source UCAs (Undefinitized Contractual Action) for the extension of the Risk Reduction &amp; System Definition (RR&amp;SD) contracts FA8808-04-C-0022 and FA8808-04-C-0023 for six months from 7 Jan 2009 to 7 Jul 2009. The TSAT Space Segment program office anticipates award of the contract extensions in early Jan 2009. The planned contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).
<p>The current TSAT RR&amp;SD contractors are Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), Sunnyvale, CA. and Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc. (BSS), El Segundo, CA. It is anticipated that this effort will be awarded to LMSSC and BSS as a sole source award.</p>
<p>The reason for a 6 month-extension of the two contracts is to synchronize the RR&amp;SD phase ending date with the schedule for the award of the Development &amp; Production (D&amp;P) phase. During the contract extension period, the contractors will execute Block 10 system definition and risk reduction work which the Government will use to evaluate/update Block 10 requirements prior to releasing an updated D&amp;P Request for Proposal. This extension will also provide continuity for the program teams during the extended source selection timeline which will be extended beyond the expiration of the current TSAT RR&amp;SD contract. The estimated value for each contract extension is $75M.</p>
<p>The contractors shall develop TSAT system definition and design concepts, assist in requirements definition, conduct prudent Block 10 related risk reduction and present the results in the form on an Interim Design Review (IDR). The contractors will ensure that all critical technologies necessary for Block 10 are maintained at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 until the execution of the D&amp;P phase of the contract. The contractors will continue to engage with the TMOS and SE&amp;I contractors to ensure further development of the overall program is not stalled and the Space Segment stays in-step with the corresponding network (TMOS) and system engineering (SE&amp;I) segments.</p>

4.7 Security Requirements

4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract.  Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval.  If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's total loss of access approval for grand jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

4.7.1.2 The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract.  This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants.

4.7.1.3 Should grand jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17.  In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies. 

4.7.1.4  In the event the USAOs is unable to obtain security approval to grand jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for grand jury court reporters.

4.7.2	Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder.  The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:
 

•	Policy development or implementation

•	Higher-level management assignment

•	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

•	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

•	IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

•	Assistance to policy development and implementation,

•	Mid-level management assignments,

•	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

•	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

•	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3	Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.
 
The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subject’s background during the past 5 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

	Low Risk Positions.  The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of 	Investigation Name and Fingerprint check.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted 	following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below.  The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

	Title and Number of Form			No. of Copies

	FD-258 Fingerprint Card				   2
	SF 85P - Questionnaire For				   2
Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractor’s Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individual’s immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individual’s behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

	(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

	(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

	(d) The individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

	(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
     changes.

	(g) The motivation for the conduct.

	(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

	(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel.  In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3	Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.  Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.  The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement.  The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

 
	
4.7.4	Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:
o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material.

The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval.

1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.  A Contractor may be eliminated based on its prices, in comparison to other Contractor’s prices.  The Government may also eliminate a Contractor based on Contractors past performance history and failure to provide documentation necessary to verify the acceptability of their court reporters.  A Contractor shall provide the additional information listed below:  

1.2.1	Qualifications of Proposed Staff – The Government reserves the right to request at any time the professional qualifications of Contractor personnel.  This information will be used to ascertain the depth of relevant requisite training, skills and professional certification of personnel.  

1.2.2	Past Performance – Provide (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The following information is required for each reference:

o	Customer name and address.
o	Point of contact (name, title, telephone number, and fax number) for contractual/administrative matters (e.g., Contracting Officer) and technical performance (e.g., Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative).
o	Contract/Task Order number.
o	Total dollar value of the contract/order.  If performed as part of a team, provide the dollar value of your firm’s contribution.
o	Period of contract performance.
o	Description of work performed.	

1.2.3	Recording Method – The Contractor must clearly identify the contractor’s type of 			recording method and/or equipment that will be used for both grand jury and 			depositions.  Failure to provide this information could affect the contractor’s 			ability to receive a contract award. 

E.2 Evaluation Criteria

DOJ may award up to two (2) awards as a result of this solicitation.  

E.2.1 Evaluation criteria:
The Government will evaluate prospective contractors past performance and price in making an award decision.

3.1.1	Past Performance -- Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a Contractor, as an organization, has satisfied its customers.  The EOUSA will           check each contractor’s client references to inquire about (1) the quality and timeliness of the vendor’s work; (2) reasonableness of its business behavior; and, (3) technical and management capabilities.  The EOUSA will attempt to check the references provided by the contractor, particularly commensurate tasks, and may expand the evaluation to include references not contained in the vendor’s submission.  The actual number of references checked is entirely at the EOUSA’s discretion.

3.1.2   Price - The Government intends to make BPA/contract award(s) to the offerors whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The evaluation of price will be based on the Government estimate of quantities and the offeror’s total price.  If the Government determines that there are significant differences in technical merit among competing proposals, then a more expensive proposal may be selected for award where the Government determines that the value of the selected proposal is worth the price differential.

Each vendor’s price proposal will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of proposed prices. This evaluation will be based on the information and supporting data provided in the proposal and its compatibility with the evaluation factors identified above. 

In making this determination, the Government is more concern with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than overall price.

ATTACHMENTS 

D.1 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement.  The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.  Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States.  Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.



D. 3 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National 
         Emergency 


Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

•	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

•	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

•	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

•	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

•	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

•	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

•	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

•	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

•	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


•	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

•	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to:

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

_______________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month 
VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):

1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour
would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for
that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures at FAR Part 13 are being used.  Any resultant contract will be Firm Fixed Price, one award. Offeror must hold prices firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-27.  The acquisition will be processed as full and open competition.  The associated NAICS code is 112519 – Other Aquaculture. 

 The U.S. EPA, Region 5, Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO), 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago IL has a requirement for a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).  The ROV will be used as a sampling and data gathering tool in support of the GLNPO mission.  The ROV will be used to investigate many of the underwater habitat features discovered during use of towed side scan sonar.  These habitat surveys will be mainly in the nearshore areas at the best operating depth of the ROV.  While the side scan sonar gives GLNPO the ability to find and map large habitat features, a visual inspection performed with the camera and lights of the ROV will be essential to determining smaller habitat characteristics.

The ROV will be used to sample the benthos (small plants and animals living on the lake bottom).  This will include video censusing of larger areas of the bottom than are feasible to explore with sediment samplers operated from the ship.  Another use of the ROV will be in ship maintenance  The ROV will be used for routine inspections of the ship’s hull to ensure its integrity and to investigate the extent of fouling (attached animals/plants) of the hull: this leads to bringing invasive species from one lake to another on the hull.  The ROV will also be put into service in case of problems with the Research Vessel Lake Guardian below the waterline, including problems with the propellers, rudder, sea chest intake, bow thruster, etc.

The ROV is required to be two-person-deployable and weigh no more than 90 - 100 lbs. in air.  In order to be used on small boats and operated by  two individuals, the ROV’s body dimensions must be no more than 765mm long, 560mm wide, and 460mm high.  The ROV will be operated in a diverse set of depths and environments and therefore must be able to function to a maximum working depth of at least 150-meters.  For site investigations, habitat structure documentation and benthic biological community documentation purposes the ROV is required to have two video cameras.  The first video camera is required to be color with at least 570 lines of horizontal resolution and a Lux level of at least 0.3.  The color video camera must have a tilt range of 180 degrees and have at least a 270 degrees range of view.  The color camera is required to have a 50 watt (min.) quartz halogen light with variable intensity that is capable of tracking the camera.  The second video camera is required to be black and white with at least 430 lines of horizontal resolution and a Lux level of approximately 0.03 for low light site investigations.  The video output for both cameras must be NTSC.  The vendor is required to provide an integrated control console that operates on a maximum of 650-800 watts with video monitor in a waterproof case.  The control console must also incorporate an integrated hand controller with joystick that controls the ROV’s forward, reverse, rotate, and lateral movements as well as additional controls for vertical thrusters, thruster gain, trim, auto heading, auto depth, camera tilt, camera focus, lights on/off, light intensity, video overlay, and accessories.  The vendor is required to supply an ROV with brushless thrusters.  Each brushless thruster must have a thrust of no less than 0.30 horsepower each, and the ROV must be capable of a forward momentum of at least 3 knots to operate in strong currents.  The vendor is also required to supply one spare brushless thruster.  The vendor must supply an external lighting system to be mounted on the ROV to provide light when in poor visibility environments.  In order to operate the vehicle in strong current and to avoid an undue amount of in-water drag the vendor is required to provide a 150-meter umbilical with a diameter of no more than 13mm.  The umbilical is required to be neutrally weighted in fresh water.  The vendor is required to provide an umbilical reel for the 150-meter umbilical cable.  The umbilical reel must be fitted with a slip ring housed in a weatherproof housing.  

The vendor must also provide a scanning sonar and software for long range image capture and low visibility image capture to locate targets, range to object and object avoidance, as well as for navigation.  The scanning sonar must have a minimum range of 80 meters and a 360 degree field of view.  The vendor must provide software with the following features: 

a. Scan sector setup 
b. Scan speed
c. Zoom
d. Recording of image 
e. Image measurement

Minimum requirements are:

Based in USAID/Kyiv, the Deputy Director of the Office of Economic Growth (OEG) will help oversee the design, implementation, and coordination of USAID-financed activities in the OEG portfolio.  

Under the general administrative and policy guidance of USAID Director of the Office of Economic Growth, the Deputy Director will help to manage the office’s affairs and its portfolio of programs in Ukraine and Moldova. OEG is responsible for design and implementation of a wide range of activities. The $97 million OEG portfolio includes: development of the financial services sector with emphasis on capital markets through fiscal and pension reform and access to credit; improving the business investment climate through commercial legislative and regulatory reform; local economic development through municipal strengthening; harmonization of trade policies with the European Union; agriculture reform and development; and modernization of energy and other communal services. 

OEG staff consists of 4 US Direct Hires (A Director, Deputy Director, Private Enterprise Development Officer, and a Junior Officer), 1 part-time USPSC, and 11 FSNs. 


GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

a. Develops strategies to achieve defined short and long-term results to promote the development of market economies and economic growth in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. These programs are developed and implemented in consultation with mission senior staff, including the USAID Regional Mission Director and Deputy Director, and where appropriate, the Country Director for USAID/Moldova and his staff,  E&E staff, Department of State EUR/ACE staff, and others involved in USG programming in the EG sector in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.  The Deputy Director will undertake preparation and presentation of economic policy papers to senior mission management in the fields of trade, competitiveness, and food and energy security in conjunction with implementing partners.  

b. Provides guidance to staff on coordinating and directing assistance by USAID-supported grantees and contractors carrying economic development activities in Ukraine. The position will provide leadership to CTOs in developing sustainable indigenous NGOs that can take on leading roles in pursuing economic reforms in the fields of business regulation and policy in key sectors. This will include ensuring that supported NGOs can seamlessly mesh with USAID and other donors, and are capable of raising resources to sustain their activities in the future.  The Deputy Director provides oversight of large and complex regional projects involving U.S. institutional contractors, grantees, and other types of implementing partners in economic development.

c. Serves as a liaison on economic issues with relevant policy and technical level host country counterparts and advises the senior mission management in Ukraine on matters pertaining to policy, administration, and implementation of economic growth activities. Provides host country government counterparts timely advice and assistance on economic policy matters.

d. Provides regular and frequent reporting to the Regional Mission Director/Ukraine and Deputy Mission Director, Director of OEG, E&E Bureau on progress, impact, problems, constraints, opportunities and issues related to USAID financed economic growth programs in the regional mission.

e. Represents USAID at senior levels and coordinates with other donors and multilateral agencies in Ukraine in the area of economic growth. Conducts analyses and makes recommendations on policy, technical and administrative issues that form the basis of U.S. positions to be advanced by the U.S. Government in its discussions with the World Bank, the IMF, UNDP, the European Union, the European Commission, the G7, and a host of bilateral donors regarding Ukraine’s and Moldova’s economic development. The Deputy Director ensures that USAID policies and programs complement other donor efforts and multilateral institutions and, where necessary, adjusts or revises USAID economic development programs to avoid duplication. The Deputy Director ensures that USAID regional mission senior management and economic development staff are informed about other donor and multilateral policies and programs throughout the region that might affect Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus.

f. Participates in the mission's programming process in determining assistance requirements and phasing of assistance. The incumbent will provide strategic inputs to key program documents and coordinates closely with the mission’s Program Office. S/he will provide strategic leadership in the development of the mission's overall economic growth strategy by leading in the development of analytical and strategic documents and will coordinate Economic Growth Office's goals and objectives with the Program Office and mission strategy.

g. Ensures prompt and efficient implementation of programs and, in conjunction with the Program Office, regularly evaluates results. Reorients or restructures programs and projects to ensure achievement of objectives and mission sector policies and goals. Leads and provides guidance to project design teams and CTOs to help them achieve program objectives within the context of the approved mission strategy.

h. As requested by the Financial Management Office, supervises preparation of input to audit responses and ensures that appropriate follow-up action is taken on audit recommendations.

i. Oversees the development of the OEG project-funded budget, working with technical advisors and senior management to determine funding needs and uses; provides close supervision of mortgages, pipelines, and funding requirements; and, manages the OEG procurement planning and implementation, supervising technical advisors and support staff to ensure that all office procurement actions are properly identified, scheduled, developed, and implemented; 

j. Ensures that OEG reporting, documentation, and written communications are responsive, reasoned, accurate, and prompt.


SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP: The Deputy Director, under the general administrative direction of the Director of the Office of Economic Growth, will directly manage a component of the OEG portfolio and supervise FSN staff as part of his/her responsibilities. It is expected that as USDH staff are gradually brought on board, the OEG Deputy Director will shift his/her responsibilities to that of a team leader, focusing less on strategy and management of the office to technical program management of one or several areas of the EG portfolio. 

LEVEL OF CONTACTS:  The Deputy Director will have daily or weekly contacts with contractor and grantee chiefs of party, USAID senior staff and U.S. Embassy section heads. S/he will negotiate assistance programs with other donor representatives and GOU officials at senior technical levels.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The applicant that represents the best value to the Government will be considered for award of FETP Resident Advisor PSC. To determine best value, the following factors will be considered:</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">1. The extent an applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications based on information obtained through the application package and interviews. Note that interviews may or may not be conducted; therefore, the application package should clearly identify how well the applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications of this position. Interviews, if conducted, may be either in-person or via telephone.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">2. Information collected from reference checks. References will only be verified for those applicants determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Results of a cost assessment. The cost assessment will determine the total cost (salary plus benefits and allowances) of the applicant for the complete term of the contract (base period plus any option years).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Basis for Award</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">In determining best value, paramount consideration shall be given to technical merit (applicant qualifications and reference checks) rather than to cost. In cases where applicants are determined to be essentially equal, then cost may become the determining factor.</span></p>

<DESC>The following are offeror generated questions.  Response is below the question.

1.       Line 004 - The Current Version of QuickTest Professional is 9.5, the RFQ on FedBizOpps states 8.2.  Could you please confirm which version they are looking for?   

8.2

2.       Line 001, 006 They are receiving a Quality Center server which includes a 5 pack license of users + 22 more concurrent users.  Do they want 27 licenses or 22 licenses?   

22

3.  Previously "Add ins" had to be purchased separately with QTP.  However under new Licensing arrangements, Functional Testing Software provides QTP along with all its add-ins for free.    Item Numbers 02, 03, 04 and 05 will have to be revisited, because of this licensing arrangement.   

This is a software maintenance renewal.  We are not purchasing new software.  We plan on using the versions listed and upgrade sometime in the future.  

4. The current version of Quality Center/QTP is 9.5 (with version 10 expected Jan 2009)  Hence version 8.2 of QTP will not be available.  Also, the Product Numbers mentioned in the RFP are no longer valid (except for Item No 1)  

See response to 3 above
 
5. New software will only be sold inclusive of Support and Maintenance for the first year. Is this sales criterion from HP something that you are aware of?  

See response to 3 above
 
6. The RFP states "This is a brand name requirement due to it is less expensive to maintain the current software than buying new".  What does it imply?  Does it mean that newer versions of the software from the same vendor will not be considered? or....does it mean that new vendors will not be considered?  

A brand name requirement means that we are restricting the items/service required to just this manufacturer’s items.  No other manufacturer’s products will meet our needs.  Other vendor’s offers will be considered if they can provide what is requested. Newer versions cannot be considered for this action since we are not in a position to upgrade at this time.

<DESC>Under Section 6, Basic Functionality, it says:

"A person using a phone/cell shall be able to trigger notifications that include existing groups and scenarios."

Does this mean a person can SEND alerts from the phone/cell or does it mean send notifications that an alert was received?  It would help immensely to clarify this particular requirement.

Response: The Government intends to send alerts from phone/cell.  

If the answer is, alerts must be able to be sent from a phone/cell, can you specify what types of phones/cells are required for this functionality?  For example, it may be possible from the newer smartphones (e.g., iPhones or Blackberry Storm), but not older phones.

Response: The Government intends to send alerts from any phone/cell.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>The U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), specifically the Center for Coastal Management and Assessment (CCMA) is conducting an ongoing research project that requires seafloor characterization and inventory of shallow to mid-water coral reef resources for Vieques, Puerto Rico. CCMA is seeking available sources that can provide a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) with associated equipment and staff to provide a collection of digital underwater color video and still camera data within the Vieques study site. The selected contractor shall supply a ROV with optical imaging equipment capable of operating in water depths of 5 to 300 meters and maintaining a height above the seafloor between 0.5 and 2 meters. The ROV shall have the capability to record both video and underwater still photos for increments of two continuous hours without surfacing and be able to work 12-hour days with less than 4 hours downtime, a low-light color video camera (with at least 460+lines of resolution, auto-iris, 12:1 zoom and auto/manual focus), a static downward-pointing high-resolution camera for taking digital still photos (with at least 3.2 megapixels) at least 30 seconds apart, dual 250-W tungsten-halogen light or equivalent for operating in low-light or nighttime conditions, a strobe flash for taking still pictures (with power at least 76 watts/second) a dual laser scaling device (separation on the order of 10 cm), a tilt platform for maneuvering the camera angle forward and downward between 0 and 90 degrees to horizontal, digital recording capability (DVD for video and JPG for still photos), and a capability to geo position the ROV to 10 m CEP 95 every 1 sec at 300 m depth. The ROV propulsion and control system must be capable of turning and forward/backward vehicle speeds of a minimum of 2 knots. The contractor shall have experience operating a ROV located onboard large oceanographic research vessels, must be capable of deploying and recovering the ROV in up to sea state level 4, and demonstrated experience conducting marine habitat characterization of shallow and deep waster coral ecosystems. The contractor shall provide personnel of sufficient experience and qualifications to manage the collection of video and photograph data near Puerto Rico onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster. We are particularly interested in identifying small businesses that can provide the required services although input is encouraged from large businesses as well. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4.5M. Interested parties with the ability to provide the required services should provide a description of capabilities, experience and references to substantiate ability to provide the required services (maximum of ten pages). This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential sources and to help determine the most effective strategy to procure the required services. Responses are due no later than 12:00 p.m. (noon) local prevailing time on December 10, 2008 to the contracting office address identified above, as well as electronically (in MS Word or PDF format) to the Purchasing Agent, Sandra.K.Souders@noaa.gov.

<DESC>MOD  The synopsis for Solicitation N00019-06-C-0098 posted on www.fbo.gov on 16-October-2008 is hereby revised to reflect a quantity of up to 123 cockpits over the life of the contract.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source contract modification to Lockheed Martin Systems Integration (LMSI), Owego, New York.  It is anticipated that this contract action will be a one-year firm-fixed price contract with a one-year option period for the procurement in FY10-FY11 of Common Cockpit kits for installation on MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters.  This procurement will include the supplies and services necessary to manufacture and deliver the required number of complete Common Cockpit (CC) kits; end of life components; associated spares requirements; support and test equipment; incorporation of deficiency corrections (hardware and software); sustaining engineering for the development of engineering change proposals to cover technology insertion and obsolescence issues; systems/project management; logistics and engineering support; DMSMS; Foreign Military Sales; and repair of repairables.  The total quantity is up to 123 cockpits over the life of this contract.  The Government plans to issue an Advance Acquisition Contract (AAC) for long-lead material and associated efforts supporting this procurement.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  LMSI is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the CC, including the integration of system software and hardware.  LMSI has proprietary rights to the existing data for CC kits and is the only company that possesses the necessary knowledge and technical expertise to complete this effort.  Numbered Note 22.

Section L.14 is added as follows:

L.14 Organizational Conflicts of Interest Disclosure - (Solicitation Provision)  

(a) Organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
(b) An offeror shall provide the statement described in paragraph (c) of this provision. 
(c) The statement must contain the following:
(1)(i) A statement of any past (within the past twelve months), present, or currently planned work for DHS or any of its components in which it is supplying services for the design of hardware or information technology systems, supplying systems engineering services, is supplying support services providing access to procurement planning information, or has any other interest that could create the potential of an organizational conflict of interest if awarded this contract.
(ii) Such statement must include the name, address, telephone number of the client or client(s), a description of the services rendered to the previous client(s), and the name of a responsible officer or employee of the offeror who is knowledgeable about the services rendered to each client, if, in the 12 months preceding the date of the statement, services were rendered to DHS or any other client (including a foreign government or person) respecting the same subject matter of the instant solicitation, or directly relating to such subject matter. The agency and contract number under which the services were rendered must also be included, if applicable. For financial interests, the statement must include the nature and extent of the interest and any entity or entities involved in the financial relationship. For these and any other interests enough such information must be provided to allow a meaningful evaluation of the potential effect of the interest on the performance of the statement of work.
(2) The offeror may provide a proposed method to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any potential for organizational conflict with its proposal. 
(3) A statement that no actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage exists with respect to the services to be provided in connection with the instant contract or that any actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage that does or may exist with respect to the contract in question has been communicated as part of the statement required by (b) of this provision.
(d) Failure of the offeror to provide the required statement may result in the offeror being determined ineligible for award. Misrepresentation or failure to report any fact may result in the assessment of penalties associated with false statements or such other provisions provided for by law or regulation.
