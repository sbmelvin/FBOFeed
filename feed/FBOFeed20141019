<DESC>Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)<br />Indian Health Services<br />Sources Sought
<p>Background<br />Federal government agencies, in conjunction with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), have the responsibility to prohibit discrimination within the civil service on the basis of race, color, religion or religious accommodation, sex, national origin, age, disability or disability accommodation, genetic information, reprisal for opposition to discrimination or participation in the complaint process, and sexual orientation.<br />Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service are not covered under the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws or subject to the provisions of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) &sect;1614.  However, Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" establishes the rights of Commissioned Corps Officers to be free from discrimination and retaliation.<br />Complaints of EEO discrimination alleged by employees of federal agencies or applicants for federal employment covered by Title 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1614 and any subsequent law, statute, regulation, or directive are included within the scope of this Statement of Work (SOW).  Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service covered by the Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" are also included within the scope of this Statement of Work. <br />Objectives</p>
<p>Title 29 CFR Part 1614 requires federal agencies to develop and implement equal employment opportunity programs and complaint processing procedures.  EEOC Management Directive EEO MD-110 implements the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1614.  Federal agencies perform a portion of the required EEO services in house.  This statement of work will outline the roles and responsibilities of each party when the Ordering Agency (Agency) needs to contract out investigative, EEO counseling, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and drafting Final Agency Decision (FAD) functions.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>Investigations of Formal EEO Complaints<br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor.  Three types of discrimination complaints may be investigated; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the investigation is usually performed in four major phases: (a) preparing for the investigation; (b) securing testimony; (c) obtaining documentary evidence and developing statistical information; and (d) preparing the investigative file.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  <br />Counseling of EEO Informal Complaints<br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor.  Three types of discrimination complaints may be counseled; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the EEO Counseling is usually performed in four major phases: (a) Interviewing the Counselee, Responsible Management Official(s) (RMO), and witnesses; (b) framing the claims and drafting management's and witnesses' responses to the claims; (c) obtaining documentary evidence and statistical information; and (d) preparing the counseling report and related documents.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)<br />The Agency will determine when an aggrieved person or complainant is to be referred to the Contractor for ADR services.  Three types of discrimination complaints may be referred; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is usually performed in six major phases: (a) Reviewing the Agency dispute file; (b) Developing an ADR Action Plan; (c) Setting up Meetings/Caucuses between the Parties; (d) Reviewing the ADR process with the Parties; (e) Identifying the issues; and either (f) Assisting the Parties in putting a proposed settlement agreement in writing and develop a draft settlement agreement or notifying the Parties if efforts to settle the dispute have been unsuccessful.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.</p>
<p>Drafting a Final Agency Decision <br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor.  Three types of discrimination complaints may require written FADs; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the FAD is usually performed in four major phases: (a) reviewing the Report of Investigation (ROI); (b) Drafting a presentation of facts; (c) conducting and drafting a legal analysis of the claims based on the information and evidence in the ROI; and (d) drafting recommended findings, conclusions, and, if applicable, appropriate remedies.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Investigation of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Reports of Investigation<br />The purpose of this subsection is to obtain Reports of Investigation in conformance with the standards established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  Investigations shall be performed to identify and obtain evidence from all relevant sources and gather sufficient information, relevant to the accepted issues in the complaint, to determine the validity of the allegations.  If the Agency determines a violation of the applicable laws occurred, the Report of Investigation must provide the Agency with a sufficient factual basis from which to fashion an appropriate remedy.<br />Investigations shall include a thorough review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred and the treatment of others not of the complainant's class in the organizational segment.  Additionally, the investigation shall require a review of any policies and practices related to the alleged discrimination.  <br />1.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS), Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint and the number of issues contained in each complaint.  Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint and/or number of issues, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.  If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2. EEO Counseling of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Counseling Reports<br />2.1 Purpose<br />The purpose of the EEO Counseling inquiry is to obtain information regarding the claim(s), address jurisdictional questions, and attempt to facilitate a resolution to the Counselee's requested remedy.  The EEO Counselor should interview persons who can provide information that is relevant to the claim(s), settlement, and jurisdictional questions.  The EEO counseling inquiry is not an "investigation" nor is it intended to resolve disputed facts; rather, it is simply gathering information necessary for the EEO Counselor to assist the parties in resolving the matter.  The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency.  Documents generated through EEO Counseling should adhere to Agency formats, style guide requirements, and unless approved in writing, use Agency-provided forms and materials.<br />2.2 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the  Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint.  Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.  If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2.3 Requirements of the Contractor<br />To perform EEO counseling, the Contractor shall:<br />Provide to the ACP within 2 business days from receipt of case assignment the name, contact information, and, if not previously provided, documentation of current counseling certification. <br />Furnish all essential equipment, materials, personnel, and supplies necessary to perform all of the work detailed herein, including conducting EEO counseling and preparing the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor will immediately notify the ACP in writing providing details sufficient for the ACP to advise Agency leadership if any of the following occurs:<br />Any individual involved in the EEO Counseling process advises that he/she needs a reasonable accommodation or is unable to perform work duties due to a disability.<br />Any individual involved in the EEO counseling process advises that he/she is a threat to himself or others, or words to that effect, or that any other employee or contractor is a threat to self or others or words to that effect.<br />Conduct EEO Counseling via telephonic interviews, unless otherwise impracticable, at which point in-person interviews are permitted with prior written authorization from the COR.  Any alternate method for conducting EEO Counseling must be approved in writing and in advance, of the EEO counseling, by the COR.<br />The EEO Counselor shall contact the Counselee within three (3) days of assignment to schedule the Initial interview.<br />The Initial interview with the Counselee should be conducted as soon as possible after receiving assignment, but no later than eight (8) days of assignment.  If the Counselee has provided documentation of representation using the Agency-provided form, the EEO Counselor must include the representative in all correspondence, email, telephone conversations, interviews, and any other contact with the Counselee.  Unusual circumstances that may prevent conducting the interview immediately; e.g., illness, emergency leave, priority assignments, must be brought to the attention of the ACP.<br />The EEO Counselor should request , within two (2) business days of the initial interview with Counselee, any documents from the ACP and/or the COR that the EEO Counselor believes are relevant to the limited inquiry.  <br />The EEO Counselor must request all relevant documentation regarding the matters raised in counseling from the ACP and the Counselee only (all requests for documents, except for requests to the Counselee, must be made to the ACP or COR). <br />The EEO Counselor must instruct the Counselee to submit all requested/offered documents to the ACP and instruct all witnesses to submit any documents they offer in support of their interviews to the ACP EEO Counselor.  The EEO Counselor will review the documents and determine they are to be included in the EEO Counselor's Report within three (3) business days of receipt from the Counselee/witnesses. If the EEO Counselor has any questions regarding the inclusion of the submitted documents with the EEO Counselor's Report, then the EEO Counselor shall check with the ACP for guidance on the matter.  <br />The EEO Counselor shall interview all witnesses, including the RMO, within twenty (20) days of the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency. Prior to contacting anyone other than the Counselee, and if applicable, the Counselee's representative, the EEO Counselor must obtain written authorization from the ACP or COR.<br />The Contractor must notify the ACP immediately if a Counselee or witness refuses to cooperate with the limited inquiry.  The ACP will take appropriate steps to secure the witness' cooperation and remind the witness of his/her duty to cooperate with the inquiry.  If the Counselee and/or witness ultimately fail to cooperate with the EEO Counselor, the EEO Counselor must document all attempts to secure the cooperation of that uncooperative witness or Counselee in the Counseling Report and attach any documentation, such as emails, to the Report. <br />The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency.  <br />The EEO Counselor shall write-up each interview after completion, and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor shall review and summarize all documents relevant to the claim(s) and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />If the EEO Counselor believes the inquiry is deficient procedurally, or in content or scope, he/she shall immediately notify the COR.<br />By the 26th day after the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency, if the EEO Counselor has not completed the counseling process, the EEO Counselor should contact the Counselee regarding obtaining an extension.<br />A Counselee may agree, in writing, to postpone the Final Interview and extend the period for pre-complaint counseling for up to or less than sixty (60) additional calendar days from the date of the Initial contact.<br />Any extension of counseling must be requested by the EEO Counselor to the ACP and/or COR prior to the expiration of the initial thirty (30) day period.<br />Because timely completion of Pre-complaint counseling increases the probability of informal resolution and minimizes the negative impact that protracted inquiries have on the work environment, requests for extensions of EEO Counseling should be requested from the COR and/or ACP only in the following instances:</p>
<p>With the written consent of the Counselee; or<br />Requested by the Counselee; or<br />Unusual circumstances which prevented completion of the counseling inquiry during the initial thirty (30) day period, i.e., illness, travel, or emergency leave of the Counselee, a primary witness; or<br />When the Agency believes that informal resolution is likely or imminent, and a short additional counseling period is necessary to consummate an agreement.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor should attempt to facilitate a resolution of the pre-complaint.  If the Counselee and the Agency agree to an informal resolution of the dispute during the course of the EEO counseling inquiry, the terms of the informal resolution should be reduced to writing, and provided to the ACP or COR, and sent to the EEO Office for final review and approval by the EEO Office for form and compliance purposes. The EEO Counselor may not provide said document to anyone other than the ACP or COR.</p>
<p>If the Counselee elects to withdraw the Pre-complaint, the withdrawal must be obtained in writing using Agency-provided forms.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor is responsible for submitting a final Counselor's Report, regardless of whether the Pre-complaint is withdrawn, settled, resolved, went to ADR or is completed in any other manner, along with all paperwork gathered during the counseling process to the EEO office within three (3) days of conducting the Final Interview, within three (3) days of the conclusion of EEO Counseling, whether by final interview or otherwise, but no later than the 29th day from the Counselor's Initial contact with the Agency, unless the Counselee has authorized an extension using Agency-provided forms.  If such an extension was granted, the Counseling materials are due no later than seven (7) days before the end of the extension period.</p>
<p><br />Submit a weekly status report of all open EEO Counseling cases to the COR; or submit a status report of any and all open EEO Counseling cases upon the request of the COR in a format acceptable to the COR.</p>
<p>Perform EEO Counseling and have access to data related to any complaint only after providing a signed Nondisclosure Agreement for all personnel assigned under this Statement of Work.<br />Review all relevant personnel records and statistical data and make copies as needed for inclusion in the Counselor's Report.<br />3.

Preparation of Final Agency Decisions<br />4.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint.   Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.  If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />4.2 Case Assignment<br />The COR will electronically forward the case assignment; the ACP will, depending on the size of the document files, electronically or via a nationally recognized mail service, forward the Report of Investigation (ROI) and the case file.

Generally, where compensatory damages are appropriate, an award amount will not be given in the original FAD, unless sufficient information was provided in the ROI to make that determination.  Instead, the complainant will be advised that compensatory damages may be available and will be provided with guidance on the procedure used for requesting, proving, and determining compensatory damage awards.</p>
<p>The analysis of each claim must follow established rules, regulations and legal principles and precedents.  The FAD must clearly identify which theory of discrimination is being applied, i.e., disparate treatment, hostile work environment harassment, and/or adverse impact.<br />Case law precedents relied on in the FAD will be cited and will be in accordance with the EEOCG Style Guide.
