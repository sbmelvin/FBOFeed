<DESC>This is an announcement for a solicitation to be posted to FEDBIZOPS.GOV in the near future.
<p>Work is located at Building 171, Randolph AFB, Texas. The Contractor shall provide all materials, labor, equipment for removing and replacing electrical, structure and mechanical systems to prepare 18 Bays for the installation of new vehicle lifts that will be purchased and installed at a later date. Contractor is not responsible for the installation of the new vehicle lifts. All work shall conform to American Concrete Institute (ACI) specifications and meet all current Federal, State, AF Facilities, and local requirements. The procurement will be issued as a firm fixed-price contract open to all Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Business concerns under NAICS 238110, Poured Concrete Foundation and Structure Contractors. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00 US Dollars with an anticipated project duration of approximately 180 days.<br /><br />The existing work bays (East Bay 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and West Bay 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) of Building 171 consist of a compound floor slope design that is unsuitable for safe, efficient vehicle repair work. Equipment in a vehicle maintenance facility must be positioned on a consistently level floor surface in order to be properly and safely operated. The slope of each work bay area was originally intended to channel fluid into the shop floor drains. However, most of the fluid drains into the lift wells and ultimately causes damage to the Below Ground Lift (BGL) systems. This project shall provide level floors for new lifts to be operated safely. The Contractor shall construct floor slabs in accordance with design drawings and Statement of Work which will be released with the Request for Proposal.<br />There will be only ONE site visit for this project.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action by the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center's Enterprise Acquisition Division, Hanscom AFB, MA to award a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for reinstatement of OPNET software and maintenance licenses produced by OPNET Technologies Incorporated, Bethesda, MD under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. This acquisition is for the purchase of OPNET software and maintenance license renewal.&nbsp; OPNET has&nbsp;been found to be&nbsp;the only program to satisfy the government requirement as the Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) Program Office previously purchased a MADL engineering model at a cost of over $5M, which was developed in and will only run in OPNET, a decision made by the contractor building the model. To not utilize the model the government has invested in would result in a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition. Additionally, market research has shown OPNET to be&nbsp;the lead software&nbsp;among wireless communication experts for emulating Department of Defense communication systems and satellite interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no solicitation document available for this acquisition. Interested sources shall make written inquires about this procurement to Ms. Lindsay Walsh, Contract Specialist, at Lindsay.Walsh@Hanscom.af.mil no later than 19 May 2011. This acquisition is conducted utilizing simplified acquisition procedures defined by FAR Part 13. The response time is reduced from fifteen (15) to seven (7) days.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of CIS support for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.<br /><br />NC3A will conduct the competition in accordance with Alliance Operations and Mission (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The contract will be awarded on a lowest price, technically compliant basis.<br /><br />The estimated cost for the services and deliverables included within the basic scope of the intended contract is &euro;750,000. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13197-AMN. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.<br /><br />NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.<br /><br />The IFB package will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Prospective bidders should be aware, however, that contractor personnel will be required to hold security clearances at the level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.<br /><br />SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />The project provides four mini Points-of-Presence (mini PoPs) that will enable deploying ISAF staff in support of theatre forces to securely send and receive operational information to the wider Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN) Core using any available bearer. Additionally, the project upgrades the five mini PoPs that have already been delivered to ISAF.<br /><br />The capability will permit deploying staff in support of theatre forces to securely send and receive operational information to the wider AMN Core and provide communication services such as Chat, VoSIP, E-mail, FFT, Secure Video Teleconference (SVTC) and web browsing. The mini PoPs shall be highly deployable, scalable, modular, and shall support up to eight users (six users with secure access at NATO SECRET level to functional area services (FAS), and two users at NATO UNCLASSIFIED level). Each mini PoP shall be one-man transportable and shall provide network interfaces compatible with any transmission bearer of opportunity. The five mini PoPs upgrade will increase the system's durability, resilience, and capabilities.<br /><br />The mini PoPs will need to be fully configured, tested, documented, and&nbsp;fielded in ISAF. Furthermore, appropriate training (in garrison and in ISAF) must be provided.<br /><br />BIDDING PROCEDURE<br /><br />Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br /><br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br /><br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm<br /><br />The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:<br /><br />- the title and solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents<br /><br />After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.<br /><br />Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.<br /><br />IMPORTANT DATES:<br />1) Request DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed NATO ICB application) no later than May 19, 2011<br />2) Release of IFB planned for late May 2011<br />3) Bid Closing in late June 2011<br />4) Contract Award expected to take place in 3rd quarter of 2011<br />

<p><br />I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Secretary of the Air Force Office of Small Business Programs is requesting white papers as part of Step 1, (and later in Step 2: technical and cost proposals) open to eligible mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to provide the Air Force a strong technical component or innovative state of the art technology that will meet Air Force mission requirements.</p>
<p>1. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this Department of Defense (DoD) program is to provide incentives to prime DoD contractors to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements. This is accomplished by technical and developmental assistance from the mentor to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Under this program, approved mentor firms will enter into Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; (MP) agreements with eligible prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided at http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/mentor_protege/downloads/index.htm and http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/mentor_protege/ and in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 219.71 and Appendix I of the DFARS http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html. <br />Attachments 1, 2 and 3 provide detailed Air Force Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program information, as well as www.AirForceSmallBiz.org. <br />Proposed agreements consisting primarily of business infrastructure, management and marketing assistance will not be considered for approval. <br />The Air Force requests MP agreements that are in line with the Air Force Vision and Priority areas while delivering requirements that contain a strong technical component or focus on innovative state of the art technology. The Air Force's mission is to Fly, Fight and Win in Air Space and Cyberspace. The Air Force priorities are listed below: <br />AIR FORCE PRIORITY AREAS:</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547-1804 for the purchase of the following equipment:</p>
<p>- DEMO CFX384 RT PCR DETECT SYSTEM</p>
<p>The CFX384 real-time PCR system has the ability to test 384 samples in a single run and will be able to run samples as well as control them simultaneously. A qPCR machine allows you to look at the number of specific molecules on a transcriptional level. Unlike standard PCR machines that only show the presence or absence of a gene, a qPCR allows for the quantification of the molecule showing increases and decreases in genes after treatment to the samples. This is important when looking at mutations present in cancer samples as well as the cell lines used in the lab.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that this piece of equipment can only be purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories because they are the original manufacturer and sole supplier. In addition, all members of the Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch at NIDCR will be able to use this machine for their research and it is compatible with the Bio-Rad Icycler iQ System currently being used.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, and is not a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-51 (April 1, 2011).</p>

<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to procure a Inhalation Exposure System from Glas-Col, P.O. Box 2128, Terre Haute, IN 47802-1629.&nbsp; The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Genetic Disease Research Branch (GDRB) currently does not have an apparatus that will allow exposure to pathogenic agents for animal studies. The mission of the laboratory is to characterize the pathology of viral lung infection induced liver dysfunction. The laboratory must be able to faithfully reproduce a lung-confined viral infection in mouse models in order to study its effects on liver metabolism. In the research study, GDRB need to assess the biology of liver dysfunction due to respiratory viral infection. This clinical scenario will require the ability to infect large groups of animals at once in a reproducible way.</p>
<p>The Inhalation Exposure System from Glas-Col is a contained system for delivery of droplet-borne contaminants and infectious agents to provide reproducible animal exposure. The system also produces deep-lung infections that closely simulate real-world circumstances. Also, it allows a researcher to vary the concentration of airborne pathogens, the rate of air flow, and the length of exposure, so experiments can be reproduced accurately and adjusted easily. The Glas-Col system is a proven method of aerosolized infection that emulates natural infection. Additionally, Glas-Col provides the unit as well as user training necessary for machine operation and maintenance. A nasal exposure system is not acceptable, only a system that provides deep lung infection will meet the requirement and acceptable.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Items:<br /><br /></span></strong>1. Inhalation Exposure System without basket, Side Access Panel, Item ID: 099C 0616700025, Quantity: One (1) Each.<br />2.

 Work will attain compliance with Life Safety.  

The magnitude of the project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00 (See FARS 36.204).

NAVFAC EURAFSWA plans to award one (1) firm fixed price construction (FFP) contract. The FFP contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and will offer the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable to the government. 

Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to proposal submissions. Offerors may obtain information on registration requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), PMM-131, Program Manager Reconnaissance and Amphibious Raids (PM RAR) intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation for a five (5) year Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) Contract composed of a base year and four (4) out years. MCSC will award to the lowest priced technically acceptable small business. The award will include a minimum of three (3) hours per year and a maximum of twelve (12) hours per year for vertical wind tunnel flying hours. 

The PM RAR manages the procurement, delivery, operation and maintenance of all Military Free-Fall testing and training requirements.
 In order to safely meet the MCSC requirements, PM RAR has a need to establish a contract for wind tunnel flying hours to support mission requirements to develop, demonstrate, procure, field, and provide life-cycle management for Airborne/Parachuting and associated equipment for the Marine Operating Forces (MARFORs). To this end, a requirement exists for a capability to evaluate parachute systems and accessories. The ability to conduct simulated free-fall in a controlled environment provides an increased level of safety for our evaluators. Parachute systems and components expected for evaluation include items such as parachute packs, parachutists helmets, navigation tools, and weapons slings/pouches.
 Parachutists also require maintaining proficiency in parachuting procedures and techniques. 

Wind tunnels are vertical rooms or buildings that generate wind and re-circulate air flow to simulate freefalling during parachute operations. Availability of a wind tunnel will provide a means to attain this training when mission aircraft are not available, increasing the flexibility for scheduling training.

<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 with a size standard of 500.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below product within 120 days after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>The NHLBI on behalf of the NIDCR is seeking to purchase a confocal microscope system to couple with an inverted tissue culture microscope and stereo microscope.  Some work in the NIDCR Division of Intramural Research (DIR) consists of the molecular, cellular and developmental characterization of ppGalNAcTs and their substrates, the mucin-type O-glycans. To conduct these studies, we rely largely in qualitative and quantitative morphological studies by using a broad range of imaging techniques in various model systems including mice, sea urchin and cells grown in vitro. Because we use multiple model systems with very unique features, and because we are trying to address many biological question including subcellular distribution and protein-protein interaction analysis, we need a flexible confocal microscope that can provide us among other things with high quality and high resolution images of superb sensitivity, a user-friendly software platform, the ability to do 3D imaging, multi-fluorophore (spectral) acquisition, and live cell imaging capabilities (temperature control, high sensitivity, pixel precise control of illumination and fast acquisition).  In addition, we require software that enables us to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to accomplish colocalization studies, ratiometric imaging, FRAP/FRET studies, identification of autofluorescence and 3D reconstructions and measurements (including volume, surface area, length, radius of sphere with equivalent volume and maximum and minimum Feret's diameter). Therefore the confocal microscope we need to purchase must contain some unique and specific features.  In addition, we need to have a flexible system that is compatible with the confocal microscope we are purchasing so we can easily change optics and filter sets to observe cells under different magnifications and cells expressing different trans-genes.   Below are the Government required specifications</p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<p>1.	The confocal system must have a Variable Secondary Dichroic beam splitter (VDS) optical continuous spectral element that allows free separation at any point in the visible spectrum to separate the light to all detectors thereby providing full variable spectral separation of fluorophores.  <br />2.	The system must have freely configurable detection settings with no limitation on either side of the detection wavelength limiting bandwidth.<br />3.	The system must have low noise electronic design which would allow for Digital Gain boost in addition to master Gain pedestal on detector.<br />4.	System must acquire images in 8, 12 or 16 bit.<br />5.	Image resolution must reach 2000x2000 pixels.<br />6.

<DESC>I. The United States Marine Corps is seeking information for the implementation of a digital communications capability and the migration of the Solaris 10 Operating System from a SPARC based computer to an intel based computer for the Ground Counter Fire Sensor System (GCFS).  A digital communications capability will allow for the GCFS to connect to the Global Information Grid and exchange information with existing C4I systems such as the Advance Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).

The Ground Counter Fire Sensor (GCFS) is a stand-alone system that provides the Marine Corps continuous passive acquisition of acoustic events (mortar and artillery fire) and calculates the geographic point of origin for each event.
  The GCFS can be used as a stand-alone system to provide enemy weapons locations or in coordination with other indirect fire detection assets to collaborate detection information or as a cueing agent.  The GCFS also provides intelligence to supported units by providing the location of acoustic events such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  The GCFS is an off the shelf system that provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force the capability to rapidly and accurately conduct counter fire operations.  The GCFS provides all weather, 360 degree, indirect fire target acquisition, and continuous passive acquisition of acoustic events and related calculations of point of origin and point of impacts.
  

The GCFS currently displays data at the Command Post, requiring system operators to read and pass this data to fire support and intelligence structures manually.  In order to improve responsiveness the GCFS shall be capable of providing these acquisitions via digital communications architecture to the AFATDS.  Migration to an intel based computer will allow for a wider range of platforms that can be configured with the GCFS system.
The Ground Counter Fire Sensor (GCFS) is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) system acquired from the OEM Selex-Galileo in 2005 which achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) in June 2006.  The Government anticipates potential sources will need to obtain access to proprietary technical data and/or related intellectual property owned by the OEM in order to be capable of meeting our requirements.
  The OEM, Selex-Galileo, may be contacted directly at:

Sigma House, Christopher Martin Road
Basildon, Essex
SS14 3EL
Telephone: +44 (0) 1268 522822

II. The performance specifications and compliance requirements that follow describe the specific characteristics that are required to provide the desired capability.

a. The GCFS shall be able to transmit digital messages to AFATDS.
b. The GCFS digital communications software shall use the Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) to receive or transmit information to the AFATDS.
c. Output from the GCFS shall comply with all Net-Ready and Inter-operability requirements as per CJCSI 6212.01_ and DOD CIO Ipv6 Memorandum of 8 October 2003.
d.
 Incorporate data exchange between AFATDS and GCFS to include the transmittal and receipt of the following JVMF message types:  Adjust Fire, Artillery Target Intelligence, Position Report, Sensor Deployment Order, S Sensor, and MET Message, 
e. The GCFS digital communications software shall be in compliance with all National, DOD, Navy and Marine Corps information assurance (IA) regulations.
f.  The GCFS digital communications software shall comply with DODI 4630.8, Procedures for Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS) dated 30 June 2004 to ensure IT and NSS interoperability, supportability, and IA are designed, developed, tested, evaluated, and incorporated into all DOD component IT and NSS.
g.
 The digital communications software and migration of system software to an intel based PC shall not degrade the operational capability of the baseline system.
h. The digital communications software shall be able to operate on the GCFS Command Post Computer.

III. Vendor responses should also provide information on the following topics:

a. Proposed concept for meeting the requirements.
b. CMMI maturity level for the organization
c. Estimated cost
d. Software size information, software size definitions, and re-use estimates with rationale to support software estimation
e. Company background in development of similar systems, including knowledge of GCFS if applicable, supporting ability to execute project scope.
 
f. Proposed software development schedule consistent with the proposed technical content.

IV. Vendors capable of providing a system that demonstrates the performance specifications and characteristics stated above are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Vendors should submit detailed descriptions of any candidates to include drawings, pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the operating principles as well as general and specific software capabilities behind the submissions and their ability to meet the requirements above.  Vendors should describe any past or current contracts whose deliverables satisfy items covered in this announcement.  The Government expects to procure Government purpose rights for the GCFS digital communications software.
  Vendors should provide information regarding the level and licensing costs associated with these rights. 
Interested sources are requested to respond no later than
4:30pm EST on 15 June 2011 stating their CAGE Code, DUNS number, copy of GSA schedule, business size, SIC Code, and the complete contract information for a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to:

Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, 
ATTN:  FSS/Contracts (attn: L.D. Gillman), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.  

V. Proprietary information shall be clearly marked.  

VI. This RFI is for planning purposes and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as obligation on the part of the Government to acquire products or services.
  Responses shall be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government.  

All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government, no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government as a result of contractor responses to this announcement.  

Documentation provided will not be returned.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Project Proposals, but for planning purposes only. Aproject award will not be awarded from this announcement. The Government intends to announce a Request for Project Proposals for execution of a project award in support of Ground Robotics related research areas. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make multiple project awards to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The anticipated Research Area for which project proposals will be sought is as follows: Counter Tunnel Exploitation, Mapping, and Characterization.

The Request for Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RPP12) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium. For information on the Robotics Technology Consortium and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://www.roboticstechc.org/.

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for a service in which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source, the Dartmouth Medical College, under the authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (a)(2) only one responsible source, 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).    The requirement is for a Scientific Advisory Consultant to assist the University of Rochester in researching and writing grant proposals for two applications: 1).  The Increasing Treatment among Veterans calling the Veterans Crisis Line and 2). Increasing Help-Seeking Among At-risk Soldiers. The Scientific Advisroy Consultant will research divisions both in VA and American Institute of Biological Sciences which manages suicide research proposals for the U.S. Army.   The Scientific Advisory Consultant will assist in the scientific development of two separate grant applications to improve help-seeking among at-risk Veterans and active duty soldiers in the Army.  Specifically, the Scientific Advisory Consultant will provide input on (1) the research design of each proposal, (2) the methodological approach and development of measurement instruments, and (3) the statistical analysis of each of the two studies.  

The scientific goals for these two studies have been divided into two grant applications because the respective proposals focus on different populations including 1) Veterans of the military calling a crisis line and 2) active duty service members in the Army.  Although the PI is an expert in suicide research, the scope of work of these two grant applications is of a magnitude to warrant additional scientific assistance, and in particular, from a Scientific Advisory Consultant who has specific expertise in developing and testing brief, practical interventions to promote behavioral health treatment seeking for conditions that increase suicide risk in military populations.  

The Scientific Advisory Consultant must be an expert in the development and testing of an intervention to increase help seeking among individuals who show behavioral health symptoms including PTSD that are known to confer risk for suicidal behavior in military populations.  The Scientific Advisory Consultant must also have expertise using an intervention that is brief and can be delivered by phone to make it practical for use with 1) Veterans who live throughout the U.S. calling a crisis line and 2) U.S. Army soldiers who may be deployed.  The Scientific Advisory Consultant must also have expertise using the intervention with military populations.  The development of the two grant applications will be informed by the Scientific Advisory Consultants prior and ongoing work in developing and testing a brief, phone-based intervention to increase help seeking in military populations with behavioral health symptoms (e.g., PTSD) that confer risk for suicidal behavior.   

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received by 10:00 a.m. EST on May 19, 2011 will considered by the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to the requirement via email.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on responses received as a result of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  Interested parties may email information to Les.Lecceardone@va.gov as no phone inquiries will be taken.   NAICS code is 622210 Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospital with a size standard $34.5 million.  The proposed contract type will be Firm Fixed Price.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY .  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining industry comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a stewardship contract that will provide the services needed at the lowest possible cost or even negative cost to the Government in regard to the general requirement stated below.   The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. 


ProjectName:  
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) Project 

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Southwestern Region (AZ and NM) of the Forest Service intends to perform a  large, minimum, multi-year forest restoration project in central Arizona under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act.  The overall objective is to treat approximately 1 million acres of ponderosa pine forest types by thinning and harvesting mainly small diameter trees in excess of ecological requirements under a number of 10-year stewardship contracts.  This process could take up to 20 to 30 years as contracts are awarded presupposing that the Stewardship Contracting Authority is extended.  This would yield up to 8 to 10 million CCF (100 cubic feet) of wood fiber.  The rate of treatments under the first contract is anticipated to be a minimum of 30,000 acres per year over a ten-year contract period.  It is expected that most treatment areas would accommodate ground-based harvest systems with some temporary road construction requirements and minor amounts of specified road reconstruction.  Areas proposed for treatment are scattered across four forests  Tonto, Kaibab, Coconino, and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  

The purpose of this request is to begin to identify issues specific to an RFP with regards to the needs of the forest industry.  For example: 
1.	How would you structure existing industries to efficiently harvest and utilize the full spectrum of available raw material which includes biomass, roundwood, and sawlogs.
2.	How would you propose to structure partnerships with other businesses that would enable costs for treatment to be at or near zero?
3.	How long would your plant take to construct and how long after award would you anticipate the plant starting production?  
4.	After start up, assuming there is a gradual increase to full production, how long do you anticipate that you would need to be at full production? 
5.	How long after contract award would you need to start harvest and removal of logs or other forest residue?
6.	How much wood would you project for the first year after award, what amount in year two, etc?  
7.	What amount of wood do you project needing at full production?  
8.	Would you prefer the contract be with your company, and you would subcontract to the logging companies; or would you prefer a logging contractor be the primary contractor with a separate contract with your company?


There is no formal contract at present, the exact acres to be treated have not all been identified, and the exact amount of wood to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.  However, a supply assessment has determined that there is a large sustainable supply for up to 20 years projected, and the Forest Service is confident that the volumes will be substantial and firm.  From this information it is projected that there will be more contracts of comparable size in the future.  

THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS:

Now is the time to provide us with any critical comments or ideas related to this project.  If there is something that we need to consider in developing the RFP, which will help make this project a success for all of us, whether it has been specifically asked or not, please let us know.  Once we begin putting the RFP together, we must maintain a considerable degree of confidentiality.  

We plan to solicit proposals late in calendar year 2010 or early 2011 and award in early to mid calendar year 2012.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western  Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) of New Hyde Park, NY, for surface radiation monitoring at Prospect Hill, Bermuda as part of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN).
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration's (NOAA) market research and expert knowledge in determining that BIOS is a unique source to provide the specialized monitoring capability at this particular BSRN site in Bermuda since BIOS owns and operates the monitoring site and is co-located with other climate monitoring activities.  Continuity and accuracy of the long term radiation record is the foremost priority. Inter-comparison with other sampling values that are co-located at this site are also very important and required in validating the climate research conducted there by the ESRL/Global Monitoring Division and other joint partnerships.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to increase small business size standards for 22 industries in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 48 49, Transportation and Warehousing.   As part of its ongoing initiative to review all size standards, SBA has evaluated all industries in NAICS Sector 48 49 that have receipts based size standards to determine whether the size standards should be retained or revised.  This rule is one of a series of proposed rules that will examine industries grouped by a NAICS Sector.  SBA has issued a White Paper entitled "Size Standards Methodology" and published in the October 21, 2009 issue of the Federal Register a notice that "Size Standards Methodology" is available on its website at www.sba.gov/size for public review and comments.  The "Size Standards Methodology" White Paper explains how SBA establishes, reviews and modifies its receipts based and employee based small business size standards.  In this proposed rule, SBA has applied its methodology that pertains to establishing, reviewing and modifying a receipts based size standard.
<p>We invite you to review the proposed rule and submit your comments. The proposed rule explains how to submit your comments to SBA.  We recommend that you comment through the Federal eRulemaking Portal: www.regulations.gov.  Follow the instructions there for submitting your comments.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission of comments is July 12, 2011.</p>
<p>You can read/download the proposed rule at www.regulations.gov (RIN-3245-AG08).</p>

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />&bull; The Offeror must show that the past performance (at least 3 but no more than 5 with offeror being Prime in at least 1 of the references) demonstrates a solid, proven track record (within the last 5 years), for projects similar in scope and size, with demonstrated results as well as proven past performance in the areas outlined in the Performance Work Statement and required Deliverables.</p>
<p>PRICE:<br />&bull; The Offeror shall provide a price proposal for the period of performance to include base plus options for all of the information shown in Schedule B of the RFP. <br />&bull; The Offeror shall provide a breakdown of all labor categories, rates and hours associated with proposed pricing. <br />&bull; The Offeror is not required to price travel as travel is not authorized. <br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal when compared to price.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Award will be made to the best value proposal with consideration given to the preference to Women-Owned Small Business, which is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government wherein the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance or reduced risk than in making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government.</p>

<RESPDATE>060111
<CONTACT>Ryan L Singletary, Email Ryan.singletary@nih.gov
<DESC><br />NLM Internet Connectivity
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure high speed Internet connectivity to the National Library of Medicine's network which is located in Bethesda, Maryland. This will provide commodity Internet access to the public as well as the research and medical communities around the world. This connectivity needs to be provided via a Global Tier 1 Internet Service Provider (ISP). It must also include protected circuit connections from the ISP Point of Presence (POP) to NLM. These connections cannot be provided by the current ISPs that are presently being used by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) within the National Institutes of Health Network (NIHNET), since NLM uses the CIT/NIH internet connections as a backup. This connectivity must initially provide 2 Gbps bandwidth. The provider must have the capability to upgrade the connections up to 10 Gbps bandwidth.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 517110 with a small business standard of 1,500. This competition is full and open. The anticipated base year period of performance is September 1, 2011 - August 31, 2012 with four option years.</p>
<p>Background <br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the US and around the globe search the Library's online information resources more than one billion times each year. Large data sets are also frequently exchanged among NLM and its research partners domestically and internationally. <br />The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) of the National Library of Medicine provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences in support of the research and management programs offered through the NLM.</p>
<p>OCCS develops, operates, and maintains the backbone computer network and facilities, and supports, guides, and assists other NLM components in local area networking. The Division provides professional programming services and computational and data processing facilities to meet NLM program needs; operates and maintains the NLM Network Operations and Computing Facility; designs and develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses and seminars, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS helps to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available throughout all of the organizations comprising NLM. The Division also serves as a technological resource for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs. The Division promotes the application of High Performance Computing and Communication to biomedical problems, including image processing and information security.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The scope of this procurement is the acquisition of Internet services and related communications circuits that will provide commodity Internet connection for the NLM at the Bethesda, Maryland location.</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>1. The contractor must be considered a Global Tier 1 ISP.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine defines a Global Tier 1 ISP as one that has the following attributes:</p>
<p>&bull; provides connections to the Internet via settlement-free interconnections. This means that there are not overt charges for the amount, direction, or type of traffic sent between networks;<br />&bull; has access to the entire Internet routing table through their peering relationships;<br />&bull; are interconnected at Internet Exchange (IX) points;<br />&bull; are not dependent on other ISPs to manage private peering;<br />&bull; peer on more than one continent; and<br />&bull; own or lease transoceanic fiber optic transport.</p>
<p>2. The contractor must not be a part of the NIH/CIT Internet service solution</p>
<p>In the event of an outage to NLM's primary Internet service connection, NLM fails over to NIH/CIT's ISP service as a backup connection, therefore due to NLM's high availability requirements for Internet service, an award will be made to an ISP that is not currently providing Internet Service to NIH/CIT.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit electronic responses to Ryan Singletary at ryan.singletary@nih.gov and mail four hard copies to:</p>
<p>Ryan Singletary<br />Contract Specialist<br />6707 Democracy Blvd<br />Suite 105, MSC 5488<br />Bethesda, MD 20892</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than 3:00 PM EST on June 1, 2011. Please reference solicitation number NLM-10-167-RLS on all correspondence to this notice. Questions and inquiries regarding this notice may be sent to ryan.singletary@nih.gov until May 27, 2011.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

QUOTES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED<br />GROWTH WORK<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.<br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.<br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.<br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing<br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.<br />(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY --No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.<br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT -The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />United States Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3695<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p>Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Rating: DO A3.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

PLEASE COMPLETE AND SUBMIT THE ATTACHED RETURN PACKAGE. <br /><br />***RETURN BY MAY 23, 2011 @ 9:00AM MST***<br /><br /><br />*** A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PAC LOCATIONS ARE LISTED BELOW IN BOLD PRINT. THE ACTUAL TRAILS, FOREST SERVICE ROAD AND MAPS WILL BE RELEASED DURING THE PRE-WORK MEETING ALONG WITH ALL GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, supplies, transportation, equipment and materials (except for Government furnished property) needed to conduct formal monitoring of sixteen known Mexican spotted owl (MSO) Protected Activity Centers (PACs) in the San Mateo and Magdalena Mountains of central New Mexico. All monitoring will be done according to established protocol to determine presence/absence and reproductive success.</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit completed forms, maps, digital images and a final report of all findings.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended, but not necessary. Conditions of track roads can be poor when wet. Some of the access roads can be rough.</p>
<p>The 2011 weather is forecast for warm temperatures and continued dry conditions. The entire Cibola National Forest was under Fire Restrictions in the past and restrictions are expected this year. Campfires, charcoal grills and stove fires were prohibited on national forest lands except in developed camp and picnic grounds where grills were provided. Smoking was allowed within an enclosed vehicle or building; a developed recreation site; or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter and free of all flammable material. If dry conditions continue, the District may be under a total closure again during the 2011 MSO monitoring season. In that case, the contractor may be given specific written permission to continue survey work during the closure.</p>
<p>Mexican spotted owl Monitoring</p>
<p>MSO monitoring may be performed beginning as soon as the contract is awarded and will be completed by August 31, 2011. Upon completion of the field survey, the Contractor shall have 21 calendar days to deliver the Final Report to the COR.</p>
<p>Informal monitoring and/or pre-calling daytime visits may be done to known nest sites within MSO PACs during dates established in the MSO protocol included in this package (Pre-calling Daytime Visits). If MSO are located during informal and/or pre-calling visits, only reproductive success visits would need to be done thereafter.</p>
<p>If MSO are not located during daytime visits, formal MSO monitoring shall be performed according to the MSO protocol attached to this contract package. Only the actual PAC areas need formal monitoring.</p>
<p>Any location marking method, such as flagging or Brite Eyes, may be used to mark calling routes or routes to nest/roost locations. All markers placed during this contract must be removed at the conclusion of the contract. GPS locations will be taken for each route and placed on the standard topographic maps described above.</p>
<p>If a MSO flies or appears to be located on private land, no attempts will be made to cross ownership boundaries. Contractor will show direction of flight on a map included in the final report, or estimate the location of the area a MSO appears to be located in.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to assure all persons conducting the monitoring work meet training and certification requirements. Proof of training and required Region 3 certification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer prior to award, for crew leaders and preferably all crewmembers. (Crewmembers certified after award of contract must show certification prior to initiation of fieldwork).</p>
<p>Monitoring information shall be documented on the MSO monitoring forms (attached).</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine local conditions affecting road access to each site. Notify the COR within 2 working days if weather caused road inaccessibility (on an open road) is delaying work.</p>

Take Trail xxA north 1.5 miles over the adjacent pass into BlankCanyon climbing and descending a total of 800 ft from the Trail xx/xxA junction. Although this route is somewhat shorter than the east entrance route, the elevation change along this route is much greater with a total change of 4000 ft. This route will take 5 hours to complete and should be considered DIFFICULT due to elevation change and elevation at start of route but is could be preferred because of the drive time to get to the eastern route start point. </strong></p>
<p><strong>PAC 030326 (North San Mateo Mtns.) Road access from Magdalena is HWY 60. Route begins at (Trail #xx). From this point at the center of the PAC, each side-drainage is easily accessed for daytime pre-calling surveys. This daytime calling route is approximately 3.3 miles round trip and covers 2400 ft elevation change through dense vegetation and closed canopy mixed conifer forest. This route was used for daytime pre-calling and nighttime surveys and considering the terrain and undergrowth, should be considered MODERATE during pre-calling daytime surveys and DIFFICULT for nighttime hiking.</strong></p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-51.
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541612. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, firm fixed price contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR and ORCA, please see their respective websites at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx and https://orca.bpn.gov/.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: </strong>The budget for this requirement is $50,000.00.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the Vice President for Finance and Administration of the University (VP for Finance and Administration) over the past five years.  USUHS wishes to employ the services of a nationally recognized professional with experience and expertise in finance, budgeting, planning and administration for an academic health center/medical school administration.</p>
<p>The University President established the requirement that each of the University's senior leadership would undergo a comprehensive performance assessment at the completion of their fifth year of service to the University. A comprehensive assessment for the VP for Finance and Administration has not been accomplished to date - only annual self-assessments. The requirement calls for a qualified outside contractor to lead a team of selected members from USUHS in completing  interviews and a comprehensive review of the VP of Finance and Administration's performance against the goals he established and were subsequently approved by the University President. There will be an administrative executive identified to work with the contractor selected and assist in coordinating the internal administrative support needed by the selected quote. The offeror is expected to develop a plan that will be reviewed by USUHS personnel prior to its execution. The outside contractor will then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the University President.</p>

<p>1.       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporate Experience</span> - Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their experience in performing past assessments of senior finance and administrative leadership of higher learning academic institutions. Any experience working with a medical school, graduate school of nursing, or federal and/or state government should be noted due to differences in appropriations when compared to the public sector.

<p>2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Approach</span> - Offeror's methodology for completing assessment. <br />Offerors shall describe their method(s) of assessment. If citing named methodologies, please include a description of what it entails and how the plan will be implemented.</p>

Offerors may provide additional information to support past performance history, but not in lieu of the past performance surveys required. USUHS reserves the right to contact customer references for additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a "neutral/unknown" rating for past performance. A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable past performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternate sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>4.       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price</span> - <strong>Offerors must provide a firm fixed price quote.</strong> The budget for this requirement id $50,000.00.

It is the responsibility of the offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All quotes and past performance surveys are due by 5:00 PM (EST) on June 10, 2011</span>.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quotes must be emailed to jody.bester@usuhs.mil</span>.</strong> The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0001:  The purpose of this amendment is to add the following language to the PWS:

1.	HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT of 1996 (HIPAA):  The Contractor shall adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance with HIPAA, the Contractor is required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA under this contract, see attached for a copy.
2.	CONTRACTOR PERSONNNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
a.	All Contractor employees are subject to the same level of investigation as VA employees who have access to VA Sensitive Information.  The level of background investigation commensurate with the level of access needed to perform the statement of work is:  a Special Agreement Check (SAC).  This requirement is applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same access.  The Contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations.  If the investigation is conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) through the VA, the Contractor shall reimburse the VA within 30 days.
b.	Within five business days of receiving the award notice, the Contractor shall submit a completed Background Investigation Request Worksheet, to be provided after award, that lists all Contractor employees that will be providing preceptorship and fax it to the Contracting Officer (CO), contact information to be provided after award.
c.	All Contractor employees providing preceptorship are required to be fingerprinted within 14 calendar days of the award notice, except for those who received an e-mail from the VA (Veterans Affairs) SIC (Security Investigation Center) confirming reciprocity.  Courtesy electronic fingerprints can be obtained at some VA facilities, including the Wilkes Barre Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will schedule a fingerprinting appointment at a VA facility as soon as possible.  Each Contractor employee shall take a copy of the VHA (Veterans Health Administration) SAC Memorandum, to be provided after award, to the fingerprinting appointment and complete it.  Contractor employees shall fax the completed form to the Contracting Officer, contact information to be provided after award.  The Office of Personnel Management sends the results of the SAC to the Veterans Service Center (VSC) Personnel Security Office within 5 days.  The VSC Personnel Security Office reviews the results and makes an adjudication recommendation to the CO within 10 days, who will inform the Contractor POC of the outcome.  Contractor employees will then be required to obtain a Personal Identification Verification (PIV) badge on-site at the VA, further instructions to be provided after award.

<DESC>This amendment provides a response to vendor request for clarification as follows:  <br>Inquiry - Request confirmation that courses would need to be specific to the Department of Defense Offie of the Inspector General and its employees.  <br>Government Response: Yes, courses would need to pertain specifically to the OIG community based on the following:  The Government (IG) requires a learning initiative as part of the OIG larger corporate strategy to systematically provide each member of the workforce with cost effective developmental opportunities.  This requires special and specific coursework to support the initiative.  A key goal of the OIG leadership is to improve professional staff development programs which build on previously identified core competencies in a cost effective manner.  The IGEL program is the OIG's venture into c-learning which is a recognized and sanctioned effort within the President's Management Agenda designed to improve the management of strategic human capital associated with these types of oversight agencies.  These courses and courseware have been tailored to the specific need of the IG community because of the specific oversight activities required in an effort to perform the IG mission. <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY .  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining industry comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a stewardship contract that will provide the services needed at the lowest possible cost or even negative cost to the Government in regard to the general requirement stated below.   The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. 


ProjectName:  
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) Project 

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Southwestern Region (AZ and NM) of the Forest Service intends to perform a  large, minimum, multi-year forest restoration project in central Arizona under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act.  The overall objective is to treat approximately 1 million acres of ponderosa pine forest types by thinning and harvesting mainly small diameter trees in excess of ecological requirements under a number of 10-year stewardship contracts.  This process could take up to 20 to 30 years as contracts are awarded presupposing that the Stewardship Contracting Authority is extended.  This would yield up to 8 to 10 million CCF (100 cubic feet) of wood fiber.  The rate of treatments under the first contract is anticipated to be a minimum of 30,000 acres per year over a ten-year contract period.  It is expected that most treatment areas would accommodate ground-based harvest systems with some temporary road construction requirements and minor amounts of specified road reconstruction.  Areas proposed for treatment are scattered across four forests  Tonto, Kaibab, Coconino, and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  

The purpose of this request is to begin to identify issues specific to an RFP with regards to the needs of the forest industry.  For example: 
1.	How would you structure existing industries to efficiently harvest and utilize the full spectrum of available raw material which includes biomass, roundwood, and sawlogs.
2.	How would you propose to structure partnerships with other businesses that would enable costs for treatment to be at or near zero?
3.	How long would your plant take to construct and how long after award would you anticipate the plant starting production?  
4.	After start up, assuming there is a gradual increase to full production, how long do you anticipate that you would need to be at full production? 
5.	How long after contract award would you need to start harvest and removal of logs or other forest residue?
6.	How much wood would you project for the first year after award, what amount in year two, etc?  
7.	What amount of wood do you project needing at full production?  
8.	Would you prefer the contract be with your company, and you would subcontract to the logging companies; or would you prefer a logging contractor be the primary contractor with a separate contract with your company?


There is no formal contract at present, the exact acres to be treated have not all been identified, and the exact amount of wood to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.  However, a supply assessment has determined that there is a large sustainable supply for up to 20 years projected, and the Forest Service is confident that the volumes will be substantial and firm.  From this information it is projected that there will be more contracts of comparable size in the future.  

THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS:

Now is the time to provide us with any critical comments or ideas related to this project.  If there is something that we need to consider in developing the RFP, which will help make this project a success for all of us, whether it has been specifically asked or not, please let us know.  Once we begin putting the RFP together, we must maintain a considerable degree of confidentiality.  

We plan to solicit proposals late in calendar year 2010 or early 2011 and award in early to mid calendar year 2012.     
Submission Requirements:  
So that we may better determine capabilities and requirements for this prospective procurement, we request that you submit  your answers to the questions above and any additional comments or concerns you may have by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on July 30, 2010, with the title of the project (Four Forest Restoration Initiative Stewardship Project or 4-FRI) in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. The preferred method of communication is by email.  Due to volume of contacts, phone calls will not be returned.  Please send your responses to Henry Provencio, 4-FRI Team Leader at hprovencio@fs.fed.us and Rufus KI Cole, Contracting Officer at rcole01@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Olympic National Forest intends to acquire by contract the repair of the Lake Cushman bridge approach on Forest Service Road (FSR) No. 2451 and installation of scour protection. The Olympic National Forest will issue a design-build construction Request for Proposals (RFP). Offerors will be evaluated on experience: designing and building retaining walls (H-Pile, Sheet Pile and/or mechanically stabilized); designing and building scour protection retaining walls; and working in and near sensitive aquatic habitat for dewatering and construction. Scour protection design shall consider the seasonal changing reservoir water elevations and associated changing river velocities. Design of the repair shall be completed by a Professional Engineer, with related experience and license in the State of Washington.
<p>The project is located at the Lake Cushman Reservoir west of Hoodsport, Washington. The Lake Cushman Bridge crosses the upper portion of the reservoir between rock and earth approach fills. Contractor shall remove a 50-foot temporary vehicular bridge spanning the failed approach fill and the permanent bridge. Approximately a dozen private cabins are within a &frac14; mile after crossing the temporary bridge. Contractor shall maintain pedestrian access by means of a temporary footbridge, or stairs with a handrail, during construction and maintain road closure signs, barriers, and an information sign posting any pedestrian delays.</p>
<p>Work on the project site will be permitted between August 15, 2011, and October 15, 2011. Work between August 15, 2011 and Sept. 10, 2011, will be limited since the reservoir water elevations will be higher and dewatering more difficult. The majority of the in-stream work will be performed between Sept. 10, 2011, and October 7, 2011, when the reservoir is at its planned lowest water elevation and when dewatering will be least difficult. Pile driving in the wetted perimeter of the reservoir shall be completed by Sept. 30, 2011. Work in the wetted perimeter of the reservoir after Sept 30, 2011, shall be part of the scheduled dewatering plan, meeting listed contract requirements, with all in-water work completing by October 7, 2011.</p>
<p>The Forest Service intends to release the solicitation on, or about, MAY 23, 2011. Offerors shall submit Phase 1 information including design-build team members experience on similar projects and references by May 27, 2011. Up to 3 contractors will be selected for Phase II. Selected contractors will submit a Phase II proposal including: proposed performance schedule; proposed conceptual design; and price by June 24, 2011. Award is expected by June 30, 2011. The successful offeror will complete a final design including any shop drawings by July 30, 2011, and complete construction within the timelines above.</p>
<p>Technical Contacts: Shannon Henriquez 360-956-2264; and Kathy Van Hecke 503-808-2829</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range: $500,000 to $750,000</p>
<p>The government will proceed to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation. 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p>A bid guarantee, performance bond and payment bond are required. Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to any resulting contract. The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//. For additional information contact Miley Sutherland, Contracting Officer at 360-956-2471.</p>

<a href="mailto:stuart.burman@navy.mil">stuart.burman@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) is seeking information on commercially available Underwater Breathing Apparatuses (UBA).  The UBA will be used by Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) detachments when performing mine countermeasures, neutralization of ordnance, or recovery of high value equipment located underwater.  The UBA will need to have the following characteristics:  be non-magnetic and able to meet contact specifications per MIL-DTL-19595D, a Mean Time Between Operational Mission Failures (MTBOMF) of at least 90 hours, a Mean Corrective Maintenance Time for Operational Mission Failures (MCMTOMF) of no more than 1.5 hours, an Operational Availability (Ao) defined as uptime divided by uptime plus downtime of 0.85 or higher, a life supporting oxygen mix throughout the dive, a duration of 299 minutes with 30 min at 36 lpm (liters per minute) Respiratory Minute Volume (RMV) and 269 min at 22 lpm RMV, ability to indicate the UBA status to the diver, an integral buoyancy compensator, a breathing resistance not to exceed 2.04 J/l at 150 fsw (45.7 msw) using a breathable nitrogen based diluent, or 2.4 J/l at 300 fsw (91.4 msw) using a breathable HeO2 based diluent.
  Operational temperature range in air will be 0 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (-17.8 degrees Celsius (C)) to 130 F (54.4 C) and in water will be 29 F (-1.67 C) to 105 F (40.6 C).  Storage temperature range will be -24 F (-31.1 C) to 130 F (54.4 C).  The UBA should be capable of using both a mouthpiece and a full face mask.  System hardware and software should be easily maintained and upgradeable as new technology becomes available.  Desirable features would be the ability to calibrate the UBA in the field, ability to bench dive the UBA, a pre-mission setup time of 30 minutes or less, ability to diagnose problems with the UBA quickly, ability to record the dive profile and transfer UBA data to a portable computer, voice communications between divers and between divers and the surface, and ability to use different carbon dioxide absorbent materials common to NATO.
  The UBA should be lightweight in its ready to dive configuration and be similar in size or smaller than the current Mk16 (approximately 23.6 x 14.9 x 10.5 inches).  

Respond with the following documentation:  (1) technical literature with complete description and specifications showing the ability to meet the Underwater Breathing Apparatus characteristics; (2) estimated unit cost information for a quantity of 100, 200, and 300 units; and (3) estimated preventative maintenance cost for 1 year and 2 year periods to include replacement part costs, o-rings, gaskets, screws, etc. and an estimation of time to perform the preventative maintenance.  

The technical point of contact for this action is Terry Adams, terence.adams@navy.mil, NSWC PCD, Code E15.
  Forward requested documentation to:  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, Terry Adams, 110 Vernon Avenue, Code E15, Panama City, FL 32407 7001.  Questions of a general or contractual nature should be directed to Stuart Burman, Contract Specialist, stuart.burman@navy.mil, NSWC PCD, Code B32.

This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for the assessment of potential risks, benefits, costs, economic impacts and other effects associated with the generation and management of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste. The EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able to provide the technical and analytical services to support the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Economics and Risk Analysis Staff (ERAS) of the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR).</p>
<p>The EPA manages a broad-scale program designed to ensure that hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste does not pose unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. Within EPA, the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) is responsible for overseeing a variety of regulatory and non regulatory activities focused on achieving and maintaining solid waste management safety goals, as established under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. These goals are updated and refined under the Agency's recently released strategic plan: "2003-2008 EPA Strategic Plan: Direction for the Future," and OSW's (OSW changed its name to ORCR in 2009) "Office of Solid Waste Strategic Planning Document: 2003-2008." The legal authority for the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery to perform work pertaining to these activities, as required under this contract, is established under the Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976.</p>
<p><br />The mission of the ORCR is to encourage land-based practices that help ensure economic and environmental sustainability, safe materials/waste management, and ongoing waste reduction. ORCR's three primary Goals are: to promote the conservation of natural resources, to help prevent future contamination problems, and to clean-up existing contamination problems that have resulted from past practices. The technical support requirements are designed to help ORCR meet resource conservation, protection, and corrective action (clean-up) goals. Requirements for this contract cover <br />&bull; Data and information collection, analysis, and management <br />&bull; Development of methodologies and analytical models for analyzing the costs, benefits, economic impacts, cost-effectiveness, and other impacts of waste-related regulations, policies, and voluntary programs. <br />&bull; The identification and assessment of environmental indicators and performance measures, as well as analyses of policy options.<br />&bull; Ecological and human health risk analyses of waste handling practices and problems relevant to RCRA-managed wastes and other related environmental issues<br />&bull; Technical support for document preparation and revisions</p>

<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:</p>
<p>To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft PWS.</p>
<p>All capability statements must:</p>
<p>1. Not exceed and will be restricted up to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.<br />2. Shall be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.<br />3. Include small business classification(s): (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.) <br />4.

State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (d) a description of the concern's accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts-and whether or not those system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.<br />7. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive capability statements when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION<br />Please submit all Capability Statements by 4:00 P.M. EST on December 15, 2010 via email to:<br />Christie Deskiewicz, Contract Specialist at deskiewicz.christie@epa.gov.</p>

<a href="mailto:amy.aguirre@smdc.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Forces Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is seeking potential sources interested in and capable of performing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Space Superiority in a classified Top Secret SCI environment.  The primary task is to develop a mobile, ground-based, tactically-centric space information superiority capability to meet joint requirements and validated U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) capability gaps.  The system would maximize Commercial and Government off-the-shelf (COTS and GOTS) hardware and use Modular and Open System Approach architecture to enhance future upgrades to meet emerging/changing space capabilities. System mobility, using military tactical vehicles, will enable the system to move and maintain space superiority in support of Brigade tactical operations.  The potential development contract may include completion of a preliminary design over an eighteen to twenty-four month period while building two Production Representative Systems that will be used in developmental and operational testing. The proposed effort may also include options for follow-on low density production (3-15 total systems) completed over an additional eighteen month Production cycle.  Although no formal solicitation exists at this time, it is anticipated that the resulting request for proposals will be approved and issued as a Small Business Set Aside and USASMDC/ARSTRAT is issuing this Special Notice to gain additional awareness of interest, capabilities and qualifications of all Small Business entities that can support this requirement as a prime contractor.  Teaming is encouraged.  All small business teams capable of providing the requirements as outlined in this Special Notice are invited to respond and participate.<br><br>Potential offerors will be required to have a current TS SCI facility, as well as personnel with current TS clearance that are SCI approved, for contract performance.  The classified information dissemination meeting/industry day is postponed until further notice (this meeting will be an opportunity to review the DRAFT request for proposal package).  While postponed, it is anticipated that the future industry day conference will be limited to three persons per small business, or six persons per small business team.  Personnel attending the meeting must have a current TS clearance with SCI eligibility.<br><br>A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  Contract type has not yet been determined.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code that adequately describes the majority of the work is 334220 Space Satellites, Communications, Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 750 Employees.  In accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS), all potential offerors are reminded that Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required.  Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.<br><br>No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  Interested parties must respond to this notice to be considered for future solicitations associated with this effort.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this event is voluntary and will not be returned.  No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or Government use of such information.  The information obtained from industry to this event may be used in the development of the acquisition strategy and future requests for proposal.  As appropriate, a list of industry day conference attendees will be published to attendees to facilitate teaming arrangements.<br><br>All questions or inquiries should be submitted, in writing or electronic mail, to the Government point of contact. <br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Amy Aguirre, Contracting Officer<br>Comm: (256) 955-1254, Amy.Aguirre@smdc.army.mil <br>Contracting Office Address: <br>US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander, ATTN SMDC-CM-AP, P.O.

<DESC>The following amendment is issued to provide answers to industry questions.

Q 1.  Do we need to address the 'targeting' function of a deployment system?

A 1.  The human in the loop is responsible for targeting.  The system will be point and shoot just like a shot gun or rifle.

Q 2.  Does our deployment system just need to get the launch canister to the point of engagement or does it also need to deploy/disperse the entanglement net?

A 2.  The system needs to deploy/disperse the entanglement device in the engagement configuration.  The engagement configuration is the entanglement device floating in the water expanded to its full length.

Q 3.  If it is to disperse the net, when should it initiate?  Before it hits the water?  After submerging a specified depth?  What is the desired CONOPS?

A 3.
  The entanglement device needs to land in the fully deployed state.

Q 4.  Assuming the RFI results in an RFP:

   a. When will the RFP be issued?

   b. Estimated number of contracts?

   c. Estimated contract amount, program duration, and TRL entering/exiting contract?

A  4.  Not known at this time.

Q  5.  Will this solicitation be coordinated with other agencies, such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center or Naval Undersea Warfare Center, etc?

A  5.  Information obtained from this RFI may be shared with other DoD activities.

<AWARDEE>RAYTHEON BBN TECHNOLOGIES CORP. 10 MOULTON ST CAMBRIDGE, MA  02138-1119
<DESC>Raytheon BBN teams Adaptive, Efficient, Trusted, Hardened Environmentally Robust(AETHER) Network provides a unique forward-looking approach to the creation of aninnovative F6 Information Architecture.  Raytheons BBN team proposes a lightweightpublish-subscribe-query (PSQ) architecture that exploits the limitations of the F6environment (limited bandwidth and limited spaced-based storage). The result is anarchitecture that is radically clean with unprecedented ease of verification andvalidation (V&V), operations, maintenance, reliability, robustness, and future proofingyet is fully open source and ITAR free. The central concept of fractionated satellitesystems is that rather than launching a monolithic spacecraft, maximally packed withresources, we should launch a cluster of smaller satellites (modules), in which eachmodule carries few resources, and the modules share these resources over a wirelessnetwork to replicate and extend the services of a monolithic platform. The advantages ofa fractionated architecture include the ability to replace and enhance modules as well asto add new capabilities to the cluster.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to continue its use of standard vocabulary in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) implementation specifications under development for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) data from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Phase IV of the CDA for HAI reporting project extends technical guidance for reporting HAIs, previously developed in Phase III of the project, to a new set of reporting requirements. These reporting requirements include vocabulary needed to convey HAI data in accordance with (1) NHSN specifications, (2) healthcare informatics and information technology standards, and (3) Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) requirements.
<p><br />Our current contract with Latana Consulting Group (former Alschuler Associates) covers Phase IV and provides for the maintenance needed to insure that all work products developed for HAI I - IIII are kept up-to-date with the programs evolving requirements for collecting HAI data using NHSN. Thus, modifications to forms and files updates needed to convey HAI data in accordance with (1) NHSN specifications, (2) healthcare informatics and information technology standards, and (3) Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) requirements.</p>
<p>Lantana Consulting Group's unique qualifications include its contributions to the rapidly maturing CDA standard for health data exchanges; direct involvement in Health Level Seven (HL7) Structured Documents Technical Committee (SDTC); being a HL7 board member; and extensive experience developing and advising federal agencies on the use of HL7 STDC specifications for Clinical Document Architecture (CDA).</p>
<p>Based on the above, we believe that no other source, but Lantana Consulting Group in East Thetford, VT can realistically meet our needs. Therefore, a modification to existing contract No. 200-2010-33893 to add this work is contemplated. The period of performance for this work is May 13, 2011 to July 11, 2011.</p>
