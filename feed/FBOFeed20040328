6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (renewable) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:		USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Tashkent, Uzbekistan
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from 150 years of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particularly difficult challenge for USAID.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post – 25% post differential for Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 

USAID’s Regional Mission for Central Asia (“USAID/CAR”) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and the management of USAID assistance programs.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and conflict mitigation, as well as health and education.  The Mission works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractors throughout the region.  The Uzbekistan Country Office (USAID/CAR/UCO) in Tashkent, led by the Country Office Director, includes a team of 2 USDH, 2 USPSCs, and 17 local national technical and administrative support staff.   

B)	Basic Function 

The USPSC Democracy Specialist is located in the USAID/CAR/Tashkent office. Under the dual supervision of the USAID/CAR/UCO Director and the Democracy & Conflict Mitigation (DM) Director, the employee serves as an activity manager for democracy programs implemented in Uzbekistan. The Democracy Specialist is also expected to act as the Deputy Country Office Director, providing technical expertise and management assistance to the UCO Director as necessary.  The work of the Democracy Specialist involves a full range of project design, activity monitoring, grant management, data collection, political analysis, and program evaluation in the democracy sector in Uzbekistan.

The Democracy Specialist is responsible for monitoring USAID/CAR/Uzbekistan initiatives in the democracy sector. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of political developments in the region, a background in democracy and community development programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with American NGOs, local non-governmental partners and government officials in Uzbekistan.  Moreover, s/he will work closely with and coordinate USAID/CAR’s democracy programs with the U.S. Embassy and other USG funded activities such as those funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Bureau (DRL).  

Due to the nature of this position, the Democracy Specialist must be able to think and operate strategically and programmatically, analyze complex situations in order to assist in the development of USAID strategic plans, and assess the impact of host country policies and practices on USAID programs.  While this position is based in Tashkent, the Democracy Specialist is expected to travel to program sites throughout Uzbekistan on a frequent basis.  S/he should spend at least one-third of her/his time traveling throughout Uzbekistan.  

C) 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

Under the guidance of the USAID/CAR/UCO Director and technical supervision of the DM Director, the Democracy Specialist monitors and reports on the progress of media assistance, civic advocacy, rule of law, and political process activities, which are underway in Uzbekistan.  S/he identifies barriers to program implementation and success, and develops solutions to maximize program impact.  The Democracy Specialist will work collaboratively with the Democracy and Conflict Mitigation technical staff in Almaty to ensure program activities are implemented effectively.  This individual is expected to track and analyze political issues crucial for the successful implementation of democracy activities in Uzbekistan.  The Democracy Specialist provides strategic vision for the democracy program in Uzbekistan, continually honing USAID’s strategy and approach to ensure the democracy and media program is appropriate given local conditions, developments and opportunities.  

Based on thorough understanding and analysis of democratic developments in Uzbekistan, the Democracy Specialist suggests new and/or changes to existing programs and activities.  S/he may develop program goals and objectives, and prepare scopes of work for new activities, project assessments, and/or evaluations in Uzbekistan.

S/he drafts success stories, reporting cables and other informational documents to publicize USAID’s democracy and media assistance in Uzbekistan.  Additionally, the Democracy Specialist serves as site officer, develops potential site visits, prepares briefing documents for, and briefs high level visitors such as Congressional Delegations, State Department and USAID Representatives, on USAID/CAR’s democracy activities in Uzbekistan. 

The Democracy Specialist is expected to report, along with the UCO Director, on the performance of USAID/CAR democracy activities to Embassy officials.  S/he serves as USAID/CAR representative on U.S. Embassy Democracy Commission and coordinates USAID/CAR’s democracy activities with other U.S. Government agencies, especially the Public Affairs Section of the Embassy and the State Department’s Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Bureau (DRL).

Within the framework of general guidelines, as arrived at through policy discussions with superiors, the Democracy Specialist conducts meetings with government counterparts in Uzbekistan regarding the design, development, and implementation of democracy/ community development activities in order to explain and resolve differences of opinion or approaches.

Consistent with the overall Mission strategy, the incumbent independently cultivates/ maintains contacts and dialogue with local counterparts including non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Uzbekistan. These contacts and dialogues will be used by the employee to effectively provide input for programming democracy assistance. However, the incumbent will have no independent authority to commit the U.S. Government Mission funds on behalf of USAID/CAR/Almaty or USAID/CAR/Uzbekistan Country Office.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  The technical quote will be more significant then the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors should also discuss whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1 Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract, with delivery 30 days ARO.
