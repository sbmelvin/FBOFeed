<SOLNBR>9594-05-R-0002
<ARCHDATE>01302005
<CONTACT>Elizabeth Moya, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 202-220-5407, Fax 202-220-5711, Email elizabeth.moya@csosa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is for miscellaneous construction support services for Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), primarily for minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, typically for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  The government intends on awarding one, or more, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) to eligible 8(a) firm(s) through a competitive source selection process.  The competition will be restricted to eligible 8 (a) firms currently maintaining a bona fide branch office in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Area (DC, VA, MD, WV).  A bona fide branch office is a place where an 8(a) participant regularly maintains a construction management office employing at least one full-time individual within the DC Metropolitan Area geographic boundary.  The successful 8(a) participant(s) will be selected using a best value approach, with past performance (in particular, demonstrated ability to meet performance schedules) being more important than price.  Price will be evaluated based on a real, or simulated, construction project.  (The government reserves the right to independently obtain past performance information after receipt of proposals.)

The task order-specific Scopes of Work for the non-commercial construction services under the IDIQ may be comprised of performance-based, design-build, or a combination thereof.  (Any design work will be incidental in comparison to the construction requirements for all projects.)  Individual task order requirements will be negotiated on a firm-fixed price basis using the R.S. Means “Square Foot Costs book” (for 2005) as the common negotiation tool.  Projects will occur in various physical spaces occupied by CSOSA throughout the District of Columbia.  Task Orders issued after award will consist of a broad range of minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, primarily for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  Work will include tasks in a variety of trades such as carpentry, painting, installation services, plumbing, painting, masonry, welding, HVAC, electrical distribution, etc.  The contractor shall furnish all materials, labor, plant, tools, transportation, equipment, testing services insurance  and quality control and incidentals necessary to meet the task order-specific Scope of Work (SOW).  All work shall be performed in accordance with the technical standards of the basic IDIQ, and the task-order specific SOW.  The typical range of required construction services includes mechanical, electrical, and plumbing skills as well as experience with commercial painting and flooring treatments.  

The estimated period of performance shall be a base year, with four one-year option periods.  The anticipated dollar value is an estimated $250,000 for the base year and for each of the one-year option periods, with a total estimated contract value of $1,250,000.  This amount may be reduced if multiple (not more than two (2)) contracts are awarded.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the amount of work to be ordered, however, a minimum amount of $25,000 is guaranteed for each performance year, for each contract awarded.  The minimum guaranteed funding amount will be reduced by the issuance of task orders during the period of performance.  Individual task orders will typically range from $2,500 to $25,000.  Contract award(s) will not preclude CSOSA from acquiring construction services through other acquisition methods during the life of the contract(s).  The primary NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $28.5MIL.

It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 14 January  2005 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http:// www. eps. gov    The solicitation will contain the mandatory response time and submittal requirements.  Paper copies will not be made available.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon interested parties to review this web site frequently for any updates / amendments to any and all documents.  No telephone requests for this solicitation will be accepted.  Firms are reminded registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http:// www. ccr. gov is mandatory.  This acquisition is set-aside for firms certified for participation in the 8(a) Program serviced by the Washington Metropolitan Area District of the 8 (a) Business Development Program.

The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, is seeking a vendor to provide the EPICS software for the Adaptive Optics Slow FOcus Sensor (AO SFO) System, which will be implemented on both the Gemini North and Gemini South Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics systems. Each Adaptive Optics Slow Focus Sensor System will consist of a digital camera, readout electronics, computer hardware and software and will measure and compute the absolute focus error on a natural guide star; the focus information derived from a laser guide star being not reliable due to the varying altitude of the sodium layer. The sensor has been selected (Apogee Alta E57+) and will be provided to the Vendor by AURA. The software will be installed into a PC based computer provided by AURA which runs Linux and EPICS.  The full requirements for this procurement, and instructions for submitting a proposal, will be given in a Request for Proposal to be released in the near future.  Firms that are interested in receiving this Request for Proposal should email a letter of interest to Andrew Flach at aflach@gemini.edu by no later than Thursday 9 December 2004.

<SUBJECT>70 -- High Performance Computing System for NOAA's R&D Requirements
<SOLNBR>NOAA-RandDHPCS
<RESPDATE>030405
<ARCHDATE>03192005
<CONTACT>William Voitk, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-3525 x196, Fax (301) 713-4040, Email william.voitk@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire an advanced  high performance computer system(s) (HPCS) to meet its research and development (R&D) computing requirements.  This system(s) is necessary to support NOAA's continued advances in environmental modeling capabilities and to meet other high performance computing requirements that may arise within NOAA and at other partner agencies.  The Government requires a single contractor to be responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and support of the HPCS that will advance NOAA Research and Development (R&D) programs.  The primary acquisition goal is to acquire balanced, comprehensive computing capabilities configured from commercially-available items including processors, storage, software, support, and maintenance services that will allow NOAA to meet its increasing processing requirements.   

The new HPCS will replace or augment the current R&D HPCS platforms of NOAA's Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) in Boulder, Colorado; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, New Jersey; and the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) located in Camp Springs, Maryland.  The replacement system(s) will be known as the NOAA R&D HPCS and will provide a primary resource needed to carry out NOAA's research mission.

The system life for the HPCS is projected to be eight years (FY2006-FY2013).  The contract will be divided into a four-year base period (FY2006-FY2009), followed by a four-year option period (FY2010-2013).  During the base period, the contract will be renewed each year subject to the availability of funds.  The decision to exercise the option period, will be made by evaluating a proposal, submitted by the incumbent contractor during FY2008.  The HPCS proposed for the option period must offer a guaranteed increase in computational performance over the previously delivered system(s).  If the option period is exercised, the contract will be renewed each of the following years in the option period, subject to the availability of funds.  Also included in the contract will be an option for the Government to extend the base contract period for an additional year.  The intent of this one-year option is to provide the Government with sufficient time to complete a competitive follow-on acquisition should the four-year option contract period not be exercised.  A similar one-year option will be included in the contract to extend the option contract period to permit transition to a follow-on contractor should it be necessary.  The total period of the contract could be as long as nine years.  

The contract will include two indefinite quantity options. The first indefinite quantity option provides a capability to acquire additional HPCS augmentations.  These additional augmentations could be used to satisfy unanticipated NOAA requirements or requirements from a partnering agency, and will be established as fixed-price.  The second indefinite quantity option will provide engineering support (e.g., applications analyst, systems/network/security engineer, and facilities engineer) on a labor-hour basis. These two options may be exercised at any time during the contract life.  

The total estimated ceiling amount of this acquisition, inclusive of all options, and based upon maximum quantities for the indefinite quantity options, is $368 million.  An annual project funding profile for the system life, inclusive of all options, will be provided in the Request fro Proposal.  

Offerors may propose any method of acquisition or financing arrangement with the knowledge that the Government prefers a lease arrangement.  The Government does not desire to own the system at the conclusion of the system life, with the exception of the hierarchical storage management system(s) which will be purchased by the Government during the contract life.  Proposal of acquisition alternatives should be consistent with the funding profile cited in the RFP.  

The Government anticipates awarding a contract in September 2005 with initial system installation commencing in the fall of 2005.  A milestone schedule and related information (e.g., draft RFP Sections, Project Agreement, RFI, etc.) for this acquisition can be found at http://rdhpcs.noaa.gov/.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via the Internet at the same web site.  Please monitor this website for release of the RFP.  Printed copies of the RFP will not be provided unless specifically requested in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Companies that responded to a previous synopsis for Request for Information (RFI) appearing in the September 1, 2004, issue of Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) will be notified by e-mail message of the RFP's release.

The Contractor will also ensure that the cross-cutting themes of gender, youth, and ethnicity, included in USAID Kosovo’s strategy and Diversity Action Plan, are incorporated throughout the project in an effort to sensitize the media to the special issues of different segments of the population and assist in building greater tolerance of diversity. 

The planned contract type is a cost plus fixed fee completion type. The contract period is three years. The RFP is expected to be issued on or about December 17, 2004, and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  It will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on the website along with the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Mahajanga Barge-Lightering in Madagascar.

The second largest port in Madagascar, Mahajanga experiences significant operational and infrastructure problems caused primarily by a silted estuary that limits ship capacity.   This U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)-funded study would consider an alternative approach:  an offshore unloading system for bulk cargo using tugs and large barges and requiring little or no dredging.  Efficiencies would be gained through the use of larger craft towed by tugs on which to load cargo from oceangoing vessels.  The larger barges, equipped with appropriate gear, could be loaded much more rapidly and safely than the small vessels currently in use -- each barge would receive five to seven times more cargo than the typical coastal vessel.  

The Terms of Reference will require the consultant to assess the feasibility of a barge unloading and regional transportation system at Mahajanga by undertaking the following summarized tasks:

v	Current situation review:
§	Regional vessel voyage cost modeling
§	Port and inland transport systems analysis
§	Commodity demand forecast

v	Mahajanga barge lightering system:
§	Concept definition
§	Wind and wave, vessel interaction and modeling
§	Tug and barge requirements definition
§	Barge terminal concept design
§	Comparative cost analysis

v	Regional tug and barge transport system:
§	Concept definition
§	Wind and wave, vessel interaction and modeling
§	Tug and barge terminals concept design
§	Regional barge terminals concept design
§	Comparative cost analysis
§	Project assessment and report

v	Preliminary Environmental Impact Analysis

v	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $374,250 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, January 21, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Regional Procurement Support Office, Frankfurt, Germany, intends to issue a solicitation for the design, construction, maintenance and site support of a facility to house approximately two hundred people in Kabul, Afghanistan.  The facility will be established for the use and occupancy by a law enforcement interdiction force within the Counter Narcotics Police–Afghanistan (CNPA) composed of both Afghans and US personnel.  Design, construction, maintenance and site support costs are estimated to exceed $10,000,000.  In accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act, award will be limited to a U.S. firm.


A location for the site has been identified and will be provided by the Government.  The location has several existing buildings which will require refurbishment to meet US standards.  To fully service 200 personnel, the site will also require modular type structures.  While not fully inclusive, the following units will be needed: a U.S. Kitchen and Dining facility, dormitories for U.S. and Afghan personnel, classrooms, recreation facilities, commercial laundry facility, power generation, sewerage treatment, water holding tanks, fuel tanks, an armory, an evidence storage facility, a vehicle inspection site, a gymnasium, a parade ground and a firing range.  Some of these units are planned to be provided by the Government.  A Satellite Earth Station will be required to allow for communications. 

A phased approached to the construction of the facility will be required to provide for occupancy of limited numbers of staff as soon as possible.  Potential contractors shall be in possession of all required permits and licenses to perform general construction work in Afghanistan.  All locally required permits and construction approvals shall be obtained by the contractor.  All communication, correspondence, and documentation must be in English.  Travel to Kabul is at the expense of the bidder. There is no provision for reimbursement of proposal costs.

Issuance of the subject solicitation is planned for Mid December 2004.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit is planned to be held in mid January 2005.  Contract award is planned in early February.  

Award of the contract will be to the technically acceptable, responsible offeror with the lowest evaluated price.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO INFORM PROSPECTIVE DEVELOPERS THAT THE SCOTT AFB IL MFH PRIVATIZATION PROJECT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) WILL BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT 3 DEC 2005.  THE INDUSTRY FORUM HAS ALREADY BEEN HELD.  Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) and the Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) is pleased to announce the release of the Air Force Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Scott AFB, Illinois. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time 11 January 2005, at the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle.  The Air Force intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to Scott AFB project.  The Air Force will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Scott AFB project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  The Air Force will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and select a Successful Offeror (SO) on the basis of the most advantageous proposal to the Air Force.  The Scott AFB Project will be initiated with a real estate transaction.  The objective of the transaction is to provide quality homes for Military Families and management for a 1,593 unit housing community for a period of at least 50 years.  The existing 1,430 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey to the SO.  The Government will lease its land. The SO will be responsible for providing additional new land to satisfy the requirements of the RFP.  The Government may provide the SO a loan, secured by a second mortgage, for a portion of the project’s development costs. The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Scott AFB family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

Specifially, the goal of the SPEYES program in 2005 is to achieve a four-fold force-multiplying improvement in three daily-occurring and manpower-intensive SASO missions: Fixed Site Security, Daily Patrols, and Cordon and Search.  Additional details regarding the SPEYES research goals will be provided at the BTI.  The BTI is scheduled for 8 December 2004 and will be held at Schafer Corporation, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington VA.  Information on the SPEYES BTI may be found at: http://www.schafertmd.com/speyes_bti/. Pre-registration for the SPEYES BTI is mandatory, as seating is limited to a maximum of 40 people.

Please note that in the event of a  conflict between what is said in the Questions and Answers and what is written  in the solicitation, the solicitation takes precedence.  If a conflict does  exist and an offeror requires clarification, please contact one of the  contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.

The documents are now in the  proper order and several "Draft" notations have been removed.  No other changes  have been made to the document.  Please note that this is a huge file, and may  not open in your browser window in a timely manner.  You may need to save the  file to your computer prior to reviewing the documentation. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-30-04) FINAL RFP RELEASE The final RFP is hereby released.  Please note Section L was accidently  duplicated and there are two identical file copies.  In addition, the document  sections, most notably, the PCO letters, are out of order due to software  glitches. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-05-04) SECTION L AND M, CLINs and SECTION H POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the Sections L, M, and H and the  CLINs and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at  your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 11 Nov 2004.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.

Subject: 	Request for Proposals (RFP) M/OAA/GH/POP-05-001 
		Supply Chain Management System for the President’s
		Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief

Dear Sir/Madame:

The U.S. Agency for International Development is seeking a proposal from your organization to provide the Services described in the attached pages.  It is anticipated that a single award five-year Indefinite Quantity Contract will be awarded for the services specified herein.  Task Order No. 1, a Level of Effort Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, shall also be awarded to the successful offeror.

Your proposals must be received by USAID no later than the closing date indicated above at the address indicated in Section L of the attached RFP.

The proposal shall be prepared in two separate parts:  one part (Technical Proposal) shall address technical aspects only; the second part (Business Management Proposal/Cost) should present your cost to do the work.  An original and six (6) copies of the technical proposal and original and four (4) copies of the Business Management Proposal should be submitted in sealed envelopes which are clearly marked as being in response to this RFP. 

Your proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization.  Fax proposals will not be accepted.  

Please pay careful attention, and complete, in full, Section K - Representations, Certifications, and Acknowledgements, Section L - Instructions to Offerors and Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award.

 
Because the potential $7 billion ceiling of this RFP has attracted attention and media comment, offerors are cautioned as follows:
- While USAID reserves right to make more than one award, currently a single award ICQ is contemplated.  For that reason, USAID has made a Justification and Determination, which is posted with this solicitation for all offerors’ notice.
- The IQC contract type requires payment by USAID only of a guaranteed minimum. The guaranteed minimum amount for this contract is $2.5 million, not $7 Billion.
- While USAID anticipates rapid growth of demand for use of the SCMS, the Statement of Objectives for the SCMS is primarily for a relatively modest central management and technical support component, plus a potentially substantial (the majority of the $7 billion ceiling) “amount” of USG funding for procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and delivery.  
- Offerors will not receive fee on the cost of commodities.
- Issuance of this solicitation does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation or submission of a proposal.

Questions regarding the RFP must be received by December 17, 2004.
Any inquiries concerning the RFP should be directed to Ms. Deborah Simms-Brown, dsimms@usaid.gov or the undersigned, lbilder@usaid.gov or by telefax, 202-216-3396.

Sincerely,
Lisa M. Bilder

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has an annual size standard of six million dollars.  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition.

PROJECT TITLE: "South Africa Air Quality Management and Strategic Planning Program Development."  The audience for this course is the Republic of South Africa's Department of Environment and Tourism (DEAT).  BACKGROUND:  The South African Department of Environmental  Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) has proposed an Air Quality Management Bill to introduce a comprehensive air quality management regime to the country.  The Bill currently is being considered by Parliament.  The Bill would supercede the current air law, the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1965,  which focuses primarily on the control of  industrial air emissions.   This revised Bill covers a broad range of air quality management programs, from ambient air standards to climate change and enforcement issues.  The Bill also describes the roles and responsibilities of the different government  entities involved, from the DEAT to municipal governments.  Given the broadened responsibilities  of the Bill, DEAT approached the U.S. Agency for International Development Office in Pretoria (USAID-Pretoria) to request the assistance of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in building  DEAT=s climate change and air quality management capacity to support successful implementation of the Bill. Based on a 2003 study tour, the US EPA made several recommendations to DEAT about the level and types of assistance we might provide.  These recommendations include: the provision of  technical training; the development of a council of academic advisors to promote institutionalization of training programs; sharing U.S. emission standards and regulations; and on-site assistance by a senior level EPA staff person. DEAT is faced with the challenge of trying to leap-frog from a  1960's control program to a modern air quality management (AQM) program.  In addition, they are faced with myriad issues that arise in a Federal system when administering such a program.  The EPA has had several decades of experience with AQM in a Federal setting.  The draft Bill provides DEAT with  two years to develop a national framework for achieving the objectives outlined in the Bill.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to develop a 4 day long Air Quality Management Train the Trainer course covering the major aspects of air quality management  to assist DEAT with a strategic  planning process and enable them to meet the above deadline.  For each course topic, DEAT will outline the next steps for how that topic will be addressed to build such a national framework.  The audience for this course will be no more than 50 total attendees comprised of staff from  the Republic  of South Africa's Department of Environment and Tourism (DEAT), as well as selected other personnel from governmental and non-governmental organizations in South Africa.  In the context of this course, the contract shall also conduct for DEAT a strategic planning session to allow them to leave the  course with a plan for the next steps to implement air quality management in South Africa. OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this contract is for the Contractor to deliver an effective 4 day long train-the-trainer air quality management overview course; leave DEAT with course materials for their future  training activities; assist DEAT to develop a strategic plan for implementing their air quality management program; improve global air quality and reduce associated health risk.  SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  TASK 1:  Development of the Draft Air Quality  Management Training Course -  The Contractor shall review current available resources. The Project Officer shall make available to the Contractor, existing documents and other relevant materials, which shall form the basis for the Course.  Examples of such documents include the existing Air  Pollution Training Institute courses such as Principles and Practices of Air Pollution Control, the web-based Introduction to Air Pollution Control, Basic Concepts in Environmental Sciences, Introduction to Risk Assessment, Basic Air Pollution Meteorology, & the Introduction to Permitting.  These  documents are available from the EPA Air Pollution Training Institute at  http://www.epa.gov/air/oaqps/eog/course_listing.html .  Draft Course Development - While much of the course content will be pulled from existing EPA materials, this existing material focuses heavily on U.S. strategies and  requirements.  As a result, subject matter expertise is required and the Contractor shall be responsible for compiling the best pieces of the content and put that content in an international context.   The Course shall be no more than 4 days in length.  The following topics shall be covered: human  health and environmental effects of air pollution; transport and dispersion of air pollution; air quality management; ambient monitoring of criteria air pollutants; data analysis and interpretation, public reporting, measurement and control of emissions; pollution prevention; laws and regulation  development; control strategy development; sources of air pollutants; emission inventories; compliance and enforcement; public participation; and environmental justice.  The contractor shall recommend non-EPA content that may enhance overall effectiveness of the training.   In addition, the course  shall be designed to accomplish a preliminary strategic planning process for the South African Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.  As noted in the Background, DEAT must develop a national framework for achieving the objectives of the Air Quality Bill.  The contractor shall develop a  process whereby DEAT can conduct a preliminary strategic planning effort as a prelude to developing a final national framework.  For each topic listed above, the course attendees shall be given time to plan for how that topic fits into the national framework, and identify the next steps for  implementing that aspect of their air quality management program. The contractor shall provide monthly teleconference updates on the progress of the course development to the Project Officer.  This shall include a draft outline of the course content.  The Project Officer will coordinate with DEAT,  and EPA=s Office of International Affairs to determine the most adequate level of detail and the progression of course materials. The contractor shall deliver a draft instructor=s manual, student manual, and a compact disc with relevant resources.  Documents may be in pdf or Microsoft Word format.  TASK 2: Finalize Course Content -  The contractor shall provide electronic versions of the course materials to be printed and copied by EPA for course delivery in the formats described above.  The final formatting and editing will be done by the contractor and delivered "printer-ready" to EPA.   Based on the feedback and consultation with the Project Officer, the contractor shall deliver final electronic documents for the Air Quality Management Course.  This will include the final instructor's manual, student manuals and resource CD. The contractor shall also deliver a final plan for  integrating the AQM Course training delivery with a strategic planning program. TASK 3: On-Site Course Delivery - The contractor, along with the Project Officer and two EPA staff members will deliver the AQM course and strategic planning program on-site in South Africa.  The EPA staff in  attendance will be air quality management generalists from the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and the EPA's Office of International Affairs.  USAID-Pretoria and DEAT will be responsible for making necessary arrangements for a facility and presentation equipment.  The date is yet to be  determined but will be no later than one week before the end of the project performance period.  The final date of course delivery will be determined in consultation with the contractor, the Project Officer, DEAT and EPA's Office of International Affairs. The contractor may recommend the use of  technology based communication tools where appropriate to take advantage of U.S. based experts in the course of the training.  The contractor shall be responsible for making their own travel arrangements.  NOTE:  The cost of travel shall be included in the total proposal cost as a separate itemized  line  item. DELIVERY SCHEDULE: Task 1: Draft course outline - One month after award, Draft course materials - Three months after award, Task 2: Final course materials - five months after award, Task 3: Course delivery on-site in South Africa - within nine months after award.  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS: Monthly - Teleconference progress reports - no later than the 15th of each month until final course materials are delivered.

<DESC>Electronic responses to this RFI are due January 14, 2005 and should be emailed to victor.cairo@ed.gov and cc: sylvia.reid@ed.gov. There will be a vendor meeting on Dec. 21, 2004 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am. (EST). The purpose of this meeting is for the Government to provide information about the Migrant Education Program and the Migrant Student Information Exchange. Following the information session the Government will allow a question and answer period. The location of this meeting will be at PEC Solutions, 12730 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax, VA. To pre-register for this meeting, please contact Krista Wright at (703) 653-8268 or via email at Krista.wright@pec.com. Same day registration begins at 8:00 am.   

The Dept. of Education (ED) Office of Migrant Education (OME) seeks information about solutions that allow the exchange of data between State Migrant Education student information systems regarding all migratory students. ED is responsible for assisting the States in developing effective methods to transfer migrant student records among the States. Currently the States use a variety of vendor-developed applications and State-developed databases to record and track the migrant student's records. There are a variety of technical architectures of the current migrant student information systems including a web-enabled SQL Server relational database management system and Paradox-based desktop applications.  The current systems are unlinked and therefore migrant student records are not exchanged between them.  In addition, the ED currently lacks the ability to collect national aggregate statistics about the migrant student population.  

OME is interested in seeking information about solutions that would allow OME to (1) leverage existing technology (at the State level) and applications to securely exchange student records on a nationwide basis, (2) protect the student's personal information, and (3) provide national level ad hoc and standard reports. OME is interested in technology that would define, implement, and maintain identity management (or a unique identifier among so many systems).  OME is also interested in providing this capability to institutions that do not currently have/use any existing State applications to track and report migrant students and would be interested in technology that could be securely accessed via the Internet to enter and share data with existing State-based applications and technology.  The information provided from respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used for strategic and tactical planning considerations to include a request for proposal (RFP) for developing, and possibly maintaining, this capability. An awardee of an RFP must be Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level 3 compliant. All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used in the RFP; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be disposed of, and the information will not be considered. Specific information sought includes (1) a description of the technology that allows secure data exchange and transfer between disparate database applications; (2) the ability to collect aggregate statistics from disparate databases on a nationwide basis (3) cost range and expected life cycle operation and maintenance costs; (4) compatibility with access control software, installed and optional, as well as ability to integrate emerging technology; (5) data transfer ability/specifications; and (6) websites or brochures with diagrams, drawings and graphics that would assist the ED in understanding the technology. 

This announcement is for information gathering purposes only. Submittals: Respondents are invited to provide information in the form of product brochures, press releases, technical specification sheets, independent assessment results, reprints of trade journal articles, etc., although electronic media are preferred (CD, diskette, or internet link). Submissions should include complete data sheets, pertinent company information, including contact person, phone number, and fax number and e-mail address.  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. 

Any questions regarding this RFI or the vendor meeting should be directed to Victor Cairo at victor.cairo@ed.gov.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Columbus is considering a solicitation/award that would provide approximately the same features, services, and support included in the current Fleet Automotive Support Initiative (FASI) SP0750-00-D-9714; SP0750-00-D-9715 and SP0750-00-D-9716.  The primary goal in this endeavor is to improve customer support at the user level, ensuring World Wide Military readiness in the process.   The primary customers are the Army and Marine Corps, including the Reserves and National Guard.  However, any DoD activity with land-based vehicles is included in the scope of the program.  The vendor will be required to support the identified vehicles at military installations within the region by providing Class IZ items/ spare parts to the wholesale or retail inventory level, or direct to a user at any specified location.  DSCC will partner with the customer to identify specific vehicles or items for which a FASI prime vendor can provide parts support, technical support, fleet requirements forecasting, inventory management, or other enhanced services as required by the customer.  FASI will improve DLA logistics response time and increase mission readiness at a cost comparable to traditional methods of support.  The Prime Vendor must be capable of receiving and transmitting by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  The Government will transmit orders by EDI using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines for the transfer of acquisition data and invoicing.  The term of the contract will consist of a Base Period of two years with two (2-year) option Periods for a total of 6 years.  
In order to determine whether this initiative would be in the best interest of the Government, we are seeking sources interested in participating.  The potential population for this initiative is 10,000+ items.   Request response from interested parties on or before 01/05/05.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (SBA) - ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING  CONCERNING RESTRUCTURING SIZE STANDARDS AND SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM (SBIR)
<DESC>On December 3, 2004, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). The ANPRM seeks comments from the public on several issues that were raised during the public comment period of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA or Agency) recently withdrawn proposal to restructure its small business size standards. The issues discussed in this ANPRM address matters pertaining to SBA’s size standards but were not part of the March 19, 2004, proposed changes. To assist SBA with examining how best to restructure and simplify its size standards, the Agency invites comments on these issues to take into consideration in any future proposal. The ANPRM also seeks comments on an issue concerning the participation of businesses that are majority-owned by venture capital companies in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. Specifically, the SBA is seeking comments on whether it should provide an exclusion from affiliation with venture capital companies in determining small business eligibility for the SBIR Program. For further information please see http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#anprm.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION PROGRAM (SBIR) - SBA HAS PUBLISHED ITS FINAL RULE
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has revised its small business size regulations regarding ownership and control of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program awardees. The final rule provides that an SBIR awardee must meet the following requirements: (1) it must be a for-profit business concern that is at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States (as the regulations currently require); or (2) it must be a for-profit business concern that is at least 51% owned and controlled by another for-profit business concern that is at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States. This rule does not change the size standard requiring that an SBIR awardee, together with its affiliates, have no more than 500 employees. Because SBA received a large number of comments to its June 4, 2003, proposed rule that concerned ownership of SBIR Program participants by Venture Capital Companies, SBA will issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking additional information on this issue. The ANPRM will also seek additional information on whether SBA should restructure its small business size standards (originally proposed on March 19, 2004).

<SUBJECT>Intent to Procure Sole Source
<DESC>The VA Mid-Atlantic Healthcare Region (VISN6)Central Acquisition Service intends to procure sole source with Union Biomedica for a Copas Biosort System for the VA Medical Center in Durham, NC.  The system is the only system that can analyze, sort and dispense live model organisms while giving real-time readouts to identify/sort different populations based on size/length, optical density, and the presense of flourescent markers.  Traditional flow cytometers use a large electrostatic charge to affect sorting, however, this would be lethal to live organisms such as those being studied in the lab.  The Copas Biosort System will allow the lab to monitor these organisms and recover them after analysis which is an essential part of this program.  NAICS code 334516 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability of respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.  Interested parties that believe they can meet these needs must supply information about their capabilities not later than 4:00pm EST, December 7, 2004.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  No solicitation will be made available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The anticipated award date is December 9, 2004.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR SOLICITATION W914NS-04-R-9003

1.	 Training for SCBA usage is not covered under SOL. I recommend that it be added to the Jordan training course. Could be accomplished in 2 days. The training to be provided is train the trainer type training.  The training to be provided is user level for both the SCBA and Breathing air compressor 

2.	Air Testing. Air quality testing is a NFPA and OSHA requirement and is required every 90 days. We can sort this out for you separately if required. Is a good idea even if not required by law as it helps maintain safe breathing standards.  Information beyond solicitation requirements may be submitted but is not required. 


3.	We work with a number of mfg of both SCBAs and Compressors and I wanted to confirm that you would allow for multiple proposals. This will allow you to get whatever product you want with the best service in the industry.  Multiple Proposals will be acceptable.

4.	RFQ does not specifically indicate that the compressors need to be installed. I see that you request turn key. Does that mean that you will provide the electrical connection if electric? Can you please clarify?  The unit shall be a fixed in place, diesel powered, the installation training will be included with the training program or the manufacturer and can install. 


5.	RFQ indicates that there is a SOW with Place of Performance. Please send this SOW. I do assume that these units will be delivered and utilized all over IRAQ. Please clarify.  The Delivery point for the equipment is Baghdad Civil Defense Warehouse (grid zone coordinates MB349858).  The Training location is still being determined and will be announced in the contract award. We can provide a place to have the training in the Green Zone.

6.	 You have indicated that delivery must take place by August 15, 2004. Is that a set date? I ask because the contracting and evaluation process normally takes a bit of time and there is the lead time with the manufacturers as well as shipping (Air Freight Being much more expensive) transportation with IRAQ (question 3) and if there is to installations (question 2) and customs hold ups to take into consideration.  The date of 15 August is just a ruff estimate as to when we would like to have the equipment in place and the offeror with the closest delivery schedule to meet that time frame will be looked at closer than others.


7.	Can equipment be shipped through the US Military system and delivered to a depot on the East Coast.  No, the shipment will need to be coordinated through your company. The two major shipping companies are FedEx or DHL.

8.	As there are no commercial flights in Baghdad and our techs all hold CAC cards; is it possible that they fly in with AMC flights until commercial flights resume? CAC card holders that are under contract are authorized military airlift.


9.	The compressor does not stipulate an enclosed SCBA fill Station. Is this a requirement?  Yes and this is identified in line item 0001. An enclosed fill station is another requirement of NFPA.

10.	Under the SCBA you have indicated 1824 complete units plus spares. Is that 1824 units with a cylinder plus 1824 spare cylinders? Yes, this is required in Line Item 0002


11.	Under the SCBA you have indicated NFPA compliance. Which NFPA do you wish to comply with as the newest requirement includes HUD (Heads-Up Display) and RIT (HP Quick Refill System) which are both very high tech, expensive and not ideally suited for firefighters that are not of extremely “high tech”. Please clarify. All equipment must meet related NFPA standards, most current edition of each standard. HUD and Quick fill are not high tech. They are both a requirement of the NFPA requirement. 

12.	Regarding Line Item 0004 for maintenance. Nearly all compressors require oil and filter change at 6 months, but this could be performed by anyone who has had the compressor training. Do you want us to include this in the proposal? Most other scheduled maintenance could be performed in one service round. This would also depend on exactly where the equipment would be distributed around IRAQ (question 3). Also are we to quote this to be all inclusive or would you like to have it time and material to be charged only when required for emergency call outs? The maintenance contract is only for technician level requirements.  User level maintenance will be taught during training and included in service manuals


13.	What power source did you want on the compressor? Diesel or Electric and if electrical; what are the requirements?  Fixed Diesel Units

14.	Line item 0003. It says that travel required responsibility of contractor. Am I to understand that we are to provide flights and accommodations for the Students as well?  If the training is out of Iraq yes, if we go with the in Iraq we’ll get them there.
