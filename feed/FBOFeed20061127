<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00035.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 541620; small business size standard $6.5 million.   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human  welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science  Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The  schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for  re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and  sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised  to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the  EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and  integration of the available scientific knowledge base, pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops  website.  If a contractor is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Yvonne Harris at harris.yvonne@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.   The following clauses apply to this request for quote:  FAR  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria:  (See Technical Evaluation Criteria attachment) Offers shall provide information to demonstrate/substantiate that its quote meets the requirements in the Statement of  Work;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations & Certifications-Commercial Items, shall be completed by offeror and submitted with quote, unless the offeror's registered with CCR; FAR 52.212-4, Contract terms & Conditions-Commercial Items;  The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause  52.212-5, Contract Terms & Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items will apply, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13.

The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00039.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 541620; small business size standard $6.5 million.   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human  welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science  Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The  schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for  re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and  sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised  to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the  EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and  integration of the available scientific knowledge base, pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described  in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops  website.  If a contractor is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Courtney Whiting at whiting.courtney@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

Completed work shall conform to the portions of the requirements of the latest edition of the DVA Site Development Design Manual, DVA Master Specifications, A/E Review Checklist for Site and Landscape, DVA Signage Design Guide for Exterior Signage and DVA Accessibility Standards that pertain to landscaping services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Draft Sections L and M, and a revised draft Section B is being issued for Introductory Flight Training and Associated Support Services.  Interested offerors are invited to provide comments and questions in reference to these draft Sections in writing to Ms. Gwen Mills (gwen.mills@randolph.af.mil) with a copy to Ms. Cindy Hall (cindy.hall@randolph.af.mil).  Comments are also requested on the following: 1) Is a 90-day mobilization period adequate?  2)  Are there areas of the contract performance that might be incentivized?  3)  Is the planned student load ramp-up as described in the Work Load Estimate too slow, too fast, or just right?  4)  What is the preferred contract type?  Offerors are advised that Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contracts are limited to 5 years, and multi-year contracts are limited to 8 years.  5)  Is a multi-year or multiple year contract preferred?  Multi-year contracts are defined as a contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than 1, but not more than 5, program years. A multi-year contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if appropriations are not made. (FAR 17.103).  The key distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and multiple year contracts is that multi-year contracts, defined in the statutes cited at FAR17.101, buy more than 1 years requirement (of a product or service) without establishing and having to exercise an option for each program year after the first.  Multiple year contracts are those that have a yearly option that must be exercised, usually, but not always, on the anniversary of the contract award.  Please submit comments and questions to Ms. Mills and Ms. Hall NOT LATER THAN 18 JUNE 2004.  Additionally, there will be a pre-proposal conference on 23 June 04 at 0800, and Industry Day on the afternoon of 23 June, and all day 24 June, if necessary.  Interested offerors should indicate in writing whether or not they will attend one or both meetings.  Industry Day one-on-one appointments will not exceed one hour, and are required to be scheduled in advance with Ms. Mills.  PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE AND INDUSTRY DAY ATTENDEES MUST INDICATE THEIR ATTENDANCE NOT LATER THAN 15 JUNE 2004.

<DESC>Questions and Answers 

1.	Is cover page and table of contents counted in the 20 pages?  

Answer ? No, the 20 page limit does not include the Cover page and Table of Contents


2.	If a prime intends to ultimately propose subcontractors, is the response to the sources sought intended to only represent the Prime?s experience or the team?s experience?

Answer - The response should be  "Turn Key" effort response - that is the Primes' total experience in being able to satisfy the requirements.


3.	Should all subcontractors reply to the sources sought?  In other words, if a potential subcontractor does not reply to the sources sought, does that prevent that firm from being a subcontractor?

Answer - No, the response should be from the prime contractors.  One team - one response.   A primes' ability or lack of ability to "field" the subcontractors at solicitation is something that will be considered during the RFP evaluations


4.	Does the 20-page limit on the Sources Sought response include page allocations for resumes?

Answer ? No,  the 20 page limit does not include the resumes.

OFFERORS? PROPOSALS SHALL BE SUBMITTED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT (MS WORD FOR WINDOWS OR A CLEARLY READABLE .PDF FILE) AND SHOULD BE MARKED APPROPRIATELY IF THEY CONTAIN PROPRIETARY OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION.  HOWEVER, UNCLASSIFIED AND LIMITED PROPRIETARY CONTENT INFORMATION IS RECOMMENDED, AND PREFERRED.  ALL PROPOSALS SHALL REMAIN VALID FOR ACCEPTANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR A PERIOD OF 180 DAYS.

THE MSTAR BAA IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-MSTAR-BAA MODIFICATION 02.


The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  

MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary?s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following change: (a) add ombudsman information.  No other changes have been made. 

Title: Multi-Platform SIGINT Fusion and ISR Management

Technical POC/Program Manager, Carolyn Sheaff, AFRL/IFEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505, Phone (315) 330-7147, e-mail: carolyn.sheaff@rl.af.mil. Contracting POC: Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, AFRL/IFKA, 26 Electronics Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, Phone (315) 330-1955, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques for Cross-Platform SIGINT Fusion and Correlation. 

The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch has developed an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture called the Extensible Data Architecture (XDA) for information fusion under the Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program. This program included support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.

The NSA sponsored Advanced Fusion Workstation (AFWS) developed by AFRL is a government owned and extensible information fusion system built upon the XDA/ASF core services.  In it's present instantiation it is focused on solving the SIGINT fusion problem set.  The extensible nature of the system however, allows it to easily accommodate multiple sensing modalities, and data sources.  One of the major goals of the AFWS is to accommodate inferential reasoning to achieve JDL level II and III fusion.  In the present configuration the system utilizes the K-PASA template based reasoning services of WebTAS.  Ongoing work is incorporating automated reasoners using a Bayesian approach and Demptser Shaefer reasoning capabilities.  The basic premise is to transition from semi, to fully automated inferential reasoning, as the underlying science of the fusion components support such transitions.

The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration into the IFEA Advanced Fusion Workstation XDA-based architecture.  

Specific goals and capabilities include but are not limited to: 

1. AOI Monitor - Provides an operator defined area of interest, within which he/she can define a set of rules to be applied to multi-INT streaming data.  When the real time state occurs the operator is notified. (JDL Level II)

2. Inferential Reasoning Component - Component to provide semi-automated JDL level II fusion.  This component will instantiate multiple reasoning methods that include: 

   A) Operators codified knowledge of patterns of activity based upon a-priori knowledge.  As various states of the activity models are satisfied, operators are notified that predetermined activities are likely occurring.  

   B) Automated inferential reasoning system that may provide SCI level identification of elements in the battlespace, as well as their interaction with one another.  This level of interaction may allow the system to infer intent of entities. 

   C)  Bayesian based automated inferential reasoning approach to solve more complex entity interrelationships problems in the data (JDL Level II and perhaps III).

3. MTI and ELINT Fusion - An MTI to ELINT fusion component should combine the precise geo-location characteristics provided by MTI with precise identity provided by ELINT. (JDL Level I)

4. Emitter Mapping - This service will monitor comms external data and reconstruct C2 and other nodal associations between actors in the battlespace.  The ability to map specific clusters of particular types of comms nodes on the battlefield, will provide the capability to assess force strength, and disposition, as well as potentially identity. (JDL Level I)

5. Automated Creation of Standard Knowledge Bases - Through extension of existing knowledge bases this component will provide a single and coherent source of a-priori knowledge against which other components can reason.  This service will integrate elements of the EIPB output in XML format.

6. Standard I/O methods - Leveraging existing gateways to data sources such as TDDS and TDIMF as well as streaming MTI data.

7. Background Acoustics - Existing background acoustics technology will be integrated into XDA.

8. Speaker ID - Existing speaker ID technology will be integrated into XDA.

9. Imagery and ELINT - Information obtained from available satellite and airborne imagery can be combined with SIGINT information to increase identification accuracy and provide precise target location information needed for targeting. Fusion of SIGINT, IMINT, and other sources is required for hard-to-find targets

10. Ontology Development - Definition and development of standard SIGINT ontology, extension of visualization ontology, and definition of multi-INT ontologies.

11. CONOPS Development - A CONOPS document will be developed for Single Platform, Cross Platform, and AOC/DCGS Fusion Systems.

12. ISR Management - Address the resource management, tasking and re-tasking of multiple, network centric sensors to perform SIGINT correlation and fusion to derive situation assessment in support of military operations.

The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed system will be transitionable to Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center. 

The AFRL, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) is soliciting proposals to develop an open, government owned, Multi-INT fusion capability using ASF/AFWS Core Services Framework. Potential Offerors should have considerable experience and expertise in the following areas:  1)  Insertion of new and legacy fusion components and technologies into the ASF/XDA. 2)  Development of  interfaces, algorithms and databases, coordinate software development and integration of fusion modules; and integrate multiple-sources of sensor and intelligence reports. 3)  Recent operational experience on Rivet Joint, and in the AF DCGS and AF AOC. 4) SIGINT Domain Expertise. 5) ISR Management 6) SEI Level 2 Software Development 7) Risk Management 8) Program Management 9) Multi-INT Scenario Development and Modeling.

The program schedule should contain spiral developments and deliveries. 

The fusion system shall be designed to process, fuse and display the following types of information, as a minimum: Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications (COMINT), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT).  The design of the system shall not preclude the potential ingestion of other intelligence data, for example, Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT. 

Program reviews shall be conducted to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk. 

Capability is sought that can be fully developed and transitioned to operational units as rapidly as possible. Since many applicable technologies exist today, offerors are encouraged to leverage technology from these other programs, as applicable. It is anticipated that offerors will investigate, apply, exploit and modify existing COTS and GOTS technologies. 

Deliverables will include technical reports, user's manuals, training manuals and delivery and integration of robust software prototypes into the AFRL ELINT Development Facility.  In addition, the level of maturity must be adequate to transition to the user community by integration and demonstrations into the DCGS and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center.

<DESC>Subject: AIM-9X Aircrew Training updates 

Description:  
Naval Air Orlando Training Systems Division (NAVAIR Orlando TSD) has a  requirement to provide updates to the AIM-9X Aircrew training.  This requirement is being solicited as a sole source procurement action to Whitney, Bradley & Brown (WB&B) Inc. pursuant to Federal Acqisition Regulation exception 6.302-1 Only one responsible source.  The period of performance will begin in December 2006 and will last for 12 months.

The contractor will provide the Government updates to aircrew training materials [web-based Interactive Courseware (ICW) and briefing materials] with new missile capability, employment, and tactical recommendations for the USN/USMC F/A-18 and USAF F-15C/D platforms based upon the new Sidewinder AIM-9X software version, OFS 8.200 (series).  Specific increased capabilities include "helmetless" High Off-Boresight System (HOBS), ground target capability, and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL).  The aircrew training materials were originally developed by Whiteny, Bradley & Brown (WB&B) as an agent and team member for Raytheon, using Raytheon-owned Data.

<DESC>TRUCK SAFETY RESEARCH USING THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION LARGE TRUCK CRASH CAUSATION STUDY DATABASE.  The U.S. DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is seeking innovative ideas for research to be conducted using data collected in the recently completed Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) produced by the U.S. DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  The Volpe Center invites interested parties to submit a brief research prospectus for consideration in response to this special notice.  Depending on the overall response to this notice, one or more prospectuses may be selected for more detailed examination and potential funding.  Research projects may be of various sizes and scope but should have a tentative budget target of $20,000 to $75,000 and should require fewer than 10 months to complete from the time of initiation.  Information regarding the recommended structure of the prospectus and how to submit a prospectus in response to this notice is presented below. The LTCCS is a multiyear, nationwide study of factors contributing to truck crashes conducted by FMCSA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  Approximately 5,000 people are killed each year in crashes involving large trucks; the goal of the LTCCS is to help FMCSA and NHTSA identify effective crash countermeasures by determining the critical events that contribute to large truck crashes.  The LTCCS is based on a nationally representative sample of large trucks (gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds) involved in traffic crashes that resulted in fatalities or injuries.  Nearly 1,000 incidents were investigated during 33 months of data collection at 24 sites in 17 States.  Data were collected on up to 1,000 elements in each crash.  Two-person teams, each consisting of a trained researcher and a State truck inspector, conducted on-site investigations as soon as possible after each crash occurred.  These data provide a detailed description of the physical events of each crash, along with an unprecedented amount of information about all vehicles and drivers, weather and roadway conditions, and trucking companies that were involved in the crashes.  Potential Research Areas - Research topics should use the LTCCS database as the primary data source and can focus on any aspect of large truck crashes.  Topics of particular interest to the USDOT Volpe Center include fatigue, use of legal and illegal drugs, driver recognition errors (inattention, distraction, inadequate surveillance, etc.), driver decision errors (traveling too fast for conditions, following too closely, false assumptions about other road users? actions, etc.), unfamiliarity with roadway and/or truck, truck vehicle factors, and motor carrier factors.  Studies that combine any of these topics, or those that include a topic not specifically enumerated above but still relevant to large truck crashes and for which information can be drawn from the LTCCS database, will also be considered.  Requested Structure of Submissions - Each research prospectus that is submitted should include:  (1) a brief discussion of the area(s) of truck safety research that the proposed research will address, (2) a list of the LTCCS database elements that will be utilized, (3) descriptions of any other data sources that will be utilized in the research, (4) a brief statement of qualifications regarding the prior research experience, background, and academic and/or professional credentials of the organization or the individual researcher who will conduct the research, (5) a research project timeline, showing all anticipated activities and culminating in a written report to the USDOT Volpe Center within 10 months of the project?s initiation, (5) a budget within the range of $20,000 to $75,000.  Additional Information - Those interested in submitting ideas for research projects can find additional information about the LTCCS on the LTCCS portion of the Analysis and Information (A&I) website  at http://ai.volpe.dot.gov/ltccs/default.asp  For additional information regarding the LTCCS in general, please contact Ralph Craft of FMCSA at (202) 366-0324.  Questions regarding this Special Notice can be directed to Bob Armstrong, USDOT, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Motor Carrier Safety Division, at (617) 494-2946 or Robert.Armstrong@volpe.dot.gov. Deadline for Receipt of Submissions - The deadline for the receipt of submissions is December 29, 2006.  Submissions should be e-mailed to Bob Armstrong, USDOT, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Motor Carrier Safety Division, at Robert.Armstrong @volpe.dot.gov.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<DESC>Description of Future Requirements:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking contractors that are capable of providing an integrated time and attendance processing system that meets the requirements outlined in Attachment A:  USAID Time and Attendance System Requirements and Vendor Questions. 

BACKGROUND

In recent years significant changes in work place habits and technological advances have affected the manner in which time and attendance (T&A) reporting is accomplished. For example, more flexible work schedules and places, and the trend in government to streamline operations have provided a major impetus for changes in T&A systems.  However, perhaps the most significant influence on these changes is advancing technology and the increased use of automation. The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) encourages the movement toward paperless applications and the use of electronic signatures. Although GPEA focuses on electronic systems regarding information obtained from and provided to sources outside the government, it provides an additional impetus to agencies to seek further applications of paperless systems and use of electronic signatures. 

Trends toward increased automation and workplace flexibility have changed the operating environment. However, the need for good internal control continues to exist. 

The primary objective of a T&A system is to ensure that hours worked, hours in pay status, and hours absent are properly reported. Reliable data are important to accurately compute and account for computed pay, leave, and allowances. To achieve this objective, management should have in place an internal control system that provides reasonable assurance that (1) T&A transactions are properly authorized and approved and (2) T&A data are completely and accurately recorded and retained.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Conducting market research and determining the most uniquely capable schedule contractors for a future competition does not constitute a contract award. It is a business decision of the Contracting Team to determine the most uniquely capable schedule contractors through market research for a future competition. The USAID reserves the right to terminate this process and change its requirements if the needs of the USAID change. Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future USAID activities. USAID is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.

MARKET RESEARCH PROCESS

In order to be considered for a future competitive process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Request for Information (RFI) section of this document.

<ARCHDATE>01262007
<CONTACT>Morgan Ross, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3504
<DESC>The U.S. Armys Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), is seeking promising technologies for development of a three  dimensional sensor localization system for narrowband, low-power, ad-hoc  networked sensors in a multilevel structure.   The structure may be a building,  warehouse, or multi-level home whose construction prevents the usage of the GPS  signal inside.   The use of GPS enabled nodes placed outside the building would  be acceptable. Technology of interest will be capable of localizing small, battery  powered nodes within a 10 foot spherical error of their actual position.    Nodes will be equipped with narrowband, multihop capable ad-hoc networking.    This network may be a generic communications link, or a specialized portion of  the localization scheme.   Given the low power requirement, and the environment  of deployment, one should not expect any single node to be capable of direct,  single-hop communications with the entirety of the network. Nodes would be distributed throughout a building, with the possibility of nodes  being carried by personnel moving within the building.   It can be assumed that  a sensor will be deployed in each room.   Adequate distribution models should  use a sensor deployment density of one sensor per 700 or more cubic feet, and  operate in both random and uniform distribution models.   One can also assume a  non-uniform distribution of walls and other RF absorbing structures throughout,  and the system should be capable of handling this varying rate of RF absorption  and reflection in its positioning algorithms. Each of the sensors shall be small and battery-powered.   In an effort to  extend their life, communications output power and processing at each  individual node shall be kept to a minimum.   If extensive processing is  necessary, information may be sent through the network to an external computer  for processing.   This external computer shall be capable of current desktop  computer level of processing. In the past, several approaches have been taken in solving this problem.   One  approach is to use the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) between nodes to estimate  distances between nodes.   This information is commonly retrieved from the  Automatic Gain Control circuitry of the RF radio.   This approach suffers in  the granularity of the AGC and the varying rate of RF absorption in the  environment creating excessive errors in localization.   Another approach is  time of flight, which suffers in environments with excessive multipath, often  causing excessive errors. Solutions should account for possible effects of the environment, and offer  methods to compensate or mitigate their effects.   If such solutions involve  specialized hardware, the solutions should include a physically realizable  description of necessary hardware.   System descriptions should include  expected capabilities and deficiencies of the system, including but not limited  to: system size, power consumption, network throughput requirements, sensor  distribution and density limits, and RF band restrictions. Interested parties shall submit their qualifications and capabilities to meet  the specific needs stated above, with supporting rationale electronically to  the technical POC, Mr. Shafik Quoraishee at shafik.quoraishee@us.army.mil, 973- 724-9462 within 30 days of this notice. This is a market survey/sources sought synopsis for information only and shall not be construed to be a request for  proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  The U.S.  Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market  survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>F--Streamgaging Services
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, 1150 N Curtis Rd, Boise, ID 83706-1234 (Reclamation), under the authority of FAR 13.501, intends to negotiate on a unique source basis a contract with the Oregon Water Resources Department, Salem, Oregon (OWRD), for streamgaging services in the Burnt, Crooked, Malheur, and Powder River Basins and for recorder operation and computation of provisional elevations for Prineville Reservoir.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 924110, Administration of Air and Water Resource and solid Waste Management Programs (no size standard established).  The unique source determination is based on the following:  (1) Reclamation's mission includes management of water resources for irrigation and power generation; (2) Reclamation requires continuous record streamflow data for the subject river basins and elevation data for Prineville Reservoir to support mission accomplishment; (3) OWRD has in-place streamgaging and reservoir recorder stations capable of providing the required data; (4) alternatively, the U.S. Geological Survey could provide the required services, but at a significant increase in cost.  Although this notice is not a request for competitive proposals, the Government will consider responses received by December 8, 2006, that clearly demonstrate a bonafide capability to provide the required services.  The Government will evaluate information received in response to this notice only to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination to compete the proposed acquisition is at the sole discretion of the Government.  A competitive acquisition would likely be under NAICS code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, size standard $6.0 million.

<SUBJECT>Large Truck Crash Causation Study Research
<DESC>TRUCK SAFETY RESEARCH USING THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION LARGE TRUCK CRASH CAUSATION STUDY DATABASE.  The U.S. DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is seeking innovative ideas for research to be conducted using data collected in the recently completed Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) produced by the U.S. DOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  The Volpe Center invites interested parties to submit a brief research prospectus for consideration in response to this special notice.  Depending on the overall response to this notice, one or more prospectuses may be selected for more detailed examination and potential funding.  Research projects may be of various sizes and scope but should have a tentative budget target of $20,000 to $75,000 and should require fewer than 10 months to complete from the time of initiation.  Information regarding the recommended structure of the prospectus and how to submit a prospectus in response to this notice is presented below. The LTCCS is a multiyear, nationwide study of factors contributing to truck crashes conducted by FMCSA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  Approximately 5,000 people are killed each year in crashes involving large trucks; the goal of the LTCCS is to help FMCSA and NHTSA identify effective crash countermeasures by determining the critical events that contribute to large truck crashes.  The LTCCS is based on a nationally representative sample of large trucks (gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds) involved in traffic crashes that resulted in fatalities or injuries.  Nearly 1,000 incidents were investigated during 33 months of data collection at 24 sites in 17 States.  Data were collected on up to 1,000 elements in each crash.  Two-person teams, each consisting of a trained researcher and a State truck inspector, conducted on-site investigations as soon as possible after each crash occurred.  These data provide a detailed description of the physical events of each crash, along with an unprecedented amount of information about all vehicles and drivers, weather and roadway conditions, and trucking companies that were involved in the crashes.  Potential Research Areas - Research topics should use the LTCCS database as the primary data source and can focus on any aspect of large truck crashes.  Topics of particular interest to the USDOT Volpe Center include fatigue, use of legal and illegal drugs, driver recognition errors (inattention, distraction, inadequate surveillance, etc.), driver decision errors (traveling too fast for conditions, following too closely, false assumptions about other road users? actions, etc.), unfamiliarity with roadway and/or truck, truck vehicle factors, and motor carrier factors.  Studies that combine any of these topics, or those that include a topic not specifically enumerated above but still relevant to large truck crashes and for which information can be drawn from the LTCCS database, will also be considered.  Requested Structure of Submissions - Each research prospectus that is submitted should include:  (1) a brief discussion of the area(s) of truck safety research that the proposed research will address, (2) a list of the LTCCS database elements that will be utilized, (3) descriptions of any other data sources that will be utilized in the research, (4) a brief statement of qualifications regarding the prior research experience, background, and academic and/or professional credentials of the organization or the individual researcher who will conduct the research, (5) a research project timeline, showing all anticipated activities and culminating in a written report to the USDOT Volpe Center within 10 months of the project?s initiation, (5) a budget within the range of $20,000 to $75,000.  Additional Information - Those interested in submitting ideas for research projects can find additional information about the LTCCS on the LTCCS portion of the Analysis and Information (A&I) website  at http://ai.volpe.dot.gov/ltccs/default.asp  For additional information regarding the LTCCS in general, please contact Ralph Craft of FMCSA at (202) 366-0324.  Questions regarding this Special Notice can be directed to Bob Armstrong, USDOT, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Motor Carrier Safety Division, at (617) 494-2946 or Robert.Armstrong@volpe.dot.gov. Deadline for Receipt of Submissions - The deadline for the receipt of submissions is December 29, 2006.  Submissions should be e-mailed to Bob Armstrong, USDOT, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Motor Carrier Safety Division, at Robert.Armstrong @volpe.dot.gov.

<SUBJECT>76 -- World Wire News Service
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source purchase order with Reuters America, Inc., 311 South Wacker Drive Suite 1100, Chicago, Illinois 60606 for a subscription to Reuters World Service. This service is to obtain independent, unbiased, detailed coverage of events in the USCENTCOM Area of Interest and Area of Responsibility in meeting analyst requirements for stories on key regional developments, assessments of issues, tip-offs, and detailed reporting. Reports on key regional developments or assessments in areas such as the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian Republics must be provided in depth. Reuter?s news reporting to USCENTCOM?s intelligence analysts enhances protection to forces overseas as well as the continental United States. Extensive access to Reuters World wire news service over the past six years has proven successful in filling gaps in reporting from other news services. Reuter?s World Service is the only service that can meet the detailed level of reporting on a consistent and wide range basis required by USCENTCOM. Reuters has 130 news bureaus world-wide with over 2500 journalists contributing. No other service provides this level of coverage. There are other news organizations that report on some of the same stories Reuters does. However the Reuter?s product has the following particular unique qualifications critical to this requirement: 1. All Reuters? content is proprietary. Reuters generates all its own content and no other provider is licensed to redistribute their live newswires. 2. There is no other similar known provider of news that is not aligned with a particular country, culture or movement and therefore, has no agenda or bias. 
3. There is no other provider of news that has the Breadth of Coverage of Reuters: Reuters has over 2500 contributing journalists. This is important in reporting general international news the following examples highlight why -Invasion of Iraq 2003- Reuters was imbedded and could report breaking news from inside the US military. Every US news organization had to leave Baghdad on the eve of the invasion because as US news organizations they were too vulnerable to attack. Reuters was able to stay. Israeli incursion into Gaza 2006. Because of Reuters independence they were able to report independently and were the only news organization able to report images of Israeli troops operations. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to issue a purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by 4 DECEMBER 2006 at 1200 hours EST. Interested parties may e-mail julie.corchado@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Julie Corchado.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to the Colorado Springs Convention and Visitors Bureau for the purchase of advertising space in the 2007 edition of the Official Visitors Guide.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health has a requirement for an eye tracking system.   The system has the following requirements:  1) high spatial resolution (gaze position accuracy <0.5 degrees) to know exactly where people are looking; 2) high tempororal resolution (approx. 1000 Hz data sampling) with short processing latencies, to be able to present stimuli contingent on specific eye positions or on particular eye movements; 3) wide field of view, to be able to monitor eye movements to stimuli presented both in central and peripheral vision; 4) stable set-up and head restraint to minimize head movement during eye tracking. 

The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial, applies to this acquisition.   The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, is applicable.     Specific evaluation criteria are:  (1) Ability to meet technical specifications and (2) ability to deliver on time and within specification.

MODIFICATION ONE IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION.  The Government requires an eye tracking system both for the psychophysical studies and to test and train participants prior to running them in MRI or MEG stuies.  Eye movement monitoring is psychophysical studies is required for a number of reasons.  For some studies, it is critical that participatnts maintain stable fixation, and eye movement monitoring allows the Government to ensure that only those trials in which fixation was maintained are included in the analyses.  In other studies, eye movements will be used as an indicator of what visual information participants are using to discriminate visual objects.  In a further set of studies, visual stimulus presentation will be contingent on specific eye movements.

<CONTACT>Edgar Angulo, (928)328-6172
<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide answers/questions and is provided as amendment 0001 to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The closing date has been extended until 12:00 PM MST, 04 December 2006. Q1. Refer to: 2.1, Required Characteristics and Performance; Input: paragraph f.  Responds to 5ns to greater than 500 ns over TTL to + 15V range. What is the range of the pulse widths with these respective rise times?   A1. 50-60 ns at high rates such as 10 MPPS to about 50 ms at low rates. Q2. Refer to: 2.1, Required Characteristics and Performance; Input: paragraph g.  Repetition rate irregular (0) to 1 MPPS. Please confirm that pulses defined in f, above, at irregular intervals from long times between pulses, (0), to a maximum repetition rate of 1 mega pulses per second.             A2. Confirmed.  We may wait all day for a fire pulse or need to use the unit t o distribute clocking signals at 1 MPPS.  In between these extremes are applications requiring rate of fire and velocimetry pulses in a range of 0.1 PPS to 60 PPS. 			       Q3. Refer to: 2.2, Required Characteristics and Performance; Outputs: paragraph j. Delay between input and output rising edges 5 ns maximum. The selection of elements necessary to meet the isolation requirements on both input and output required introduce significant signal delays. While it may not be impossible, it will at least be expensive to meet this specification. Is there any flexibility  in the input to output delay?  									                   A3. Yes, there is limited flexibility.  Relaxing the delay/latency from 5 ns to up to about 50 ns will be acceptable for nearly all applications except usage in supplying clock pulses, particularl y at the desired 10 MPPS. Q4. Same paragraph: Is it correct that the delay specifications are measured from the input at the supplied equipment to the output source of the supplied equipment? 								                   A4. Yes, checked at the input and output BNC jacks. Q5. Refer to: 2.2, Required Characteristics and Performance; Outputs: paragraph d.  Logic high 4 Volts minimum into 50 ohm load each channel. Is it the intension of this specification that each channel of the equipment provide full isolation between output channels and be capable of sourcing 80 ma of current to the load? 					           Q5.Yes. Q6 Refer to: 2.2, Required Characteristics and Performance; Outputs: paragraph e.  Logic high 0.8 Volts maximum. Does the equipment have to sink current from the load source while achieving full isolation and driving the loads?                                                                                        A6.  The following answer is based on some interpretat ion.  No, the equipment is not required (or desired) to sink any current provided by the load.  It does need to drive the load and isolate the load from affecting any adjacent channels.
