<DESC>PM Soldier Equipment  Technical Management Division (TMD) has a requirement for the testing and evaluation of blunt and blast injury biomechanics. An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with four option years is anticipated. The Government intends to procure through Simplified Acquisition Procedures (commercial items) under NAICS 541712 with a small business size standard of $7 million. The nature and details of injury resulting from behind armor blunt trauma and blast events is still unknown. The ability of TMD to develop personal protection equipment (PPE) for effective mitigation of the various injury mechanisms is contingent upon a full and complete understanding of blunt and blast injury biomechanics. Anthropometric test devices (ATD) are novel tools for the testing and evaluation of PPE. The services of a scientist or engineer, with technical support, are required to develop experimental protocol and guide testing of these parameters. This work cannot be completed in house because of the equipment availability and cost. The vendor selected for the performance of this statement of work must have specific experience in biomechanical evaluation of blunt and blast injury as evidenced by publication in peer-reviewed journals. The vendor must have achieved technical training equivalent to the Ph.D. level with a strong background in research engineering. It is not required for the Principle Investigator of this effort to possess a security clearance. A minimum clearance of SECRET is highly desired. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.<BR>Award will be made to the best value proposal, which is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government. The official release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the internet at the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website located at the following address: https://acquisition.army.mil. The on-line version of the RFP will include all documents of the solicitation package. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the solicitation. The complete solicitation package, including amendments should be received and reviewed prior to submitting response. It is the responsibility of those responding to the solicitation to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around 29 December 2010. Ashley Klapka is the point of contact for this action, email: ashley.klapka@us.army.mil. All questions to this solicitation shall be submitted in writing and emailed to the above listed address. Please hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.<BR>	<BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT - THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 TO ISSUE A WORK ORDER FOR TESTING,FACILITIES, OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND ENGINEERING UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AWARDED,COMPETITIVE, 8(A) CONTRACT NNC05CA95C WITH SIERRA LOBO INCORPORATED.   THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts under the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.	Recovery act funds for NASAs Fundamental AeroProgram (FAP) are being utilized to help design, develop and test aircraft-engineultra-high bypass (UHB) component technology hardware for the Environmentally ResponsibleAviation Project, Propulsion Technology Sub-Project, Propulsor Element, Isolated andInstalled GTF testing 9x15 Sub-Element.NASA Glenn Research Center has the capability to test scale models that simulate aircraftengine propulsion in the Centers wind tunnel facilities.  Some of these scale models areconcepts of the next generation of todays aircraft engines, called turbofans.	The windtunnel testing is performed to determine the performance and noise levels of new turbofanengine designs.  A special test rig is used to power these model turbofans.  The test rigis called the Ultra High Bypass Drive Rig, or UHB Drive Rig.  The UHB Drive Rig providespower to the model turbofan during testing through a shaft that connects the modelturbofan to a special air motor in the back of the Drive Rig.  Hot, high pressure air issent to the special air motor to spin it and the connecting drive shaft, and then intothe model turbofan.  The air is supplied through pipes that come through a central supplybuilding at Glenn to the wind tunnel then to the Drive Rig.  To make sure the Drive Rigis healthy and running smoothly and safely, there are special temperature sensors,pressure sensors and vibration sensors connected to the rotating parts inside the DriveRig.  How well the model turbofan is performing is also measured using devices calledforce balances.  There are two force balances in the Drive Rig used to determine how muchthrust the model is producing and how much power it is taking to make that thrust.  Oneforce balance is connected to the spinning rotor, or fan, inside the model and spins withthe fan; the other balance is connected to the non-spinning parts of the model called thestators and nacelle.  Together they measure how much total force is produced by themodel.Since all moving parts eventually wear out, the Drive Rig mechanical parts have to beinspected and rebuilt after every 2,000 hours of operation, or about every four years onaverage.  This means the Drive Rig must be taken apart, the parts looked at with specialequipment, the worn out parts replaced or rebuilt, and the Rig then put back together. Some of the parts also must be checked to make sure they operate like new, for instancethe force balances.  The safety and health sensors inside the Drive Rig must also bereplaced at this time.	Once all repairs are done, the Drive Rig is like new again.  ThisDrive Rig has been rebuilt twice before over the last fourteen years.  It requiresspecially trained people and special equipment to do all the tasks needed to make theDrive Rig operate as it was designed to by its manufacturer.These efforts will ensure the UHB Drive Rig is compliant with current applicable GRC windtunnel facility testing standards (e.g.  NASA-TM-106565).  Refurbishing the UHB Drive Rigwill restore the test rig to its fully operational condition, allowing it to reach theoriginal performance capabilities as designed by the original manufacturer.  The datameasurements systems on board (the two force balances) will be recertified to insurequality data is obtained (per original manufacturer specifications provided to NASA).  A fully capable test rig will allow wind tunnel testing of advanced scale model turbofanpropulsion designs, which will provide data for validation and enhancement of predictionand system design analysis tools.Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice.

Recovery Act funds for NASAs AeronauticsResearch Program will accelerate key research, enhance the state of aeronautics for thenation, and provide a foundation for addressing the need for a Next Generation AirTransportation System (NextGen.)  To increase the safety of aviation, better information on the performance of aircraft jetengines is required.   To produce such information, electronic circuits that are able tosense the engines performance while it is operating and transmit the collected datawirelessly must be placed inside the engine.   This presents an extremely harshenvironment for the operation of the electronic circuits, especially in terms ofoperating temperatures which exceed 300 o C.  In order to enable electronic circuits thatcan operate in such harsh environments, and can also be manufactured into small,lightweight, and non-intrusive packages, new materials must be used and new fabricationprocesses developed.There are a range of components which are necessary to enable this high-temperatureengine performance monitoring and data transmitting circuit. This includeshigh-temperature packaging and interconnects as well as components within the circuititself.  One major and fundamental circuit component is a capacitor.   This task will develop and validate a process for fabricating a capacitor that can beintegrated into the high temperature circuit, using a material called silicon carbide. While silicon based semiconductors have enabled quite complex room-temperature circuitsto be miniaturized onto small chips, the extension of this technology to temperaturesabove 300 C is impractical. Silicon carbide (SiC) is the strongest candidatesemiconductor for implementing 400-600 C integrated elNNC019dddectronics. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice.

Altering this device selection would affect any current development, which would adversely affect ship and mission performance. Drawings have already been provided to facilitate a smoother integration with the MVCS hardware. The expected award date will be approximately 04 Jan 2010. The NAICS code is 332114.
Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Bldg. 100, 110 Vernon Ave., Panama City Beach, Florida 32407-7018, c/o David Mixon, NSWC Contracting Specialist, 850-636-6085.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - Z - The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified Design/Build contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220. The size standard is $33.5 million per year. This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19).
<p>All firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letterhead. This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the pre-proposal conference and the firm's DUNs number Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than September 15, 2009. Send documentation to General Services Administration, Attn: Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, 819 Taylor Street, Room 12B01, Fort Worth, TX 76102, or carrie.haman@gsa.gov. GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.). The estimated contract value is $80,000,000 to $100,000,000. Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just design and/or construction. Contractors should price according to the specifications. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is scheduled to be issued on or about September 15, 2009, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). Firms must send the letter of intent to gain access to the documents. A site-visit and Pre-proposal conference for Phase I is tentatively scheduled to be held on or about September 29, 2009, in Houston, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project and technical evaluation criteria. Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. GSA intends to contract for complete design and construction services with the design/build contract that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to design and construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration proposes major structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing upgrades to Houston's 26 year-old, twenty-two story U.S. Federal Building. While there are many work items, the following are especially significant. They include:</p>
<p>Replacement of the exterior building envelope with a new curtain wall system attached to the outside of the existing building structure; significant improvements to the outdoor plaza, installation of a new covered breezeway and garage improvements; retrofit of structural deficiencies discovered during the due diligence phase in design development; interior upgrades inclusive of finish and ADA upgrades at all non-compliant restrooms, first floor upgrades; significant improvements to the HVAC system; lighting controls to maximize energy efficiency opportunities created by improved day lighting within tenant space resulting from the new curtain wall and HVAC improvements. LEED Project certification is required with LEED Silver being the project goal.</p>
<p>The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 36.3 Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and Part 15 Source Selection procedures using the Best Value/Trade-off process. Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire design and construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project. The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202); based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The procurement process will be performed in two (2) phases. The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both phases. Phase I Submission Requirements: Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for technical documents from those firms responding to this FBO announcement. Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Phase II) at no recompense to the offeror(s) ?. The technical factors for Phase I RFQ are tentatively as follows: (#1) Construction Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; (#2) Design Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; and (#3) Key Personnel Experience and Past Performance. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of offerors that offer the best value will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306(c) to further compete in Phase II. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Phase I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s). Phase I submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer on or about October 15, 2009. Phase II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The technical factors for Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP) are tentatively as follows: (#1) Design Incorporating Approach and Project Approach; (#2) Preliminary Project Schedule. Price proposals and a Subcontracting Plan (if the offeror is not a small business concern) will also be required during Phase II. This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA's Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (36%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable. Phase II submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on or about January 6, 2010. GSA shall schedule two site visit opportunities during this Phase. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business December 22, 2009. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.</p>
<p>All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-09-UY-C-0008. This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. Reporting requirements from the contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation or request for a proposal. This is only a sought for information.
<p>Executive Summary: USCENTCOM requires a baseline assessment of its Information Management (IM) and Information Technology (IT) structures and processes in support of establishing a Knowledge Management (KM) program to include the establishment of a KM organization within the command as well as a Command Knowledge Management Officer (CKMO). This study will include but is not be limited to: the review of current IM Officer and Chief Information Officer (CIO) roles and responsibilities, key functions and processes currently executed in support of IM within the Headquarters and the functions and processes within USCENTCOM, its components and assigned Joint Task Forces (JTFs).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) of 1996 shapes the government's approaches to information management and information technology (IM/IT) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mission performance.</p>
<p>The CENTCOM Assessment Team (CAT) report revealed that there is not a Department-wide definition of KM and provided a recommended definition. Additionally, three other discussions were included, specifically Communities of Interest (COI), Information Capture and Knowledge Exchange (ICKE), and the Three Needs Model (3NM - Need-to-Know, Need- to-Share, and Need-to-Use). These concepts are also pertinent to the understanding KM and the establishment of a KM program.</p>
<p>USCENTCOM has not established an organization to provide governance, leadership and stewardship for KM, but has recognized the requirement to do so. The outcome of this study will become the foundation for the Command's movement towards attaining this goal.</p>
<p>1. SCOPE/OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The focus of this task is to perform a comprehensive baseline study of the Command's IM organization and processes, use of technology (IT) currently employed at USCENTCOM and its components/JTFs to support IM and KM business practices to include the capture, storage, indexing, exchange, security (to include operational security considerations), accessibility and presentation of information in order to promote the ability to improve and reduce the decision making cycle required in support of USCENTCOM mission and our national defense.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the assessment team will provide, at a minimum:</p>
<p>&bull; Final study report with recommendations on organization structure (CKO) and primary KM functions<br />&bull; A draft implementation plan for the establishment KM organization and initial priorities for KM within the command<br />&bull; A proposed outline for a draft KM regulation<br />&bull; A proposed outline for a KM Strategic Plan<br />&bull; A proposed draft Strategic Vision Statement <br />&bull; A report/discussion on the use of current information technologies in use in this command that can be utilized to support KM as well as those technologies that are used outside this command that could be beneficial in support of USCENTCOM KM efforts</p>
<p>2. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The period of performance for this delivery order shall be approximately 120 days from the award of the contract.</p>
<p>3. TASK DESRIPTIONS. Contractor team shall accomplish their assessment in the following three phases:</p>
<p>a. PHASE 1. Data Collection<br />1. Review existing documentation and regulations.<br />2. Conduct key leader and stakeholder interviews and focus groups.</p>
<p>b. PHASE 2. Analysis<br />1. Assess operational and business processes.<br />2. Assess manpower requirements and organizational structure to meet requirements.<br />3. Assess technologies that support information and knowledge management process across the USCENTCOM Command and Control (C2) organizational structures and IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>c. PHASE 3. Finalize Recommendations, COAs, and Presentation of Results <br />1. Provide final deliverable products to the CENTCOM study coordinator NLT 96 hrs prior to the final outbrief of results. <br />2. The contractor shall present and formally deliver the Final Briefing and Report to the Government.</p>

The contractor will review existing and current draft USCENTCOM regulations, CONOPS and instructions pertaining to processes and governance of IM and IT for applicability to a KM program.<br />c. The contractor will review existing and current draft USCENTCOM Theater Campaign Plan and identify where KM can be inserted and leveraged to support this and associated plans such as Security Cooperation to meet USCENTCOM Strategic Goals <br />d. The contractor will conduct necessary interviews with USCENTCOM leadership, or their designated representatives in order to understand the KM needs of the command, the operational/business processes of the command, develop an assessment of current levels of satisfaction, and identify and assess senior leadership views on the establishment of a command CKMO.<br />e. The contractor will conduct necessary interviews with USCENTCOM functional and technical subject matter experts in order to assess the level of knowledge/skills resident in the CENTCOM staff for KM functions, understand the KM needs of the command, the operational/business processes of the command, develop an assessment of current levels of satisfaction, and identify and address the users and implementers within the establishment of a command CKMO.<br />f. The contractor will ensure an electronic record is kept of all interviews, briefings and reports used in the study process.<br />g. The contractor will provide accountability to the study coordinator at the end of each phase.<br />h. The contractor will provide a final report to designated USCENTCOM staff (e.g. CCJ3).</p>

<DESC>Coyote AGAR CM100 Brand Name or Equal in accordance with 52.211-6
<p><br />The Otis Laboratory (USDA, APHIS, PPQ, CPHST) has been using a High Wheat Germ diet for the rearing of gypsy moth larvae in their mass rearing facility since the late 1970s. This diet contains agar as a gelling agent. Proper gelling of the diet is necessary to produce a diet uniformity that allows for the optimum rearing of healthy gypsy moth life stages. The Otis Laboratory has tested many sources of agar and has found that an agar harvested in Chile provides the proper gelling strength for our diet needs. Before the Otis Laboratory can accept an agar, a sample must be obtained and used in diet to rear gypsy moth larvae.</p>
<p>Due to the long life cycle of the moth, and the requirement to rear two generations because problems often appear in the offspring generation, these tests will require 14 months to complete.</p>
<p>Any new sources of Chilean agar will have to go through similar studies before the Otis Laboratory can accept them for use in the High Wheat Germ diet.</p>

<DESC>Multiple Day Boat Charter Service Market Research Effort

Notice Type:		Sources Sought				
Response Date:		January 13, 2010
NAICS Code:		487210

Requirement Synopsis:
The Forest Service is conducting Market Research to identify potential offerors capable of meeting the requirement below and collect approximate estimates of what would be charged by interested offerors to provide this service.

Description of Service
The Forest Service is considering the costs associated with chartering a boat to transport and berthing work crews in the proximity of four Southeastern Alaska locations to remote working sites and providing living accommodations for the number of the crew.  It is possible that the Forest Service will award one or more one year contracts with no more than three option years to engage boats at these four locations of different berthing capacities.  To be considered adequate, the boat must meet the following characteristics.  
Required Boat Characteristics:
Carry two outboards, powered boom, berths for 6 (or 12), office, galley w/range and refrigerator, (2) toilet and lavatory and shower, hot & cold running fresh water, large clothes dryer,  heaters in rooms, 115V, DC, 5KW and 3KW Backup diesel generator.  Pilot and necessary personnel to provide service are to be provided.
The contractor would be responsible for assuring all federal, state, and local requirements associated with performance are met, including inspection, licensing, permits, etc.
The contractor would be responsible for having the boat(s) available for the Forest Services exclusive use during the period of April 15th to October 15th, for which a Daily Availability Rate would be paid to the contractor, simply for reserving the availability of the service.  Additionally, a Daily Use rate would be paid for each day that the contractor is actually providing the service, which would include all costs associated with the provision of the service, to include cooking, fuel, piloting, boat maintenance, etc.  
Currently, the Forest Service is investigating the possibility of retaining the services of boats capable of carrying a smaller and larger quantity of people.  The first type of boat for which the Forest Service hopes to acquire cost estimates would be capable of accommodating 6 people.  The second type of boat for which cost estimates are requested would be capable of accommodating 12 people.  
At this time it is anticipated that periods of use would be no less than one day and no more than ten days.  Details such as the amount of notice given before service is required, extent of whats involved for different functions contractor is responsible for providing, etc., will be addressed in the event a solicitation for this service is issued.  


Interested Offerors Responses
With the information currently available it is requested that interested offerors would provide the following information by completing the information below.
Type of Boat	Daily Availability Rate (for 180 days)	Daily Use Rate (for those days used)
Berthing (6 or less)	$__________	$__________
Berthing (12 or less)	$__________	$__________

-Location for which the Rates apply (Sitka, Juneau, Petersburg, or Ketchikan)
-Makes and models of the boats considered for use
-Additional information or issues that a solicitation should contain.
	-Suggestions for what is reasonable to request in such a service

Additional Project Details
-The estimated magnitude of the project is between  $100,000 and $300,000 annually.
-The Forest Service is analyzing availability of suitable marine vessels (M/V) for this purpose that would operate out of Sitka, AK; Juneau, AK; Ketchikan, AK; and Petersburg, AK. 
The Forest Service desires that firms interested in this project as a prime contractor identify themselves by the submission of a brief white paper that contains responses to the questions above as well as identification information.  We ask for this paper to be submitted as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) Attachment in an email to Gordon Brooks (gbbrooks@fs.fed.us, with a courtesy copy furnished (cc) to Sherman Mayle (smayle@fs.fed.us) by close of business on Wednesday January 13, 2010. 
	a) Advice on the timetable that the acquisition should follow in order to provide for contract award by May 1, 2010;
	b) Other advice, recommendations, or cautions for the Forest Service as we consider this approach for this service.
-The Forest Service is not scheduling a pre-solicitation conference at this time. We hope all interesting parties will share this information with us through the white paper as requested above. The Forest Service has not yet made a definitive decision to issue a solicitation, and it has not made any definitive decisions regarding work scope, acquisition strategy, extent of competition, NAICS code, and so forth. The information we learn from the white papers will help us as we make these decisions. Other exchanges with industry may occur in the near future; this may include a pre-solicitation conference of one-on-one meetings with some or all white paper submitters.  Your participation and assistance through the submission of a white paper is appreciated.

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; 1. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is studying alternatives to expand its airborne Psychological Operations (PSYOP) broadcast capabilities. The Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft in this study is the C-130J Hercules modified with aerial refueling receptacle, 60/90 KVA engine generators, auxilary third crew position, and intercom system upgrades (aka, "Super J"). To complete the study and consider programming initiatives, USSOCOM requires current industry sources, capabilities, and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost information. <br /><br /><br />
<p>2. The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify aircraft modifications, and their associated costs, required to support simultaneous FM radio and television (VHF-High and UHF) broadcasts from 250-5,000W transmitters installed in racks mounted on roll-on/roll-off pallets. Modifications include signal and power distribution, environmental control, broadcast antenna installations, and workspace for 1-2 equipment operators. Cost data (e.g., engineering, analysis, installation labor, documentation, training, testing, etc.) for the modifications and interfaces to the government furnished palletized equipment will be used to prepare budgetary planning estimates and potential programming initiatives for the fiscal year 2012 Program Objective Memorandum (POM12).</p>
<p>3. USSOCOM seeks information from responsible sources and interested parties who have proven track records in aircraft engineering and systems integration, performance testing (including flight test), and factor sustainment in proposed solutions.</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher. Adaptation of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or commercial solutions is encouraged.</p>
<p>a. Easily installed /removed antennas and allow modifications for support structure. <br />b. Installation time to configure the aircraft, including operations checks should be eight hours or less. <br />c. The remaining cargo space would be used to support PSYOP requirements such as spares, personnel, test equipment, etc. when deploying. With the PSYOP pallets installed the aircraft would not be used as a reduced capacity trash hauler.</p>
<p>The Special Operations Forces (SOF) C-130Js are multi-mission aircraft and modifications for the broadcast equipment must support the following operational requirements: quick connect/disconnect of palletized equipment . The aircraft modifications must not impede using the cargo area for other missions when the broadcast equipment pallet is removed. The modifications supporting the broadcast equipment must be sustainable through 2025.</p>
<p>5. Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the required performance enhancement challenges with low integration risk to the SOF C-130J inventory. Respondents are encouraged to provide information on all or any subset of the areas listed. No adverse evaluation will result from responses, which address only those specific areas applicable to one's core business expertise.</p>
<p>6. Respondents are to use a minimum number of pages to describe in detail the information requested. Limit responses to no more than twenty-five (25) 8 &frac12;" x 11" single sided pages, including attachments, figures and/or drawings. Responses are due&nbsp;21 January 2010.&nbsp; Responses should be sent via e-mail to the Point of Contact associated with this announcement.</p>
<p>7. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for possible uses of platforms within the military.

<SUBJECT>Infrastructure for Nondestructive, Real-Time Fingerprinting of Integrated Circuits
<SOLNBR>09_333
<RESPDATE>012210
<CONTACT>Jack Euske, Phone (925) 294-2646, Email jeuske@sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy's physical security needs, is seeking one or more business partners in the area of integrated circuits technology.  Sandia is seeking to commercially license the technology described in this posting and to engage in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) to further develop the technology.  Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to license the intellectual property for reasonable compensation.  It is expected that any licensees will promptly incorporate the technology into a commercial product.
<p>This technique forms the basis for a method of deterring the insertion of counterfeit parts and/or hard-to-detect subversions of ICs by enabling low cost means of identifying individual ICs at various points in the life cycle.  We further envision that IC manufacturers will be economically attracted to implement this means in order to minimize loss of profit due to hard-to-detect insertion of counterfeit parts into the supply chain.  The ability to identify a specific integrated circuit at various times in the life cycle would form a deterrent against wholesale substitution of the component with a counterfeit and/or subverted part, due to the improved forensic ability to trace discovered subversions to their source and the perpetrator's aversion to discovery and attribution.</p>
<p>The goal for the development of Nondestructive, Real-Time Fingerprinting of Integrated Circuits is to deploy more secure information processing systems by advancing the state of the art for authentication of microelectronics components to protect against counterfeit components and component subversion by substitution. To achieve authentication of components, the leverage of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology is being sought out. PUFs are derived from random physical characteristics of the system from which they are sourced, which makes a PUF output difficult to predict from one device to another. The random PUF output can subsequently be used to aid authentication using cryptographic challenge-response techniques. These techniques appear to be so promising for component authentication that other applications such as validation of hardware and software configurations will likely benefit from use of similar PUF technology and associated infrastructure.</p>
<p>These techniques are ready to be refined and integrated into a "JTAG-accessible" function block that can be universally inserted into almost any digital and/or mixed signal IC using industry standard interfaces and requiring no additional I/O pads or pins.</p>
<p>Potential partners must provide information describing their ability to research, design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional diagnostics systems.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail to Jack Euske by January 22, 2010 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 9290, P.O. Box 969, 7011 East Avenue, Livermore, CA  94551, E-mail: jeuske@sandia.gov, Phone: (925) 294-2646.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.  Include company and contact information, as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to the formation of a CRADA partnership or license and the subsequent commercialization of this technology.  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, as to why they should be considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>Geotechnical Engineering And Related Services, various locations in the North Atlantic Division (NAD) Mission Areas (ME, MA, CT, RI, NH, VT, NY, NJ, PA, DE, MD, WV, VA, and DC)<BR><BR>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Indefinite Delivery Contract that will provide for the capability to issue a series of task orders not to exceed $1,000,000 in one calendar year. At the option of the Government, this contract may be extended for four one-year periods. The Government may award a second contract to the second most highly qualified firm in response to this announcement at any time up until one year from the closing date of this announcement.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, a Small Business Subcontracting Plan, prepared in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, must be submitted prior to contract negotiations and approved by the government before contract award.  The Subcontracting Plan is not required with this submittal.  New England District encourages all small businesses to participate as prime and should consider teaming with other businesses.  Small businesses for this contract action are defined under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) of 541330, which specifies that the firms have no more than $4,500,000 in average annual receipts over the past 3 fiscal years.  Award of contract to the subsequently selected firm is anticipated in February or March 2010.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.<BR><BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Contract will provide general geotechnical engineering and related services at various locations in the Corps North Atlantic Division (primarily New England).  This includes, but is not limited to, support to the New England District Dam and Levee Safety Programs, support of Civil Works Construction programs, and environmental restoration and remediation projects. Ancillary work in support of civil works projects includes expertise in hydrology, hydraulics (with knowledge and experience with applicable computer programs such as HEC RAS, HEC HMS, Dambreak, etc.), structural, mechanical, electrical and civil engineering.<BR><BR>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below.  Factors are listed in descending order of importance. Criteria a-h are primary factors.  Criteria i-k are secondary factors and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.<BR> <BR> (a)  Professional Qualifications. The firm must have on its own staff or provide through a consultant(s), professional engineers with demonstrated geotechnical, structural, mechanical, electrical and civil engineering expertise registered in all six New England States (ME, MA, VT, CT, RI and NH), as well as geologists, including registered professional geologists.   The firm must also include a statement that they have the ability to obtain Professional Engineering and Geologist registration in all other NAD states (identified above) and the District of Columbia in a timely manner if required.  Firms not meeting this requirement will be considered unqualified.<BR><BR>(b) Firms must demonstrate Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the following fields: 1. Earth Embankment Dam and Levee Design, Evaluation, Inspection and Construction, including seepage, stability, seismic and deformation analyses and design of special foundation treatments such as grouting and slurry wall cutoffs.  2. Evaluation of Earth and Rock Structures using conventional and finite element analyses.  3. Seismic Evaluation of Structures.  4. Risk and Reliability Evaluation of Earth Structures.  5. Embankment Instrumentation, Monitoring and Evaluation.  6. Designing, Performing, and Inspecting Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation and Testing Programs.  7. Preparing Geotechnical Instrumentation Reports Related to Dam Safety.  8. Investigation, Analysis, and Determination of Groundwater Flow Patterns, Properties, and Hydraulic Parameters.  9. Performing Geophysical Investigations including Borehole Logging to Determine Physical, Chemical, and Other Environmental Parameters of Subsurface Soils, Bedrock, and/or Groundwater 10. Design and Installation of Geothermal Systems.  11. Experience in Hydraulics and Hydrology.  12.  Study/Design Experience Utilizing Structural, Mechanical, Electrical and Civil Engineering.  13. Stability, seepage and stress analyses using the latest version of the GEOStudio suite of  programs currently 2007).<BR><BR>(c) Past Performance. The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, ability to manage subcontractors, customer-oriented approach to project delivery and positive references from customers.  It is the responsibility of the Prime Contractor to explain how the Past Performance Information is relevant to the proposed contract.<BR><BR>(d) Capacity.  The firm must have the capacity to accomplish the work in required time.<BR><BR>(e) Knowledge of the Locality.  The firm must demonstrate knowledge of local soils and geology of the New England States. <BR><BR>(f) Firms must have capability to provide all deliverables in MicroStation SE CADD software, release 7 or higher, electronic digital format.  The Government will only accept this format, without conversion or reformatting.<BR><BR>(g) Firms must demonstrate previous experience in preparing construction cost estimates with the Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis methodology. The firm shall also demonstrate experience in the development of construction contingencies based upon the knowledge of Risk Analysis and level of design detail.<BR><BR>(h) Firms must demonstrate knowledge of preparing specifications for construction contracts using a personal computer based software package.  All specifications for Corps of Engineer (COE) contracts will be prepared using Unified Federal Guide Specifications and SPECSINTACT.  <BR><BR>(i) Small Business and Small Disabled Business Participation.  The extent of participation of SB (including Women Owned), SDB, historically black colleges<BR>and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration.<BR><BR>(j) Geographic Proximity.  Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project.  It will have very little bearing on this selection.<BR><BR>(k) Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  DoD A-E contract awards will be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms. <BR><BR>4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms being able to perform this work must submit Part I of the SF 330 for the team and Part II of the SF 330 for the prime firm (or joint venture).  Part II of the SF 330 must also be submitted for each consultant.  Please note that a separate Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors when they will have a key role in the proposed contract.  Submissions must be made to:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Rachael Raposa, Chief, Contracting Branch, not later than the close of business on the 30th day after the date of this announcement.

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a Federal contract.  Information regarding registration can be obtained online at www.ccr.gov or through CCR Assistance Center (CCRAC) at 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725.  Effective immediately, the use of DUNS+4 numbers to identify vendors is limited to identifying different CCR records for the same vendor at the same physical location.  For example, a vendor could have two records for themselves at the same physical location to identify two separate bank accounts.  If you do not have a DUNS number, or want to register subsidiaries or other entities, visit http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/ or call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711.

<DESC>* Clarification posted concerning shipment of transmission cores.&nbsp; The RSMS FT Riley will have the transmission cores mounted on shipping cradles to be loaded onto the awarded offerors truck for hauling to place of overhaul.&nbsp; If an offeror does not wish to use the RSMS cradles but instead their own crating that is at the discretion of the offeror but it is not required.&nbsp; Therefore any additional costs an offeror adds into their proposal covering these crating costs will be figured in with the total cost(s) proposed.<br /><br />*Clarification for cracked transmisssion cores or other unserviceable cores that cannot be overhauled must be returned to the RSMS FT Riley for replacement of said cores.&nbsp; The final disposition of unserviceable cores for the purpose of overhaul will be determined by the RSMS FT Riley technical staff.<br /><br /><br /><br />MT654 Transmission Serial Numbers: (A3314) -or- (2420118842) Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a full and open competition under NAICS code 811113 (Automotive Transmission Repair). Solicitation reference number W912JC-10-R-5701 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the overhaul of the MT654 Allison Transmission NSN: 2520-01-117-3010. See NMWR reference 9-2520-594 attached. Contract Type and Estimated Quantities: This solicitation will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery &ndash; Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract. The base year contract begins approximately February 2010 thru January 2011 with the option for four additional one-year periods. The additional one year contract options are exercised if the product performance and customer service from the contractor is deemed to be of a satisfactory or better nature. The estimated quantities: Maximum quantity 150 each 1st contract base year and 150 each thereafter for each option year exercised with a minimum qty of 40 per year. Offerors shall base proposals on the stated guaranteed minimum quantities for the purpose of a contract award. Any discounts offered based on quantities greater than the stated minimum shall be welcome but not considered for the purposes of the contract award. The contract award will be made to the top two submitted RFP&rsquo;s total average of the base year and all option years provided the proposals and the First Article has been designated technically acceptable. Schedule: Offerors shall submit a delivery schedule in accordance their anticipated monthly capabilities. Offerors should have the capability to overhaul at least the estimated maximum of 150 (per vendor) MT654 Allison Transmissions in accordance with Allison Standards within the prescribed contract year (max required 25 per month). Actual or perceived misrepresentations of the offeror&rsquo;s overhaul capacity discovered prior to or after contract award are subject to being deemed non-responsive or contract termination for the convenience of the Government. - Awarded contractor will also provide a weekly status report of the MT654 Transmission overhaul. The status report will include but is not limited to nomenclature, P/N, order #; qty left on order, qty at facility, lead time and estimated delivery date. Pick-up and deliveries will be made at the KS-Readiness Sustainment Maintenance Site (RSMS), Camp Funston-BLDG 1598, FT Riley, KS 66442. Technical: Offerors must submit a proposal that includes detailed information about their overhaul process as a requirement of technical acceptability standards to be considered for an award. A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP will be considered non-responsive. The OEM holds the proprietary technical specifications. This acquisition of services is restricted to qualified Allison Transmission technicians with the required tool pack for service and overhaul process in order to maintain the quality of the MT654 Transmission. Any offerors submitting a proposal without the appropriate qualifications will be dismissed without discussion as not being technically acceptable to the Government&rsquo;s requirements. Firms that recognize and can service the required item described above are encouraged to submit a proposal. - Mandatory replacement parts irrespective of MT654 Transmission Core condition (see attached). - Transmission will be painted (color and type to be determined). - Each overhauled transmission shall contain its own Dynamometer report. - Explain process required to overhaul the MT654 Allison Transmission from receipt of core to Dyno test and shipment back to KS-RSMS for technical evaluation of proposal. - The awarded offeror shall designate one overall Point of Contact concerning all aspects of this contract responsible for communication concerning quality issues and overall contract performance. - On time deliveries to include the ratio of successful inspected items in comparison with Quality Deficiency Reports (QDR&rsquo;s). An awarded offeror&rsquo;s expected learning curve shall result in less than a 5% monthly QDR report of which is averaged on an annual basis to assist in determining if option years will be extended. The Government recognizes and expects the learning curve to vary between offerors and is taken into consideration. Cost: The award will be determined by the offer that is Lowest Price and Technically Acceptable. A technically acceptable proposal is one in which the contractor meets all requirements listed in the solicitation. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal. For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented. - Delivery costs of the MT654 transmission shall be borne by the awarded contract offeror to and from the KS-RSMS and therefore offerors should take this into consideration when submitting a proposal. The proposal should include details concerning the shipping method of the transmission cores. The KS-RSMS will provide transmission cradles for the purpose of shipping to and from the KS-RSMS facility if requested in the proposal by the offeror. Returned Transmissions should be sufficiently covered or crated to protect the completed cores against miscellaneous damage. First Article: First article to be provided to customer (KS RSMS) within 15 working days of core pick up for evaluation. Successful inspection of first article by KS RSMS is required prior to award. The submitted proposal shall include the cost of the first article but this cost is not included in the final award determination. Any offeror that has previously performed this service for the KS-RSMS within the past two years in a technically acceptable manner is exempt from the first article requirement. First article approval will be in accordance with FAR 52.209-3 for which paragraph a-g will apply. Clarification of Standards: This overhaul procedure is required to return the MT654 Transmission to a FULLY SERVICEABLE condition IAW Allison Transmission overhaul standards. The transmission will be rebuilt to all OEM torques and settings; therefore items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation. This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement as needed. The mandatory replacement parts attached to this solicitation do apply (ref NMWR 9-2520-594). - It shall be the obligation of the offeror to exercise due diligence to discover and to bring to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the earliest possible time any ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies, or conflicts in or between the specifications and the applicable drawings or other documents incorporated by reference herein. The offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals. The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal. Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated; the proposal and/or award may be terminated for the convenience of the Government due to non-technical acceptability of Government requirements. Warranty: KS RSMS is requiring the awarded contractor(s) to provide a 1 year warranty from date of installation or 18 months from date of shipment from supplier (whichever occurs first) for each overhauled MT654 transmission core. The warranty will only be applicable to the workmanship and not misuse. If the transmission fails incoming inspection the KS RSMS will log the failure on a quality deficiency report (QDR) and contact awarded contractor(s) for corrective action. The contractor(s) must be able to service these units within the warranty period on-site within the Continental United States and should consider this factor when submitting a bid. Past Performance: Information should include a list of prior contracts for this item awarded within the past 3 years if applicable. The information shall include a valid point of contact, mailing address, telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. It is incumbent upon the offeror to include the most current contact information of prior contracts. Not doing so or having negative past performance with a previous vendor may cause the offeror to be found not technically acceptable and removed from consideration of award. - Past Performance while not a sole indicator of the offerors ability to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirement, it is still a consideration factor to assess an offeror&rsquo;s technical acceptability (i.e. the lowest price that meets the Government&rsquo;s technical requirement will be awarded). The responsibility of clarifying corrected past performance issues is solely incumbent upon the offeror. The final determination is at the discretion of the Contract Officer making the award. Proposed Deviations: If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the proposed deviation was made and what benefit accrues to the Government. All deviations should be accompanied with supporting rationale and clearly labeled "Deviation". An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation. (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.) The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an addendum identifying proposed deviations. Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such deviations may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award. Proposal Preparation Instructions: These instructions prescribe describe the approach for the development and presentation of the proposed data. The proposal shall include all of the information requested in the specific instructions. Failure to include all information requested may result in the dismissal of a proposal as non-responsive. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay costs incurred in preparation and submission of proposal information. - Proposal format is subjective to the offeror&rsquo;s preferred format that is orderly and sufficiently documented. Offerors are cautioned to submit enough information to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offeror&rsquo;s capability to perform all of the requirements for a fair and thorough evaluation. It is requested that the priced items of the proposal are listed separately on their own page. - All commitments made in the proposal may become a part of the resultant contract. The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate. Any materials submitted but not required by this solicitation, (such as company brochures), shall be relegated to appendices. Excessive reliance on promotional brochures is discouraged. Elaborate format and binding are neither necessary nor desirable. Submit proposals to the attention of CPT Robert M. Parvin, 2737 Kansas Ave, Topeka, KS 66611 or via e-mail at robert.parvin@us.army.mil not later than 2pm Central Standard Time on the designated response date listed in this Synopsis/Solicitation.

<p>3052.204-71 Contractor employee access.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS <br />(JUN 2006) <br />(a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: <br />(1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); <br />(2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated <br />by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); <br />(3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and <br />(4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures. <br />(b) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. <br />(c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine suitability.

Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. <br />(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. <br />(End of clause)</p>

In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved. <br />(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). <br />(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use.

S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State; <br />(2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U.

Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403).

North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services.  The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners.  Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts.  The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC.  This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor.  The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed.  It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment.  We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots.  Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: 
Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc)
The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support.   
These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options.  The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars.  
This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government.
Capabilities Package:  All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services.  Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services.  The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009.  
The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00.  We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions.  Points of Contact:  The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil.  All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team.

<DESC><p>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION. The U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center's XR Functional Capabilities Integration program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost reasonableness shall also be considered. Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 30 September 2012. This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 October 2012. The BAA technical areas of interest are for capabilities integration research work in the following areas: predictive battlespace awareness, information display and visualization, airborne networking, sensor systems and execution, data fusion and edge devices, information assurance and security, information management, cyberspace technologies, and other miscellaneous capability integration technologies. All questions may be directed to the technical contact points listed in Section V of the BAA.</p>

SB teaming; and/or Large Business (LB) subcontracting/teaming with SB(s) is acceptable; however, proven successful past performance "as a team" (either SB teaming with SB; or LB subcontracting or teaming with SB) working with the same firms/members on similar Air Force projects of similar scope and magnitude is required. Newly formed SB teams, or LB subcontracting or teaming with SB, without proven successful past performance on similar Air Force projects will not receive the same capability ratings as SB teams, or LB subcontracting or teaming with SB with proven successful past performance. Teaming arrangements shall be in compliance with applicable regulations.</p>
<p>(2) This SS/RFI is "unrestricted" because the SS/RFI posted Oct 09 did not generate an adequate number of qualified SBs. Response to this SS/RFI is strictly voluntary; however, qualified LBs and SBs interested in being considered for possible contract award "are" required to respond to this advertisement.</p>
<p>(3) This agency anticipates selection of up to six (6) of the most "highly" qualified firms to receive a Request for Proposal (RFP). Procedures identified in The Brooks Act; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6; Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 236.6; and other applicable FAR and DFARS subparts for award of Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services will follow.</p>
<p>(4) Of the six (6) most "highly" qualified firms responding to the RFP (issued only to the six most highly qualified firms), this agency anticipates award of up to four (4) IDIQ contracts.. .</p>
<p>b. Small Business Participation</p>
<p>Response to this SS/RFI is strictly voluntary; however, "qualified" SBs interested in being considered for possible contract award "are required" to respond to this advertisement.</p>

SB subcontracting plans will be an evaluated area. ***</p>
<p>d. Government Notice</p>
<p>Response to this SS/RFI advertisement is strictly voluntary. This advertisement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will occur. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of firms voluntarily submitting requested information in response to this SS/RFI.

<p>(e) Comprehensive Interior Design includes: Designing, selecting, and developing the loose interior building materials, finishes, special effects, and furnishings for an integrated visual design theme.<br /><br /><strong>c. Type of Contract <br /></strong><br />The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) IDIQ prime contracts to the most highly&nbsp;qualified firms to perform required services. Prime contracts will contain Firm-Fixed-Price, Time-and-Material, Labor-Hour, and Cost-Reimbursable Contract Line Items (CLINs). TO contract type is negotiable; however, it is anticipated most TOs will have firm-fixed-priced labor with cost-reimbursable line items, as required. Travel expenses will be pre-approved by the Government and cost-reimbursable. <br /><br /><strong>d. Cost Range, Limitations, and General Information<br /></strong><br />(1) Maximum contract guarantee for each IDIQ contract is $50K. <br /><br />(2) Cumulative ceiling price for all IDIQ contracts shall not exceed $25M. Ceiling price includes all TOs awarded against all IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>(3) Anticipated minimum TO awards is $25K.</p>
<p>(4) Anticipated maximum TO awards are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Environmental Planning - $1.5M</p>
<p>(b) Programming - $1.5M</p>
<p>(c) A-E Services - $1M <br /><br />(5) Maximum Fully Burdened Labor Rates (FBLRs) for each labor category shall be negotiated and fixed for the 5-year contract period. Travel shall be pre-approved by the Government and a cost-reimbursable expense. Other general cost information:<br /><br />(a) Up to six (6) of the&nbsp;most highly&nbsp;qualified firms will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP will require firms to complete a cost proposal workbook prepared by the Government in Microsoft EXCEL. The cost workbook identifies required labor categories and requires input of "base rates" for each labor category and "indirect rates" used to calculate maximum FBLRs. <br /><br />(b) The Government will evaluate each maximum "base rate" and "indirect rates" applied to the "base rates" to calculate the "maximum" FBLR for each labor category for years 1 thru 5. "Base rates" and "indirect rates" will be determined fair and reasonable, or negotiated to a fair and reasonable price, prior to contract award. <br /><br />(c) Profit is negotiable; however, profit proposed in excess of 5% is consider reasonable for "high risk" requirements, and services required for this acquisition are not considered "high risk."</p>
<p>(d) Requirement for payment of "maximum" FBLRs - The Government will pay "maximum" FBLRs only when contractor employees are paid the "maximum" base rate used to calculate the "maximum" FBLR. Reduced base rates paid to employees mandate reduced FBLRs proposed/billed to the Government. This requirement is mandated because "base rates" vary among employees performing the same services; therefore, FBLRs will vary commensurate with "base rates" paid to employees. Maximum FBLRs protect the contractor, and reduced FBLRs when applicable protect the Government from <em>overpayment</em> of profit. Example of FBLR maximum &amp; reduced calculations:</p>
<p>"Maximum" FBLR = $40.73 per hr <br /><br />Max Base Rate Awarded:&nbsp;&nbsp;$25.00 <br />Fringe (20%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.00<br />OH (25%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;6.25</span><br />Subtotal #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $36.25<br />G&amp;A (7%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 2.54</span><br />Subtotal #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$38.79<br />C.O.M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />Profit/Fee&nbsp; (5%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 1.94</span>&nbsp;<br />Max FBLR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$40.73*<br /></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Reduced FBLR&nbsp;= $35.03 per hr <br /><br />Base Rate Paid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$21.50<br />Fringe (20%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.30<br />OH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; 5.38</span><br />Subtotal #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $31.18<br />G&amp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; 2.18<br /></span>Subtotal #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$33.36<br />C.O.M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />Profit/Fee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; 1.67</span><br />Reduced FBLR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$35.03*<br /></strong><br /><em>*Indirect rates remain constant</em></p>
<p>(e) A nominal annual escalation rate may be applied and negotiated prior to award. The nominal escalation rate shall be based on historical averages.</p>
<p>(f) Firms proposing/billing escalated FBLR each year shall pay employees the "escalated base rate" for the Government to pay the escalated rate.</p>
<p>(g) Labor "vacancy credit" requirement - Labor "vacancy credits" shall be provided to the Government when a Firm-Fixed-Priced "full-time" contractor employee position is required and the position becomes vacant during the performance period. The vacancy credit begins the first workday the position is vacant and ends when the position is filled with a equally or higher qualified employee. All personnel replacements shall be pre-approved by the Government to ensure their qualification and experience are equal to or higher than the individual they are replacing.</p>
<p>(h) An additional G&amp;A expense may not be applied to travel and material expenses on this acquisition. G&amp;A fees are paid in the FBLR calculation.</p>
<p><strong>e. Period of Performance<br /></strong><br />(1) Prime Contract - Period of performance is 5-years from date of award. No options shall be included.</p>
<p>(2) TOs - Period of performance shall vary depending on the project. TOs requiring more than 12-months to complete will include options.</p>
<p><strong>f. Selection Procedures</strong><br /><br />Prime contract and TO awards will be made in accordance with selection procedures provided in The Brooks Act and applicable FAR and DFARS subparts referenced in Section I (a)(3) above. <br /><br /><strong>g. Significant Evaluation Factors <br /></strong><br />Firms shall be evaluated in terms of - <br /><br />(1) Professional Qualifications - Qualified firms shall possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services in all three task areas: <br /><br />(a) Environmental Planning (Environmental Impact Analysis Process and Base Comprehensive Planning),<br /><br />(b) Programming, and <br /><br />(c) Architect-Engineer Services. Primary technical services shall be performed by the Prime Contractor's "in-house" personnel who are credentialed members of architectural, science and engineering professions. The Prime Contractor may subcontract portions of the requirement to a credentialed professional (licensed to practice within the State where the task is to be performed) provided the Prime Contractor's Project Manager (PM) is a credentialed professional with the necessary expertise, in terms of knowledge and experience, to undertake the specified task (but is not licensed to practice within the State where the task is to be performed). Therefore, qualified firms must employ professionally qualified, experienced employees with a work history within the three (3) task areas who are professionally credentialed architects and/or engineers, certified planners (American Institute of Certified Planners), and Registered Environmental Managers (REM). <br /><br />(2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence - Firms shall possess specialized experience and technically competence in the three (3) task areas, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials; <br /><br />(3) Capacity - Qualified firms shall have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; <br /><br />(4) Past Performance - The prime contractor and/or team members/subcontractors&nbsp;(as applicable) shall have recent (within 3-yrs), relevant, successful past performance on similar projects in all three (3) task areas performed for the Air Force, other Government agencies, and/or private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. <br /><br />(5) Location - A firms location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project is a plus; provided application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and <br /><br />***<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Responses provided on the Questionnaire will be "cross-referenced" with proposal submitted by the six (6) most highly qualified firms selected to receive an RFP; therefore, ensure your responses on the Questionnaire are accurate and will match your proposal. Questionnaire responses that do not match subsequent proposal submitted in response to the RFP will "DISQUALIFY" your firm from possible contract award as Questionnaire responses are "part" of the evaluation criteria used to rank the six (6) most highly qualified firms. ***</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot National Forest, intends to acquire by contract the construction of an amphitheatre at the Johnston Ridge Observatory.  The work consists of constructing a 160 person outdoor amphitheatre to include Portland cement floor slabs, 500 linear feet of Portland cement walls, plastic/wood benches, electrical outlets, water spigots, approximately 450 linear feet of asphalt pathways, and reconstruction of approximately 400 feet of asphalt service road.

The project site can be located by traveling on Interstate 5 to exit 49 at Castle Rock, WA, and then east on SR 504 approximately 54 miles to the project location at the Johnston Ridge Observatory.  The Johnston Ridge Observatory is frequently snowed out by November 10 and as such it is highly recommended that those contractors interested in visiting the project site prior to submitting a proposal do so before that date.

The period for performance will be 60 days from issuance of a Notice to Proceed, which is anticipated to be issued on or about June 14, 2010.  The government will proceed to issue a solicitation utilizing FAR Part 15 procedures for Contracting by Negotiation.  This acquisition is 100 percent set-aside for certified HUBZone concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, past performance and other factors. A single contract will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.  

The estimated cost of construction for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. Performance and payment protection will be required for this project and Davis-Bacon wage rates will apply to any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on or about January 11, 2010.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.
<p>This notice consists of four parts:</p>
<p>PART I. INTRODUCTION<br />PART II. BACKGROUND<br />PART III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT <br />PART IV. HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals").</p>
<p>FAR Subpart 37.6, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) "A Guide to Best Practices for Performance-Based Service Contracting"(Oct. 1998), encourage agencies to use performance-based contracting methods that describe work requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work, establish objective measurable performance standards for key elements of the work, use a quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) to measure work accomplishment against the standards, and use performance incentives to encourage contractors to meet and/or exceed the referenced standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to take immediate action to govern the appropriate use and oversight of contract types to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts. OFPP's memorandum "Increasing Competition and Structuring Contracts for Best Results" (Oct. 2009) encourages agencies to collaborate with industry, use performance-based acquisitions, choose the best contract type for acquisitions, and use incentives to motivate lower costs in cost-type arrangements.</p>
<p>These referenced documents may be accessed electronically at the OFPP website located at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/</a>. Please frame any responses to this notice in accordance with the policies contained in these references.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customer Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides information technology (IT) services and products that enable ICE and DHS to meet their respective missions and to protect and secure our nation. In order to meet these goals, the OCIO has developed a number of critical IT initiatives that will help ICE modernize its IT systems, adapt and conform to modern IT management disciplines, and provide IT solutions throughout ICE. For additional information on ICE's mission see: http://www.ice.gov/about/index.htm</p>
<p>Because of the lack of precise specifications and difficulties in estimating costs with accuracy, ICE OCIO has historically used cost-reimbursement contracts when contracting for software development of IT systems. The cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract type is commonly used in software development contracts. CPFF contracts do not contain performance incentives based on the quality, timeliness, cost, or other elements of the work performed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to request information from interested parties, including potential Offerors, about the feasibility of alternative contract arrangements for software development, including:</p>
<p>&bull; The use of Performance-Based contracting <br />&bull; The structure and administration of contract incentives<br />&bull; The use of various contract types for software development projects, including Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), and Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF)</p>
<p>III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT</p>
<p>Information and comments are solicited regarding the following Discussion Areas:</p>
<p>Discussion Area 1: Performance-Based Contracting</p>
<p>1.1 Is there interest in Performance-Based contract arrangements for software development?</p>
<p>1.2 What benefits, problems and/or risks might exist in utilizing Performance-Based contracting techniques in the IT and software development arenas?</p>
<p>1.3 Do the benefits of motivating contractor performance with performance incentives outweigh the administrative costs and time burden to the Government and the Contractor?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 2: Measuring Performance</p>
<p>2.1 What are the key elements of the process of software development that are critical to successful outcomes and results?</p>
<p>2.2 What performance requirements, e.g., tasks and deliverables, are susceptible to measurement?</p>
<p>2.3 What standards can or should be used to measure unsatisfactory, satisfactory, and outstanding achievement of the performance requirements identified? What are the best sources of performance standards?</p>
<p>2.4 Should standards be expressed in terms of technical performance (quality), timeliness (schedule), cost control, or some combination of these parameters?</p>
<p>2.5 What surveillance and measurement techniques can or should be used to determine whether the standards are not achieved, achieved, or exceeded?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 3: Incentives and Contract Type</p>
<p>3.1 What types of incentives may be appropriate for use in software development efforts to motivate the contractor to meet and exceed the standards identified in Discussion Area (2)?</p>
<p>3.2 FAR Subpart 16.4 discusses two basic categories of incentive contracts, the fixed-price incentive contracts and the cost-reimbursement incentive contracts. Fixed-price incentive contract types include the fixed-price incentive (FPI) contract and the fixed-price with award fee (FPAF) contract. Cost-reimbursement incentive contract types include the cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract and the cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract. These four contract types focus largely on fee-based monetary incentives, and thus would have potential applicability and interest to the software development community currently working under cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) arrangements. Is there interest in any of these arrangements? If so, under what circumstances and how should the incentives be structured and administered? If not, why not?</p>
<p>3.3 What performance incentives using a mechanism other than fee would be feasible and would they be of interest to the IT community? Please discuss and comment on the award of additional periods of contract performance (known as "award term" contracts). <br /><br />3.4 Have software development projects been implemented successfully in a FFP, and/or CPIF/CPAF environment? If so, please explain. If possible, please provide samples.</p>
<p>3.5 What, if any, impact would the inclusion of performance incentives, FFP contract types, or other contract arrangements in future ICE software development contracts have on the decision to submit an offer?</p>
<p>3.6 Please discuss the possibility of breaking a Software Development project up into modules that could be priced as CPIF or CPAF for the initial phases, and transitioning to FFP as the "unknowns" become "knowns."</p>
<p>3.7 Please discuss problems that might be encountered utilizing any of the methods discussed, and provide suggested solutions or alternatives.</p>
<p>Discussion Area 4: Other</p>
<p>4.1 If you have Federal Government Points of Contact that have implemented a successful software development project using FFP, contract incentives, and/or performance-based contracting, we'd appreciate it if you'd share their contact information with us.</p>
<p>4.2 Would the IT community benefit from a public meeting to discuss the information submitted in response to this notice?</p>
<p>IV. HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>Please direct any questions concerning this notice to Ms. Miranda Collins at Miranda.Collins@dhs.gov, or 202-732-2549.</p>
<p>Please submit your information and comments, whether supportive or critical, to the Contracting Specialist electronically no later than December 22, 2009. Please submit the replies electronically to Miranda.Collins@dhs.gov. Electronic submissions should be submitted as an e-mail attachment in Microsoft Word. Please repeat each Discussion Area with questions and provide the response beneath. Please submit the information in the same order and using the same numbering scheme in this notice to facilitate evaluation and organization by Government reviewers. Please limit responses to 50 pages.</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The use of information received in response to this notice may be used by ICE for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. ICE will not critique the responses to this notice and the notice should not be used by Offerors to market their products/services. ICE does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with responding to this RFI. Proprietary information is neither sought nor desired by ICE. If such information is submitted, it must clearly be marked "proprietary" on every sheet containing such information, and the proprietary information must be segregated to the maximum extent practicable from other portions of the response (e.g., use an attachment or exhibit).</p>
<p>Due to the Federal Government closure on Monday, December 21, 2009, the due date is extended to 12:00 P.M. on December 22, 2009.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to questions received and extend the deadline for receipt of SF330 to 1/19/10 at noon PDT.SF330 Form, Formats, Page #s:Q46. The selection criteria for Specialized Experience states to provide a description of similar, recent Department of Defense (DoD) energy efficiency projects.  Can offerors provide energy efficiency projects consistent with the scope for other Government agencies and/or private industry on projects of similar size and complexity in addition to DoD projects?A46. Absolutely. DoD experience is desired; however, all recent, relevant experience will be considered and evaluated.Q47. The selection criteria for Specialized Experience requires identifying in matrix form which team members (teaming partners) worked on the projects.  Is this to be provided in Section F ? A47. Yes.Q48. The selection criteria for Specialized Experience requires (a) providing "an explanation of your management approach, an organizational chart showing inter-relationship of management and design team components, and specific quality control process" and (b) describing "your quality control program/process; identify who has the responsibility for implementation of the program, and discuss how you instill a culture of quality throughout the team."  Is it the Government's intent that these requirements should be addressed in Section F for each of the project descriptions provided?  And for this program in Section H? A48. YesQ49. Currently Selection Criterion 1 (Specialized Experience) states that only DoD projects will be considered relevant in Section F project sheets. However, Selection Criterion 4 (Past Performance) considers work with other government agencies and private industry to be relevant as well. Is this distinction intentional on the part of NAVFAC? If not, may we request a clarification indicating that Specilized Experience in Section F may include non-DoD projects?A49.  Specialized experience in Section F may include non-DoD projects.
Summary of Synopsis Changes:A.  The deadline for receipt of SF330 is extended to 1/19/10 at noon PST. All questions shall be submitted in writing via email to magdalena.evangelist@navy.mil and janet.harouch@navy.mil and maria.miller@navy.mil.B.  Selection criteria: 1) Specialized experience is hereby modified to include non-DoD projects.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): None<br /><br />The project consists of improvements of the existing south levee within the Santa Maria levee system. The south levee improvement project includes reaches 1 &amp; 2 that were awarded for construction in early October 2009, and reach 3 which is being considered for this contract. Reach 3 extends about 3.13 miles from Suey Crossing Bridge to Bradley Canyon Confluence. The improvements consist of construction of an 8-ft. wide and about 30-ft. deep compacted soil cement section along the levee riverward side slope and 50 to 62 ft. deep and 1,700 ft. long steel sheet pile along the levee at the upstream end of the soil cement levee portion. Construction of the compacted soil cement levee requires excavation of the existing ground to the approximate depth of 15ft. to 20ft. below the existing grade. Construction of 50-60ft. deep steel sheet pile does not require excavation of the existing levee. Improvements also call for removal, salvage and disposal of existing rock groins. Removal, disposal and installation of the levee signs, fences and gates are also needed for levee improvement. Resurfacing the existing 14 wide ABC levee road with the new 4 thick ABC is necessary for operation and maintenance. There are two existing single-cell (5X2) Reinforced Concrete Box (RCB) culverts, one 36 and one 48 Diameter Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP) that need to be extended, modified and included with the new outlet structures. Stone work consists of removal of existing 22 rock groins, salvage and disposal of the removed material at a designated site. <br /><br />The estimated cost of this project is $10,000,000 - $25,000,000.00.<br /><br />NOTE: This procurement is issued under full and open competition without exclusion of sources. When applicable, FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns will be applied to this action.<br /><br />ALL OFFERORS/BIDDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br /><br />ORDERING SOLICITATION: The solicitation will be available on-line on or about 18 December 2009. Plans and specifications will not be provided in hard paper copy.

<DESC>USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-S anticipates issuing an RFP no later than 26 Oct 09 for Air Terminal and Ground Handling Services (ATGHS) for Air Mobility Command at Kuwait International Airport/Abdullah Al Mubarak Airbase, Kuwait.  Services include, but are not limited to, providing all technical support, personnel, supervision, equipment, tools, materials and other items and services (except as specified within the solicitation as Government-furnished materials, equipment, facilities, services, and training) for all US Government owned or operated aircraft, US sponsored foreign Government aircraft, Coalition Forces aircraft, commercial contract aircraft, and tendered aircraft in support of the Department of Defense (DOD) Airlift System.  Handling of classified information will require the contractor to have a facility clearance after contract award and prior to contract performance.  Base Period is 1 Jul 10 through 30 Sep 10 and covers government furnished initial familiarization training at Charleston AFB SC and Ramstein AB, Germany.  Four one-year option periods will allow performance through 30 Sep 14. Performance in Kuwait starts on 1 Oct 10.  Source Selection Procedures will be used to evaluate offers and determine the best value.  Past performance and mission capability (staffing and implementation plans) will hold equal value and will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit at Kuwait International Airport is tentatively scheduled for the week of 8 Nov 09.  Actual dates and times will be posted as information becomes available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The San Antonio Channel Improvement Project (SACIP) Mission Reach Ecosystem Restoration and Recreation is located along eight miles of the San Antonio River in San Antonio, Texas.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the San Antonio River Authority are constructing fish and wildlife restoration features within and along the river.  The project begins at Lone Star Boulevard and continues downstream to approximately  miles south of Interstate Highway 410.  This reach of the river was previously altered to provide flood risk management.  The Mission Reach project will restore ecosystem functions and provide recreational opportunities while maintaining the existing flood risk management purpose.  Features of the project include restoration of pools, riffles, and runs within the river, reconnection of old river remnants, restoration of woodland and prairie plants, and construction of over eight miles of multi-use trail.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This is a modification to an existing contract task order. The Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to issue a task order modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds on contract task order W912DQ-04-D-0023. The project was originally competed under solicitation number DACW41-03-R-0068 and awarded to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc. (DUNS: 083535773). This is a remedial design task order modification. This is a funding only action for the Soils Remediation Action at the Cornell Dubilier Electronics Superfund Site, OU-2 (Operable Unit), South Plainfield, Middlesex County, New Jersey.<BR><BR>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this award notice of modification to an existing Task Order for the Soils Remediation Action at the Cornell Dubilier Electronics Superfund Site, OU-2 (Operable Unit), South Plainfield, Middlesex County, New Jersey. A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to an existing Task Order was used under Contract W912DQ-04-D-0023, Task Order 0011, which was competitively awarded. The modification award was $24,000,000.<BR><BR>The objective of this remedial action project is to remove PCB contaminated soil and buried debris treat contaminated soil using a Low Temperature Thermal Unit, dispose of contaminated debris off-site, and restore the site property for future development.<BR><BR>Procurement of a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee modification to the existing Task Order will offer significant flexibility for responding to contaminant conditions that are not well defined at the start of the project. Additionally, the USACE Cornell Dubilier project team is capable and prepared to provide qualified staff for monitoring contractor performance to mitigate risks and to ensure that all alternatives have been considered. The project team is also able and has experience to monitor the task order to ensure that performance, cost and schedule goals are being met, including but not limited to: implementing quality assurance procedures established for the contract, and completing timely contractor performance evaluations that accurately reflect the contractors actual performance.<BR><BR>Awardee Name and Address:<BR>SEVENSON ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
