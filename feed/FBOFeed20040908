<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to acquire professional services on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 from Project of Intermediate Advocates (PIA), Washington, DC.  The purpose is to evaluate the PIA workshops and outreach conducted at multiple locations for multiple audiences.  The period of performance shall be for six (6) months.

PIA teaches people with HIV and AIDS, health care workers, and working class people how to use the Internet to promote general health, HIV prevention, and HIV and AIDS treatment.  

Past evaluations of trainings have consisted of three instruments: a pre- and post-test administered immediately before and after the training, a workshop satisfaction questionnaire asking people to rate the usefulness of the curriculum and to explain how they would use it, and a post-workshop survey in 2002 that surveyed class participants to assess their identification and utilization of electronic health information related to HIV and other issues.

The purpose of this procurement is to conduct an evaluation of the PIA workshops and outreach using two methods – a survey and a focus group.  PIA will mail a survey followed by telephone calls to all people who register for the workshops.  A focus group of individuals who attend the PIA workshops will be convened to discuss the value of the workshops as well as other program activities of PIA.  The participants will be asked to discuss PIA’s program, including their recommendations for improvements.  

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for this research will be sought from the George Washington University Medical Center’s Board.  An informed consent procedure will be used to secure participant’s permission to be surveyed after the workshop.  The research team will include PIA staff, GWU faculty and a student, and a biostatistician.  Faculty from the GW School of Public Health and Health Services will provide support for study design and analysis, and apply for IRB approval.  PIA staff members will conduct the study and collect and secure the data.

PIA is uniquely qualified to conduct this evaluation.  PIA has conducted numerous workshops, training classes, and community information sessions.  PIA has records of those individuals who have participated in their workshops and, in the interest of privacy, does not wish to share those names.  PIA has ongoing relationships with the community they have been training, including both individuals who are HIV positive and community-based organizations serving this population.  They have an existing relationship with George Washington University School of Public Health staff members that have expertise in community health, public health, as well as evaluation.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).
 
This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) expertise in evaluation of health information programs, specifically programs that use electronic health information resources (35%); 2) specific experience and expertise with electronic HIV/AIDS health-related information resources and services and the development and provision of training in the use of such resources (35%); and 3) experience with health information outreach with consumers and community-based organizations in urban minority settings (30%).

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-252/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

Contact information for the SPO Program Managers (PMs) under each technical area is specified in Attachment 1. Bidders are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant PMs directly before submitting a response to this BAA. 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. 

SPO is developing technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities (UGFs), used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. In particular, SPO is focusing on both the detection and high-fidelity characterization of UGFs via a broad spectrum of sensing modalities and CONOPS. 

SPO is also investing in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, space control, innovative microsatellite concepts, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures. 

Novel platforms and sensors are also being developed to provide comprehensive global “tailored tactical surveillance” with dramatically reduced logistic tails. A key enabling technology is advanced, extremely lightweight, low-power density apertures suitable for large scale airship and space deployments. Additionally, novel methods are sought for providing wide-area, rapid revisit, high-resolution/sensitivity sensing and imaging that is required by the Warfighter, especially in the cluttered urban environment. Close-in sensing of underground and urban-embedded targets including building interiors is also being pursued. 

Investments are being made in technologies to provide full-scale protection systems against the threat of chemical, biological, and radiological weapons attack. In particular, SPO is initiating efforts to defend against radiological weapons (so called “dirty bombs”), and developing next generation, fast-acting chemical and biological sensors with high specificity and low false alarm rates. 

SPO is developing new technologies to support the entire spectrum of urban combat operations. Particular areas of focus include: ubiquitous and persistent precision surveillance including building interiors and thru-wall sensing; methods for detecting and mitigating asymmetric attacks including IEDs, RPGs, MANPADS, snipers, suicide bombers, weapons caches, and chem-bio weapons; and operational logistical support such as rapidly deployable and removable protection and barrier systems. 

Technologies are being pursued that allow precision navigation in GPS denied scenarios including jamming environments, building interiors, underground structures, etc. In particular, methods are sought that employ both natural and/or manmade signals of opportunity as well as novel, next generation INS technologies.

In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation. Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data. Attachment 1 provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest; bidders are encouraged to contact these POCs before submitting a response to this BAA. 

This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts that seek to address emerging threats or enhance the US ability to operate in challenging environments. 

PROGRAM SCOPE: The main purpose of this BAA is to provide exploratory funding to determine the suitability of an idea for further substantial investment. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 05 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available. Individual awards are expected to be shorter than 12 months and less than $1M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. 

GENERAL INFORMATION: In response to this BAA SPO is accepting white papers followed potentially by full proposals. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. To further reduce burden, it is suggested that the offeror directly contact the cognizant Program Manager (PM) by email (preferably) or telephone prior to submission of a white paper to ensure offerors ideas are aligned with DARPA/SPO needs. Attachment 1 contains a further detailed delineation of topic areas of interest as well as a list of cognizant PMs. For those submitting white papers, a PM most closely related to the submitted topic will review within approximately 30 days. A written response will then be sent to the offeror.

Those offerors submitting white papers are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page document.  The page count is instituted to minimize burden on the offeror and to allow for a review in the indicated time period. While larger submissions are allowed, we can no longer guarantee that they will be reviewed in 30 days. The white paper should clearly and succinctly articulate the key innovative ideas with sufficient detail to allow an expert in the field to assess its contribution. A Cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) summary (delineating labor, travel, ODCs, etc) must also be included.

Those offerors whose white papers are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. White papers and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available. 

Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/SPO Mission; c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; d) Offeror’s Capabilities and Related Experience; e) Cost Realism.

Awards will be made to those offerors whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government. All awards will be subject to availability of government funds. The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to make award without discussions. No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries. DARPA/SPO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. If a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. The point of contact for classified responses is the Director of SPO Security at 703-812-1984. Bidders who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response. 


SUBMISSION INFORMATION: The administrative addresses for this BAA are: Fax: (703) 516-7360 (Addressed to: DARPA/SPO, BAA 04-40), Electronic Mail: BAA04-40@darpa.mil, Mail: DARPA/SPO, ATTN: BAA 04-40, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. This announcement and Attachments 1 and 2 may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT & MARKET SURVEY This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Sections 3.2.1.3.12 and 3.2.2.4.  The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the decision to contract, in an amount greater than $100,000, via single source contract procedures. The FAA has a requirement for a contractor to supply â€œJet Aâ€ fuel on a single source basis for approximately 200,000 gallons to satisfy an immediate need with future acquisitions purchased via contract vehicle.  Past requirements were fulfilled through blanket purchase agreement arrangements with the Coast Guard.  This arrangement has expired and the FAA will satisfy their immediate needs via direct acquisitions until a multi-year contract can be awarded.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 324110 .  The anticipated base year contract, including four optional years will be in effect through fiscal year 2009.  BP Products North America, Inc. is the only known source with available access to pipe fuel to the storage tanks leased by the FAAâ€™s facility located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.  The FAA has an annual estimated need of approximately 350,000 gallons of fuel.  Other concerns who feel they have the ability to meet the needs of our requirement are requested to give written notification (including company name, telephone number with a point of contact) to the contracting officer listed in this notice, with reference made to market survey file # DTFAAC-04-R-00403, within 7 calendar days from the date of this announcement. Responses should provide information regarding the ability of your concern to satisfy the Governmentâ€™s requirement.  All responses to this market survey will be considered prior to further acquisition action by the Government.  Any information received as a result of this announcement will not be provided to other contractors and will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided in response to this announcement, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Responses and/or questions to this market survey shall be submitted in writing and directed to Michele D. Mustin, Contracting Officer, no later than close of business 15 SEP 04 at:  (405) 954-3030 (facsimile) or by e-mail: michele.d.mustin@faa.gov. This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA.  No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges by the FAA shall arise as a result of submission of responses to this announcement, and the FAAâ€™s use of such information.  This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: DOT, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<DESC>The Space Directorate at Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG/ZJ) has requirements to use terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products enabled with Crypto-Modernization (CM) features for replacing existing/legacy ground operating equipment (GOE).  Major goals and overarching requirements for this effort include the development and addition of space algorithm applications for terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products enabled with CM features.  The intention is to procure software/firmware development and a possible prototype.  A competitive contract(s) may be awarded based on all the requirements identified in the statement of work (SOW).  Beyond Fiscal Year 05, a spiral development approach for additional algorithms development, as well as implementation of space algorithm capabilities on additional terrestrial COMSEC product alternatives, is being considered.  A major goal of this program is to avoid equipment offered uniquely for space, as it is focusing on the installment and use of existing terrestrial COMSEC products for space application.  See Note 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for design of experiment (DOE) load schedule with restricted randomization for balances with a normal force limit above 3,000 pounds to substantially reduce the balance calibration time and cost. The restricted randomization component is crucial in that it provides a realistic load schedule. Once the restricted randomized DOE load schedule is developed and accepted, it will become the method for calibrating all balances at LaRC with normal forces above 3,000 pounds. The balance calibration for balances with normal forces over 3,000 pounds currently takes 4 to 6 weeks. From the first completed analysis, the unrestricted process reduced the time by 25%. The anticipated cost savings would be approximately $2500 per balance. The DOE balance calibration with restricted randomization would also provide: more robust data, a more rigorous statistical analysis of regression model quality, a reduction in unwanted system variability, and a better estimation of the matrices and uncertainties.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Florida State University.	They have on staff a recognized expert in the field of DOE with extensive experience with the current process to be analyzed and has already completed one analysis of the current standard balance calibration load schedule for balances having a normal force greater than 3,000 pounds. If the project is not successful projected savings will not be realized and less balance calibrations per year will be completed.  This is a continuation of a previous collaboration in which it was identified that using a fully randomized FSU derived Modified Box-Behnken Design, a 25% reduction in balance calibration time and a proportional cost savings was realized. The time and expense to find and evaluate whether another group meets the product quality, balance calibration knowledge, DOE experience and qualifications is not feasible. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 23, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the rental of one Six Degree of Freedom (6DOF) Measurement System to support the verification of the Dynamic Overhead Targeting System.  The requirement also consists of technical support for integration issues and for engineering support during the test runs. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item/services from Leica GeoSystems, Inc., pursuant to FAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons.  Leica Geosystems, Inc. is the only company with both the necessary precision and wireless walk-around Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM) with the capability to support dynamic measurements in the MSFC test configuration.  These tests require measuring Dynamic Overhead Targeting System (DOTS) tip position within the volume of the facility, and not a typical 4-6 inch CMM capability.  A collection of sensors will impact our ability to perform this verification now and our ability to reliably repeat verifications in the future.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below.  USAID has a long history of promoting justice sector improvements in Honduras since 1985.  For the 1997-2003 strategy period, USAID Honduras initiated the Strengthened Rule of Law and Respect for Human Rights (SROL I) activity.  The SROL I activity was designed to promote democracy in Honduras through support to key justice sector institutions and civil society. The objectives of the SROL I activity were: 1) a new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) effectively implemented; 2) an independent, apolitical and effective judiciary established; 3) an independent, apolitical and effective Public Ministry established; 4) broader civil society participation in justice sector reforms and monitoring; and 5) a changed mind set in the courts, in universities and elsewhere regarding the rule of law.  The activities under the SROL I activity are now being completed and will end in September 2004.
 
Significant change has occurred in the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new CPC, which introduced oral adversarial trials, more effective and transparent procedures, and greater protections for individual rights.  Nevertheless, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recognizes that numerous obstacles impede the effective functioning of the country’s legal system.  The judiciary in a democratic society must be independent of the Legislative and the Executive branches and therefore, not susceptible to improper political and economic influences from within the government and from private sector interests.  Changes in the institutional leadership that are subject to political interests threaten the reforms achieved to date and undermine the independence of key democratic institutions.  To improve the public’s confidence in its democratic systems and equal protection under the law, the Honduras justice system must strengthen its independence and protect itself from the influence of special interests that challenge the application of the rule of law.  Honduras has taken many important steps in reforming its justice sector, but further progress is required to address the rights of citizens to receive a fair hearing in court through a legal system that respects its own laws and regulations.
 
The current USAID Honduras strategy is entitled “Honduras Country Plan in Support of the Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy.”  The Country Plan was approved in August 2003 and sets forth the strategy of the USAID Honduras Mission for the period 2003-2008.  Under the new strategy, USAID/Honduras will build on the successes of the SROL I activity, particularly with regard to promoting inter-institutional approaches and developing a cadre of leadership for reform.  The new, 2-1/2 year SROL II activity will strengthen the momentum for reform within the institutions by improving the capacity of legal personnel, supporting the active engagement of professional associations to sustain justice reform, and focusing on the successful implementation of essential parts of the CPC and critical judicial independence issues.  The SROL II activity intends to increase respect for the rule of law, as well as its sustainability, by helping to deepen and diversify the constituencies that support ongoing reform.  The new activity will also introduce alternative dispute resolution as a means for increasing access to justice for marginalized groups as well as to provide another avenue to dispute resolution for commercial claimants.  Work will also support reform of the Civil Procedure Code, to introduce oral and more transparent and streamlined trial proceedings.  
 
The contractor will work closely with other donors involved in justice sector activities as well as with other USAID Honduras Strategic Objective Teams, particularly the Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO 2) in implementing activities supporting commercial claimants and civil court reforms.  One performance-based cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a 2-1/2 year period.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 24, 2004.

REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION:  The successful vendor shall engineer, furnish, and test (at vendor location) a reliable, high performance and secure HF communication network for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Regional Response Centers  and other Agency facilities.  The HF radio system will be capable of operating in the full HF band and support transmission/reception of voice and data traffic in fixed and mobile platforms.  Additionally, the vendor shall provide other capabilities such as remote control, phone interface to public  switched telephone network, and the scalability to establish a full performance HF network.  The HF equipment suite (Transceiver-modem-antenna and peripherals) shall provide high quality, reliable and secure voice/data/e-mail communication in the HF band (1.6 - 30 MHz) and amateur radio band with  the following requirements:  User friendly handset - provide access to all programming and procedures in a convenient and consistent manner.  The handset shall support diverse requirements ranging from traditional manual voice operations to sophisticated Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) calling  procedures and be Joint Interoperability Test Command (JICT) certified as compliant with MIL STD 188-141B specifications.  Programming - program channels, functions and addresses into the HF system.  Functions can be accessed via a series of configurable hot keys.  Built-in address book that can  store up to 100 addresses and up to 400 channels.  Computer Control and Interface - can be controlled by a computer through an RS232 port that will expedite user operations, communication handling, logging and other automated applications.  Data Communication - when equipped with modem should  support high speed data communication to provide data and e-mail capabilities.  System should have the ability to: 1) work with POP3/SMTP PC email clients; 2) provide message compression and batching, automatically resume interrupted file transfers, and automatically answer calls; 3) send files  directly to other stations; and 4) for text messages up to 90 characters, not require an external computer.  Phone Interface - ability to use existing agency phone system to connect to the HF system to make phone calls.  The radio/phone interface can be operated manually or left unattended to  provide fully automatic connection between radio and agency telephone network.  Any station in the HF network equipped with the phone interface may use the interface to make and receive local or long distance calls.  Additional requirements are high quality voice through in-built signal processing  and speed dial by pre-programming.  Remote Control - ability to remotely control the transceiver from another location.  The connection between the control point and the transceiver unit can be a single 2-wire leased line or radio signal.  Remote Diagnostic and Configuration - capability for  another radio station to measure parameters (e.g signal strength) and remotely update the transceiver configuration parameters through a text message sent from the control station to the remote station.  Security - include necessary encryption modules or software to provide communication security.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES on a sole source basis with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Sheps Center.  This acquisition is to develop a New 
Methodology for Mental Health Professional Shortage Designations.  The purpose of these designations is to identify areas of greatest need so limited resources can be prioritized and directed to those people and communities in greatest need and to determine which mental health professionals should be included in the calculation of the population to provider ratio.  The Sheps Center shall evaluate data on licensed mental and behavioral health professionals to determine the availability and reliability of the data, the appropriateness of inclusion in the formula for designations and the weightings for different types of providers.  The SHEPS center maintains all of the disciplines utilizing a consistent formula.  This formula cannot be overstated, as the burden of local jurisdictions would increase dramatically if different formulas were used.  The SHEPS maintains the data necessary to develop the mental health methodology and is the only organization that has the capability to interface the data and the knowledge and several propriety materials that directly relate to the necessary develop the new methodology. The Sheps Center is the only organization with the experience, proprietary materials and diversity of experience that is able to provide deliverables for the new methodology. Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of proprietary material and diversity of expertise would have to replicate their previous accomplishments. This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would be recovered through competition, therefore, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Shep Center, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.

<DESC>311 HSW and AFIOH plans to award a sole source contract under FAR 6.302-1(b)(2) to 454 Life Sciences Corporation, 120 Commerical St. Branford, CT 06405 for the following effort based on the corporations unique propriety technology that is able to completely sequence an entire bacterial genome in just days.

US Air Force in garrison and field units in the development and validation of biotechnology as well as molecular biology-based assays for the rapid identification of diseases, infectious biological agents and toxins.  This effort targets the preceding stage to the development of primers/probes for identification of infectious agents that is, mapping the genome of the latter.  The map provides the scientists at AFIOH a databank of targets against these infectious agents. Unequivocal identification of pathogenic microorganisms are of vital importance for medical diagnostics and exacting molecular assays are urgently needed by the Air Force Biological Augmentation Teams (AFBAT) in support of both operational deployments and homeland security. Established and well-characterized off-the-shelf microcantilever technology provides a multifunctional, highly sensitive, real-time, DNA-based and/or immunospecific biological detector.  This system provides numerous advantages such as: high sensitivity and selectivity, low analyte volume, real time detection in fluids and/or gases, and the possibility to create portable or implantable microdevices.  

SCOPE:

The purpose of this effort is to obtain bacterial maps using rapid sequencing of whole genomes in days as opposed to months by current standard methodologies.  One of the primary missions of the Molecular and Advanced Biotechnology Division at AFIOH is to support the development of real-time diagnostic platforms using PCR-based molecular diagnostic methods (i.e. JBAIDS). There is a paucity of genomic information on these species of bacteria and there is an urgent need to expand the repertoire of probes that can be designed specifically to target these species. Such probes are needed as real-time diagnostic tools to be deployed immediately to our troops in theater as well as homeland defense support.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806 has a requirement for a 40mm Grenade Launcher Module (GLM) as an approved Soldier Enhancement Program system  item.  Soldier Enhancement Program systems require a Commercial Off the Shelf(COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solution.  The system must be ready to use  or require only minimal modification (expected modifications are sight and  rifle/carbine integration).  The GLM will replace the M203 Grenade Launcher as a lethality upgrade in the emerging U.S. Army "Units of Action" and it will  also be fielded within the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). The GLM shall be more reliable, more ergonomic, more accurate and safer than the M203 Grenade Launcher. The GLM shall be capable of firing all current U.S. standard 40mm x 46mm low-velocity ammunition. It must have a breach mechanism that is able to accept improved lethality munitions with longer  payloads/projectiles than current 40X46mm munitions to accommodate system growth. The GLM must initially mount on the M4 Modular Weapon System with a  mounting architecture flexible enough for adaptation to the M16A2 and M16A4 rifle as well as future rifles/carbines.  The mounting hardware can differ for each host weapon; however, the basic launcher and sighting system must be able to mount to all host weapon variations with only minor modifications. When removed and replaced, the module will return to its normal bore alignment regardless of the host weapon interface. The GLM must have a probability of hit (within a 5 meter radius) of: P(H)_>.60 at 100m,>.50 at 200m_> .30 at 300m_>.20 at 400m. The GLM shall include a sight that provides day and night targeting and a secondary sight in the event the primary sight becomes inoperable separated from the weapon. The GLM system must have a range determination capability. Each GLM shall possess a stand-alone capability in addition to its role as a combination weapon. The GLM requirement will be met with a base contract of 60 systems for developmental testing to be procured in FY05. Contract will also contain two options.  The first option will contain quantities for 500 to 2000 systems and the second option will have quantities of up to 9000 systems. The contractor must be able to sustain a delivery schedule of 350 systems per month with a possible increase of as much as 1,000 systems per month beginning sixty (60) days from successful completion of First Article Testing. The offeror shall submit four (4) bid samples, in addition to written technical proposals, at least two must have a day/night sighting system and a range determination device.  All four will have an M4 MWS mounting configuration, a manual sight, and a stand-alone kit. The winning offeror must be able to deliver 10 of the 60 systems NLT 30 days from the date of award for safety certification/developmental testing. There shall also be a First Article Test (FAT) quantity of five (5) items that must be passed prior to approval of the first option. The Government reserves the right to waive FAT.  Proposals shall identify to the Government if the product being offered is a commercially available or a non-developmental item. Proprietary and/or classified information will be protected if requested with submission. A competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about September 24th,  2004. Proposals will be required within forty-five (45) days from date of  release of the RFP. Additionally, interested offerors shall be required to submit design interface drawings for the M16A2 and M16A4 weapon mounts, in accordance with the solicitation.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on a sole source basis with The Louisiana State University Health Science. 1501 Kings Highway, Shreveport, Louisiana  71103. 
This acquisition is for services to develop a toolkit for newborn hearing screening and early intervention for qualified providers.  The Maternal and Child Health Bureau asked the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) to develop a statement of competencies and equipment recommended for the diagnosis and treatment of infants and toddlers with hearing loss.  The JCIH is a panel of experts on hearing loss in infants.  The panel was originally convened by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  In 2002 they published a statement on infant hearing screening which has become the Standard adhered to both in the U.S. and abroad.  The statement of audiologic competencies is not available in draft and will be presented to the JCHI formally in late June.  The Louisiana State University shall develop a user-friendly document as a useful tool for state newborn hearing screening coordinators, pediatricians and other primary care providers. Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of proprietary material and diversity of expertise would have to replicate their previous accomplishments. This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would be recovered through competition, therefore, the Louisiana State University Health Sciences, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.  Written inquiries must reference Requisition Number HRSA 04-S240-0030.

<DESC>C—Architect Engineer Services Solicitation # GS05P04GBC0020- Toledo, OH
GSA announces that it has selected URS/Yazdani Studio of Cannon Design to negotiate a contract with for the New US Courthouse in Toledo, OH.
***************************************************************

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new Court House for the Federal District Courts in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction and infrastructure improvements. The building is approximately 20,500 gross square meters (224,000 gross square feet) including 35 interior parking spaces, on a Government owned site located within the Central Business District of Toledo, Ohio.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $60 million to $70 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: site and building design, metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Court House that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, indoor parking, site development, client program development, socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities and U.S. Marshals Service construction and security requirements, U.S.Courts Design Guide, as well as specific tenant-agency security requirements.  This building will be an anchor development in the neighborhood and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall urban design, quality of life and shall be consistent with the historic site concept of the Toledo Civic Center Mall.  The project will provide a facility that meets energy goals and includes sustainable design and construction practices (LEED). This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as defined as in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction for GSA.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ for Stage I. The Government may provide a stipend for Stage II (Charrette), which will be determined at a later date.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the Fed Biz Opps announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E’s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #3, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the-art Courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment. (3) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage the entire project team, including the A/E firms selected in the first stage, their designated Lead Designers and ALL the consultants who will work on the project will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  A brief period, approximately 3weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the Stage II project team, A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the state of Ohio.  The Selection Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan.  The Stage II evaluations will require an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board and will culminate with a one day Design Charrette on the day following the interviews. The purpose of the Design Charette is to further evaluate the design merits of each Designer’s “Vision”. The design Charette results will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firm. The Design Charrette results will be evaluated by a jury of GSA Peer Professionals. The evaluation criteria to be used by the jury shall include: community context, architectural strategy and image, courthouse functionality and sustainable design. The submitted design concepts become the property of the Government. Associated plans, drawings or specifications provided under this solicitation are intended for use by prospective bidders/offerors (and their subcontractors and suppliers). In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to building drawings/plans, security equipment, security equipment installations, and contract guard service, to include: 1) Limiting reproduction and/or dissemination of covered materials only to persons/parties related to this acquisition or otherwise authorized to receive such information; 2) Making every possible effort that is reasonable and prudent to prevent unauthorized disclosure of this information; 3) Upon award and completion of any appeals process, unsuccessful bidders/offerors making every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all information/documentation received during the solicitation and/or appeals process; and 4) The awardee continuing the efforts required above throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the “awardee”

Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to Small, small woman-owned, small minority-owned, small HUBZone, small Veteran-Owned, and small Service Disabled Veteran-Owned businesses.  The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II 255 and SF 254 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract.  The detailed plan is to be submitted with the SF-255 in Stage II.  Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project.

<SUBJECT>34 -- Machined Housing for a  Co-Conical Field Generation System

<DESC>This request for Proposal has been postponed till FY 05.  A new release date for the solicitation will be announced.


The National Institute Of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a commercially machined Co-Conical Field Generation System (CFGS) housing, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6-streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with far part 13.  The solicitation number is RA1341-04-RP-4032 and is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through federal acquisition circular 2001-24.  The NAICS code is 332721, and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Co-Conical Field Generation System (CFGS) is a set of expanding cones.   This machining contract will include the building a pair of cones, access doors, support structures, and alignment guides to test electromagnetic field and hazard probes.  The smaller (inner) cone will mount inside the larger (outer) cone with the alignment of the support structure then meet at the narrow tip in a microwave 2.92mm connector (specifically an Anritsu K-104F).  This system will be guiding RF energy from 10 MHz to 40 GHz. 
	The drawings shall be broken down into five major areas of design:  The Outer cone, (consisting of 8 major sub assemblies), the Inner cone (consisting of 5 major sub-assemblies), Outer Cone 2 and Door Assemblies, the CFGS Support, and the Inner Cone Support.  These drawings were designed using AutoCAD’s Inventor 8 – to get full usage of design requirements Inventor 8 must be used to view the design. The use of non-ferrous materials is absolutely critical in the inner surface of the Outer-Cones (Skin parts of Outer Cones 6, 7, 8, and 9) and the outer surfaces of the Inner Cones.  The required blends of aluminum must be adhered to.
	Critical machining issues: 
Outer-Cone: The inner surfaces of the Outer-Cones and mating surfaces between Outer-Cone sections a must conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.    
1)	Required Lathe – a vertical lathe with a minimum of 60” of travel will be required to perform the final finish cut on the outer cone.  Adjacent sections must be finished together to ensure a smooth transition between sections.  For the final passes the doors will be mounted in “outer cone 2” and need to be machined so the inner surfaces of the doors are flush with the inner surface of “outer cone 2”.
2)	Inner-Cone: The outer surfaces of the Inner-Cones and mating surfaces between Inner-Cone sections a must conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.    
3)	Outer-Cones 6, 7, 8 and 9:  The inner-surface profile is critical to making a smooth transition between a standard RF-microwave connector and the rest of the CFGS.  The AUTOCAD INVENTOR (*.idw) drawings in cfgs\outter cone\bessel cones have a defined profile that will be required during the machining process (not identified in the PDF version of the drawings).  This profile will be delivered in standard Machine-tool, CNC formatting in the distribution of the drawings – NIST will consult with contractor to determine actual format needed for the file to interface with the contractor’s available CNC equipment.
4)	Mating between sections:  the mating between sections of both the Inner and Outer Cone sections is critical.  Specification of the actual diameter of each section is less critical than the smoothness of the critical surfaces between sections.  Matched machining is required between sections to minimize this problem.   Adjoining sections must be mated together and final finish passes must be made together so these critical surfaces are smooth (the actual angle of the cones is not as important as the smoothness of the surface).
5)	Doors:  the inner surface of the doors must match the inner surface of the Outer-Cone 2. The mating specification on the top and bottom edges of the doors with the inner surface of Outer-Cone must be adhered to maintain RF performance.
6)	Note the dimensional tolerances on all drawings – These must be adhered to - surface finish and section mating are critical to system performance. 
7)	All bids must contain detailed processes on how the machining will be performed.  Bids will describe how tolerances will be held (with special notes on the mating of the door sections to “cone 2” and cone section to cone section interfaces).  Machine tools to be used must be listed, with accuracy specifications, to verify ability of the bidder to construct the system.  Details of machining and construction of the skin sections for outer cones 1 through 5 must be described to determine suitability for use in electromagnetic energy propagation (see design considerations).         
Design considerations:
1)	Skin construction:  NIST suggests using the appropriate thickness of aluminum plate then bend the skin sections into rough shape, weld together with upper and lower rings and perform finish machining on the interior surfaces and ring ends, but the design of the skin sections shall be left to the contractor.  Other methods will be acceptable to complete the outer cones including machining out of solid stock and casting if tolerances can be held.  Electromagnetic energy propagation will be adversely affected by seams and gaps between the skin sections.  Efforts to minimize voids or gaps in the welding will result in better performance of the system.  Final machining of the outer and inner cone sections must not expose gaps between the skin sections or voids in the welds.  
2)	For illustrative purposes – there is a directory \pdf which contains PDF version of the drawings for initial analysis and review by the bidders it mirrors the directory structure of the actual drawings.   The AUTOCAD INVENTOR drawings (*.idw) in the \cfgs directory are the drawings which will be used as the baseline for determination of compliance with the specifications.  The contractor should consider purchase of an AUTOCAD INVENTOR license to ensure that they can correctly implement all the drawings contained on the CD attachment to the solicitation.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below.  USAID has a long history of promoting justice sector improvements in Honduras since 1985.  For the 1997-2003 strategy period, USAID Honduras initiated the Strengthened Rule of Law and Respect for Human Rights (SROL I) activity.  The SROL I activity was designed to promote democracy in Honduras through support to key justice sector institutions and civil society. The objectives of the SROL I activity were: 1) a new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) effectively implemented; 2) an independent, apolitical and effective judiciary established; 3) an independent, apolitical and effective Public Ministry established; 4) broader civil society participation in justice sector reforms and monitoring; and 5) a changed mind set in the courts, in universities and elsewhere regarding the rule of law.  The activities under the SROL I activity are now being completed and will end in September 2004.
 
Significant change has occurred in the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new CPC, which introduced oral adversarial trials, more effective and transparent procedures, and greater protections for individual rights.  Nevertheless, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recognizes that numerous obstacles impede the effective functioning of the country’s legal system.  The judiciary in a democratic society must be independent of the Legislative and the Executive branches and therefore, not susceptible to improper political and economic influences from within the government and from private sector interests.  Changes in the institutional leadership that are subject to political interests threaten the reforms achieved to date and undermine the independence of key democratic institutions.  To improve the public’s confidence in its democratic systems and equal protection under the law, the Honduras justice system must strengthen its independence and protect itself from the influence of special interests that challenge the application of the rule of law.  Honduras has taken many important steps in reforming its justice sector, but further progress is required to address the rights of citizens to receive a fair hearing in court through a legal system that respects its own laws and regulations.
 
The current USAID Honduras strategy is entitled “Honduras Country Plan in Support of the Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy.”  The Country Plan was approved in August 2003 and sets forth the strategy of the USAID Honduras Mission for the period 2003-2008.  Under the new strategy, USAID/Honduras will build on the successes of the SROL I activity, particularly with regard to promoting inter-institutional approaches and developing a cadre of leadership for reform.  The new, 2-1/2 year SROL II activity will strengthen the momentum for reform within the institutions by improving the capacity of legal personnel, supporting the active engagement of professional associations to sustain justice reform, and focusing on the successful implementation of essential parts of the CPC and critical judicial independence issues.  The SROL II activity intends to increase respect for the rule of law, as well as its sustainability, by helping to deepen and diversify the constituencies that support ongoing reform.  The new activity will also introduce alternative dispute resolution as a means for increasing access to justice for marginalized groups as well as to provide another avenue to dispute resolution for commercial claimants.  Work will also support reform of the Civil Procedure Code, to introduce oral and more transparent and streamlined trial proceedings.  
 
The contractor will work closely with other donors involved in justice sector activities as well as with other USAID Honduras Strategic Objective Teams, particularly the Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO 2) in implementing activities supporting commercial claimants and civil court reforms.  One performance-based cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a 2-1/2 year period.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 24, 2004.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-7454, email: David.Krzysiak@afrl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support future Air Force networking, services, and information assurance requirements in the context of a Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a globally interconnected, interoperable, and secure system of systems for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. Leveraging commercial technologies and the potential for dual use by both the military and civilian communities are two additional aspects of this program. This activity is aimed at addressing the scale and complexity of a GIG which will provide new, end-user, multimedia, information services and support, distributed   command & control, intelligence, telemedicine and similar applications. These services and applications are vital to the Air Force mission to deploy and sustain forces anywhere in the world. To this end, the ability to send a wide variety of data across a global network comprised of communications channels of varying characteristics, in a secure, survivable manner, is of prime importance. An underlying assumption is that DOD communications will be derived from the commercial, national, and international fiber optic cable infrastructure. However, to reach deployed or airborne units, wireless extension of that infrastructure is necessary. Both terrestrial and satellite transmission systems will be required to support this extension capability and will also be inherent components of these deployed networks. In both instances, they will be required to support large amounts of information throughput. Candidate areas of technical research in support of communications networking, services, and information assurance technology for a GIG are: 1) Implementation and novel Extension of High Speed Large Scale Networks:  Effective implementation of networks to support a deployed Joint Forces Air Component Command and below. Efforts should address areas related to security and authentication, survivability and dependability, traffic management and traffic flow control, network management in a virtual network environment, mobile nodes and networks, self reconfiguring, and dynamic routing. Technologies to support network management will provide global management of the entire information infrastructure. Future management systems must provide for this overall management capability. This infrastructure includes numerous resources such as communications equipment, network switching equipment, distributed operating systems, and user applications. Encouraged are new and innovative ideas in management systems technologies including    visualization techniques, network emulation, artificial intelligence, and any other appropriate technology. Also encouraged is technology to provide specific management techniques for heterogeneous network environments, as well as cooperating management entities. Effective extension of network technology developments to provide launch points from high speed networks into highly constrained deployed networks.  2) Interoperability: For interoperability of an increasingly diverse set of transmission systems, work is encouraged but not limited to; development and demonstration of theater (deployed) fiber optic and high bandwidth RF (including satellite links) networking technology for high bandwidth communications between multi-media display systems that provide an interactive, common picture of battlespace to Theater and Component Commanders. The network should be scaleable, modular, survivable, secure, and provide for interoperability with global commercial communications infrastructure. Examples of enhancing the bandwidth capacity are: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), ultra short pulse Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) and a hybrid of such schemes. Examples of devices are: integrated transmitters and receivers, amplifiers, switches (SONET, ATM, Packet), synchronizers, frequency translators, filters, and routers. 3) User Network Services: The goal is to formulate innovative ideas for user services which use high bandwidth global networks, low bandwidth battlesite networks, airborne segments, and combinations of the these, experiment with them, and possibly develop promising ideas into demonstrable prototypes. Future services will provide the capability for day-to-day mission planning/execution in a distributed C2 coalition environment and assist commanders in making critical decisions in heavy stress situations. Past work in this area has centered around interactive, interpersonal communications services (workstation video windows, video conferencing, shared workplace graphics, multimedia presentation, multimedia conferencing, imagery dissemination) that provide the capability of collaboration among distributed users, both fixed and mobile. Also encouraged are new and innovative ideas for communications services which will support emerging technologies such as visualization and distributed virtual reality, and technologies which support new and innovative communications services such as data compression techniques or others. Also encouraged is work addressing the psychology of individuals and groups in the decision making process in distributed military C2 and the definition of new communications services which support that process. 4) Ultra-wide- bandwidth, multi-channeled, air and space-based communications networks on and between platforms:  Efforts should develop and define optical/electronic network architecture, system and subsystem (transmitter, receiver, switch, optical mux and demux, optical amplifiers, etc.) requirements for multi gigabit per second optical/electronic networks on-board air and space platforms and other AF/DOD applications.  Design and develop passive and active optical/electronic chip scale networking components (transmitters, receivers, switches) for Wave-length Division Multiplexing, RF, Code Division Multiple Access, etc. communications.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: David E. Krzysiak, 525 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY  13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-15-IFKA. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award.  White papers for FY 03 should be submitted by 15 Aug 03. White papers for the out years should be submitted as follows: FY 04 should be submitted by 31 Aug 03; FY 05 by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; and, FY 07 by 1 May 06. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in equal order of importance:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its analysis, (2) Related Experience -- The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and (3) Best Value --Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  White papers and proposals will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 to $1 M per award. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 03 - $150K; FY 04 - $2M; FY 05 - $1M; FY 06 - $1M and FY 07 - $750k. Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 03-15-IFKA.

Questions prior to the submission of a proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, telephone: (315) 330-7454 or email David.Krzysiak@afrl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition. A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."   These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for sole source commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subparts 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement incorporates commercial item provisions and clauses in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 339112 Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to Edstrom Industries, Inc. for their “Watchdog” Vivarium Management System.  Any parties that believe that they can satisfy the requirements below should send written documentation to Bonnie Pijanowski at VA Medical Center 3495 Bailey Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14215 (mail routing symbol 90).  All qualifications must be received no later than Tuesday, September 14, 2004.  According to VHA Handbook 1200.7.7b.(2)(c) : "at least annually, the IACUC tests the ability of facilities management personnel to properly detect and respond to elevations in animal room temperature by purposely overheating a temperature sensor, then noting the response." The following is a list of the new features required for this equipment: 1. Environmental Sentry Panel- a stand-alone microprocessor based monitoring system specifically designed for environmental monitoring, environmental data collection and storage, report generation and alarm communication. Provides user-settable alarm limits for environmental sensors 2. Sensor modules for each of the 19 animal rooms with temperature, humidity and light sensors in stainless steel water- tight housing. Watertight housing is essential because animal rooms have to be sanitized on a monthly basis to meet AAALAC and Central Office standards. 3. Power Supply with enclosure to protect it from day to day activities of a busy animal facility. 4. Electrical/Control cable to connect all components. 5. Speech/Modem for alarm notification and dial-in. System needs to be able to cascade calls to both engineering staff to fix the problem and also to VMU staff, to address the needs of the animals.  The system provides a maximum of eight telephone number sets, each set containing a maximum of three user-defined telephone numbers. A user-defined call map for each alarm condition. Use call map to dial phone numbers in sequence and announces the panel number and the sensor number in alarm. Allow alarm acknowledgement after speech message by entering a PIN number.  The call sequence is repeated until the alarm is acknowledged, or until the alarm condition ceases. 6. Watchdog Express Program to allow users to access the Environmental Sentry Panel remotely from a modem equipped PC. 7. The ability to tie into and monitor the Edstrom automatic watering system currently in use in the VMU. The Edstrom Monitoring System is essential to allow seamless functioning between systems.  It is also essential to insure continuity of the research projects being performed, particularly ongoing experiments so that there would be no changes in the way we provide for the animal’s care.  Monitoring of temperature and humidity in the animal rooms, and being able to react quickly to extreme fluctuations is now mandated by VHA Handbook 1200.7 and AAALAC, International for continued accreditation.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to determine if small and small disadvantaged businesses possess the necessary technical capabilities to support OPP's Health Effects Division (HED). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND/OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. NO TELEPHONE CALLS REQUESTING A SOLICITATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, A DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) IS AVAILABLE. RESPONSES SHALL NOT EXCEED 40 PAGES AND STANDARD COMPANY BROCHURES ARE NOT DESIRED. INFORMATION SHALL FOCUS ON THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES DEFINED BELOW. OPP develops data requirements and guidelines for the conduct of studies by registrants that are used, along with other data and information, to assess the potential impact of the use of the pesticide on human health and the environment. Before EPA can use studies and data in assessing risk, these data must be evaluated to determine their adequacy and validity and to ensure that appropriate quality assurance procedures were carried out. Once data have been evaluated and determined to be acceptable and valid, these data are used to assess risk to human health and exposure rates. The OPP requires support primarily in the area of review and evaluation of available data pertaining to the assessment of pesticides on humans. The OPP is responsible for the regulation of pesticides through the registration, registration review and reregistration of pesticides and assessment on humans, individual crops and crop grouping. 	The purpose of this requirement is to provide exposure assessments and relevant information necessary for EPA to fulfill the requirements of PRIA, FIFRA, FQPA, FFDCA the Pollution Prevention Act, and any other Executive Order or legislative requirement.  The specific objectives are to:  (1) perform technical reviews of pesticide human exposure studies and studies related to them, e.g., field residue studies; (2) provide technical support for registration and reregistration actions relating to occupational and residential exposure and risk assessments; (3) provide technical support in developing or revising Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Pesticide Assessment Guidelines for exposure studies; (4) evaluate worker protection issues relating to pesticide exposure and pesticide product labeling; and (5) provide other related technical support in the general subject areas of exposure and risk assessment and pesticides to the Health Effects Division of EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. The data requirements to support registration or reregistration are delineated in 40 CFR Part 158, Guidelines for Registering Pesticides in the United States 1982, Subpart N and other applicable documents which will require the ability to obtain appropriate security clearances. Appropriate Conflict of Interest (COI), Confidential Business Information (CBI) and FIFRA clauses will apply to these requirements. You are directed to the EPA Website under the Sources Sought solicitation number at "http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0412299/index.htm" for full details on this synopsis and the draft version of the SOW.  The anticipated level of effort for this requirement is 10,000 base quantity hours and 6,000 optional quantity hours for each contract period.  The government anticipates one base period with four optional periods. Vendors with the capability of providing services defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (40 pages) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirement. No resumes will be accepted.  Responses are necessary to demonstrate capabilities/expertise in all aspects of the SOW.

For questions, call (910) 251-4862 or write via internet, hilda.d.ay ers@usace.army.mil.  SF330 has two parts:  Part I Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II General Qualifications.  Although there has been a slight delay in the implementation, firms interested in the electronic submission of SF330 Part II will soon be able to submit it to the Business Partner Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov.  For a logon and passwork, firms will use their DUNS number and the Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) they selected when registering on the CCR web site, www.ccr.gov. Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF330 Part II to the BPN is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firm's visibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunitie s for contracts that are exempt from public announcement.  DO NOT SUBMIT A SF 254 OR SF 330 PART II TO THE ACASS.  ACASS will be modernized in late 2004 to retrieve the SF330 Part II from BPN and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until then, agen cies will require A-E firms to submit Part II with Part I when responding to a solicitation for A-E Services.  A Part II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms to submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if a firm has one on file in BPN.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at t he ACASS Center at 503-808-4590, or by e-mail at Marilyn.B.Nedell@usace.army.mil.  Use the help feature on the BPN for general questions about the use of BPN.        THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  The NAICS Code is 541330 with a small business size  standard of $4,000,000.  Response to this announcement should be in writing only; telephone clls and personal visits are discouraged.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Industry Day, Space Based Infrared Radar System (SIBRS), Mobile Ground Terminal (MGT) Environmental Control Unit Replacement (ECU-R)
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY:  Sponsored by the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 11, Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Program, Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, CO will host an Industry Day forum for the Mobile Ground Terminal (MGT) Environmental Control Unit Replacement (ECU-R) acquisition.  This event is scheduled for 5 Oct 2004, 08:00 am to 11:00 am Mountain Time (MT) at the Centralized Integration System Facility (CISF) in the upstairs Satellite Room.  Individual sessions with each contractor can be scheduled in the afternoon.  The address is 1050 East Stewart Ave, Bldg 2025, Peterson AFB, CO 90914-2902.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to provide interested parties and potential offerors an opportunity to receive information on the ECU-R acquisition and provide feedback.  Specifically, the forum will focus on presenting the Air Force's vision for the procurement.  The classification for the briefing is 'Unclassified'.  Attendance will be limited to five (5) personnel per company/team.  All notifications of attendance, list of names attending and phone numbers, and any questions regarding this announcement must be made by email by 4 pm MT, 1 Oct 2004 to David Starr at david.starr@cisf.af.mil. Visit request information must be sent into Diana Heineman, 719-556-2311, SMC Det/RM, 1050 East Stewart Avenue, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-2909. The FAX number is 719-556-2309. The current Environmental Control Unit (ECU) consists of an ECU Shelter, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment, and an ECU Control Panel. The ECU provides air conditioning to the MGT Operations (OPS) shelter only.  All elements of the existing ECU, including the neoprene bellows connecting the ECU to the OPS shelter, are to be replaced due to deterioration caused by aging and obsolescence of parts by using the latest in technology and brought up to compliance with current environmental regulations and standards.  The new ECU-R is required to fully satisfy and possibly improve on the existing ECU enclosure, functions, performance and control for operation at least through 2012.  Improved performance considerations include: near instantaneous startup under all weather conditions; possible use of redundancy to improve availability during component failures; improved electronics and cable shielding for survivability and endurability in case of High Energy Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) conditions; improved filtration in case of nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare conditions; improved power startup in order to prevent overload spikes opening protective circuitry in the power generation unit; and improved air intake to increase operating efficiency during cold weather conditions. The Government would like to explore the option of having the units built at the contractor plant and then installed at Greeley, CO without the need to drive the MGT to the contractor's plant. The new ECU-R (total weight including shelter shall not exceed 3,720 lbs) will mount in the same location on the MGT trailer within the same footprint and envelope (46 inches deep, 96 inches wide, 93 inches high) of the existing ECU with new or improved mounting required to satisfy shock and vibration requirements for mobile transport.  The current ECU Shelter is a modular enclosure that is constructed from a welded aluminum box frame with honeycomb panels for the walls, roof, and floor.  The current ECU shelter is mounted at the rear of the Semi-trailer directly behind the OPS Shelter and is secured by rigid platform brackets. The forward wall of the shelter is constructed with five duct vents to channel conditioned air to and from the air distribution plenum inside the OPS Shelter.  The air distribution system within the OPS is divided into three circuits.  Circuits A (42,000 Btu/Hr, 1000 cfm) and C (57,200 Btu/Hr, 1,370 cfm) support the Communication Subsystem (CSS) and the Digital Processing Subsystem (DPSS), respectively.  Circuit B (37,200 Btu/Hr, 860 cfm) provides conditioned air for the OPS shelter interior as well as supporting the mass memory unit and tape unit.  The current ECU shelter heater is integral with the air distribution system using electric warm-up and a damper controlled evaporator bypass supplemented with electric heat.  The current five ECU, and corresponding OPS Shelter, duct openings are connected by neoprene bellows.  Each of the hinged shelter doors is constructed with an intake and exhaust vent for circulating cooling and fresh air. The HVAC equipment is a simplex, closed-loop system incorporating extensive failure protection devices.  This equipment is integrated together inside the current ECU Shelter and is interconnected by air distribution ducting. Interested parties, who desire to be on the approved bid list and believe they have the capability of performing as prime contractors in support of this effort, are invited to submit a statement of capabilities, which includes the following information:  Personnel/Size Standard–(1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, (2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other and, (3) specific work experience previously performed or being performed relevant to the specific task areas of this effort.  Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate. The small business standard for this requirement is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710. Interested offerors must submit Statement of Capabilities (SOC) which clearly illustrates expertise in the following areas: (1) Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC), (2) Mobile HVAC and Shelter engineering, production, integration, installation, and test, and (3) Technical support (HVAC).  The SOC must also illustrate the offerors working familiarity with High Energy Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) shielding, reliability analysis and prediction, shock and vibration design, and environmental testing. The SOC must also indicate the contractor’s level of security clearance for performing work and having access up to the secret level and providing secure facilities for the MGT with safeguards up to the secret level.   E-mail your SOC statements to David Starr at david.starr@cisf.af.mil no later than 4 pm MT, 1 Oct 2004 which should be limited to twenty-five pages excluding resumes.  If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities, please indicate this clearly in your submission.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Verbal responses will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>--Kiosk Project for medical pre and post deployment.
<DESC>The U. S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street,  Fort Detrick, MD, intends to negotiate a follow-on SOLE SOURCE procurement with Vecna, Technologies.  The contractor will provide hardware and software and systems engineerin g for the automation and electronic capture of the medical pre and post deployment process at William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, TX.   Vecna Technologies has initiated work on this project and through no fault of their own, the location of the project as well as specific deliverables within the project have been changed to fit the business and clinical practice of the new facility.  The e xisting partnership has resulted in a working relationship with established agreements that would have to be redeveloped, incurring unnecessary loss of time and expense to the Government.  The current contractor is uniquely qualified in that they have alre ady begun working the integration piece for both systems.  Competitive bidding would result in significant project delays, would require duplication of cost to the government, and would not result in cost savings.  This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement under t he authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, statements of capability to fulfill this requirement received from other responsible businesses prior to close of business on 13 September 2004 will be evaluated.  Offerors responding to this notice must provide a statement of capability to the Contract Specialist.

The purpose of this aerial seeding is to establish desirable perennial grasses and forbs on upland sites which will out-compete the invasive exotic cheatgrass, and will help to provide greater soil stabilization and general watershed stabilization.   This treatment is planned to be completed by October/November of 2004, so that the seed will be on the ground, prior to prolonged period of winter snow cover. The seed will be ready to germinate when moisture becomes available and soil temperatures are conductive to germination.

<DESC>The Customs and Border Protection, McAllen Sector (McAllen, Texas) is requesting a firm-fixed price quotation for a Gold Elite Upgrade of Motorola Centracom II Plus Communications Console located in McAllen, TX.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  One contract is anticipated to be awarded as a result of this synopsis. 

RE:	Statement of work on the Gold Elite upgrade of a Motorola Centracom II Plus Communications Console in McAllen, Texas

1.0	Introduction

1.1	Background.  McAllen Border Patrol Sector Headquarters has plans to enhance its dispatch communications center with the Gold Elite upgrade of its Motorola communications console.  This will also require administrator, user and technician maintenance training.

1.2	The work to be performed shall be the successful completion, operational, and fully functional and optimized Gold Elite upgrade of the existing Motorola Centracom II Plus Communications Console.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and transportation necessary to complete the project.  The project shall encompass the following areas:

McAllen Sector Headquarters - located just south of the La Plaza Mall and adjacent to the Miller International Airport.  The address is US Border Patrol 2301 South Main Street McAllen, Texas 78503.    The communications console and central electronics bank is located at this facility.

Hidalgo Repeater Site –  Coordinates: Lat.: N26° 07’ 09”  Lon: W98° 13’ 32” located at the Southwest corner of the intersection of Jackson Road and Las Milpas Road in Hidalgo County.  This area is just West of Las Milpas, Texas.  Voting receivers will be installed at this location.

1.3	All materials and associated equipment shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer's installation, specifications, technical manuals, user requirements, and shall also comply with the latest Motorola Quality Standards for Fixed Network Equipment Installations, R56, Part Number 68-81089E50-0 and shall adhere to industry standards.  Motorola R56 manuals may be obtained directly through Motorola.  No deviation from the specifications shall be allowed without the expressed written permission from the Government.

2.0	General Information

The following information is a description on the functional programming and configuration of the existing Motorola Centracom II Plus Communications Console.

We currently have a five (5)-position console (four positions and one maintenance position).  It has a total of 27 active channels (27 Console Interface Units {CIUs} & MDC Signaling Base Interface Modules {BIMs}), virtually all used.  Our dispatchers use the corded headset jacks.  All five of our existing positions have analog phones connected to them.  We have five circuits that provide a ground to the console when low impedance is detected on the phone line.  We have the old Dictaphone call check recorders at three of the four positions.  However, we do have the new Dictaphone Freedom system recording all 27 channels and phone lines.  Our PCs are the original Vectra units that came with the console so they are almost 10 years old.

Our CEBS is comprised of seven equipment racks.  Racks 1, 2 & 3 are outfitted with Operator Module Interface (OMIs), BIMs, MDC Signaling cards, power supplies and small batteries.  Racks 4 & 5 are outfitted with 24 CIUs (T5007BX).  Rack 6 is outfitted with 3 CIUs and the maintenance position.  Rack 7 is completely filled with punch blocks (66 type).  Our five OMI position circuit cards are serial numbered as follows:

Position 1 - 228CTL0068  -  Position 2 - 228CTL0069  -  Position 3 - 228CTL0070  -  Position 4 - 228CTL0071 -  Position 5 - 228CTL0072

There is an approximate conduit distance of 550 feet between the dispatch consoles and the central electronics bank. 

We currently do not have any switching circuits on the console.  Our system is still running the old analog 12KB DES-XL.  We still operate with the old MSF5000 repeaters, System Saber portables and Spectra mobiles.

Statement of Work
Configuration Management Tool

1.0 	Scope:
This will be a firm-fixed-price contract with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) with five (5) one-year options exercised at the discretion of the GSA to provide software; software licenses; and associated implementation, training, and support.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor will furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities and otherwise do all things necessary to perform in accordance with the work set forth in the Statement of Work listed below.

2.0 	Technical Objective:
The technical objective of this task is to provide a standard Configuration Management tool to the U. S. General Services Administration (GSA) Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) using Rational change management products.  Along with providing the change management products, this task will also require associated implementation, training, and support.
3.0 	Background:
Since its inception, the GSA OCFO systems have evolved (and continue to evolve) through upgrades and modifications into a complex, nationwide network of automated capabilities for financial management services.  The OCFO architecture seeks to sustain existing services while introducing new user services as early as practical.  The first area of focus is the development of a stable hardware and systems software infrastructure with common operating systems and system services.  New financial management applications can then be put into place to enhance present OCFO capabilities.  As part of this infrastructure, a standard configuration management tool is required.

4.0	Statement of Work:

4.1	The Contractor will provide Rational software, and the necessary licenses, as the standard Configuration Management tool to the U. S. General Services Administration (GSA) Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO).

4.2	The Contractor will work closely with the GSA or GSA contractors to ensure the best configuration management solution is implemented.

4.3	The Contractor will review the GSA OCFO processes, procedures, and requirements and provide recommendations on which Rational products will work best with the GSA OCFO requirements.

4.4	The Contractor will develop and submit to the GSA OCFO an implementation plan to identify the timeline and requirements to smoothly implement the acquired software without causing any disruption to ongoing activities.

4.5	The Contractor will install the configuration management software to allow for multiple site access between GSA OCFO facilities in Kansas City, MO; Fort Worth, TX; and the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

4.6	The Contractor will work with the GSA OCFO to incorporate the various GSA OCFO Configuration Management processes and procedures into the acquired software.

4.7	The Contractor will provide training on all areas of the acquired software at each GSA facility identified in paragraph 4.5 above for approximately 30 to 40 students per facility.  This training will provide the government with the knowledge and skills required to operate and maintain the software.  Upon completion of the training, the participants will retain all instructional materials.

4.8	The Contractor will provide support on an as needed basis for a period of one (1) year to answer questions on the acquired software in terms of operation, tailoring, and troubleshooting.  This support will be in the form of telephone support between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. EST/EDT.

5.0 	Evaluation Factors:
An award will be made to the offeror whose quote is determined to represent the best value to the Government after consideration of the technical evaluation consisting of evaluation of a written technical quote.  A separate assessment will be made of the risk presented by each quote.  Concern with respect to risk may be the basis for rejection despite an otherwise favorable quote.  All quotes will be screened initially for timeliness, completeness, and accuracy.  This screening will constitute the Contracting Officer’s gross deficiency review.  A quote may be eliminated based on this gross deficiency review without further consideration.  The government reserves the right to award this contract without discussions or to award this contract with discussions with one or any number of offerors.  Additionally, the government reserves the right to down-select any offeror on this basis of a review of the technical factors, key personnel, or past performance.

5.1	Technical Evaluation Factors

5.1.1	Evaluation of Proposals

The technical evaluation will consist of a scored assessment of each proposal with respect to the tasks identified in the Statement of Work.  All eight (8) Task Areas are weighted at 12.5% each.  Although there are five (5) evaluation factors, only evaluation factors (1), (2), and (3) identified below will be applied against the listed tasks.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance with technical description being evaluated as significantly more important than cost/price.  During the technical evaluation, the factors will be evaluated either numerically or adjectively.

The five- (5) evaluation factors are:
(1)	Technical Description
(2)	Key Personnel
(3)	Past Performance
(4)	Risk
(5)	Cost/Price Quote

The weighting for the tasks will be applied when determining the numerical ratings for factor #1, technical description and factor #3, past performance, but will not be applied to the other three factors.  Factor #2 will be weighted as described in 5.1.1.2, Key Personnel, below.   Factor #4 will be rated adjectively.  Factor #5 will not be scored or rated but will be used to determine the overall best value to the Government.

As technical description, key personnel, and past performance scores become closer between offerors, cost/price quotes become more important.

5.1.1.1	Technical Description: The technical description includes: a) understanding the requirement, b) proposed approach and c) personnel.  The descriptions will be rated numerically on a scale of 1 through 5 with 5 being outstanding and 1 being unsatisfactory.  With respect to understanding the requirement, the technical description will be evaluated to assess the offeror’s understanding of the work to be accomplished including the task objectives, types of issues that must be addressed, and problems that may arise.

5.1.1.2	Key Personnel: Regarding personnel, key personnel will be described within the understanding of the requirement and approach.  The government must authorize any change in key personnel during the contract period of performance.  For the tasks listed, the key personnel will be evaluated numerically.  The contractor will completely describe the duties and responsibilities for key personnel in order to demonstrate their ability to perform the work identified in the Statement of Work as well as meet the key personnel position qualifications.  Quotes should include name, education, type and length of experience, and/or specialized skills.

5.1.1.3	Past Performance: For each task area the past performance will be evaluated numerically.  Past performance will be evaluated on the offeror’s work comparable or related to this effort.  Past performance with respect to GSA and other government agency software installation, training, and support will be considered as more important and will receive greater weight in rating the area of past performance.  Corporate history and personnel qualifications will be evaluated in determining past performance.  The weighting of the tasks described will be used in determining a numerical rating for past performance.

5.1.1.4	Risk:  Risk will be evaluated adjectively.  All quotes will have a risk assessment.  The following adjectival descriptions will be used:

5.1.1.4.1	High Risk: Great potential exists for serious work performance problems including, but not limited to, responsiveness, work schedule disruptions, quality problems, and substantial increase in contract costs incurred by the Government.

5.1.1.4.2	Moderate Risk: Some potential exists for work performance problems including, but not limited to, responsiveness, work schedule disruptions, quality problems, and/or a limited increase in contract costs incurred by the Government.

5.1.1.4.3	Low Risk: Minimal or no potential exists for work performance problems, including, but not limited to: responsiveness, work schedule disruptions, quality problems, and/or limited increase in contract costs incurred by the Government.

5.1.1.5	Cost/Price Quote: Cost/Price will not be rated.  Prospective offerors are forewarned that a quote meeting the solicitation requirements at the lowest price may not receive the award if award to the higher priced offeror affords the Government a greater overall benefit.  In such a case the superiority of the successful offer in areas other than price would justify the added expenditure.

5.2	Evaluation of Options

The Government will evaluate all offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.  The Government will consider the quoter’s past performance more important than price.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for one New Focus tunable laser source, model number TLB-6328-P, or equivalent.   Background: The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has requirements for a New Focus, model number TLB-6328-P, tunable laser source or equivalent.  The tunable laser source will be used to measure the responsivity as a function of bias voltage of semiconductor photodetectors over the wavelength range of 1520 to 1570 nanometers. In addition, the instrument will be used to carryout swept wavelength measurements to determine the relative responsivity spectra as a function of wavelength.  Furthermore, by modulating the laser current by an external RF signal, the AC response of the photodetector will be measured from which the usable 3 dB bandwidth will be determined. From the above set of measurements, we will obtain the optimum photodetector material/geometry that is essential for constructing an efficient high-speed chip-to-chip optoelectronic interconnect for which we are tasked. Specifications: The salient characteristics of the New Focus Tunable Laser Source, Model Number TLB-6328-P, are below.	The tunable laser source shall meet the below specifications: 1.	 Mode-Hop-Free Tuning Range = 1520 nm-1570 nm 2.	Minimum Power = 20mW 3.	Maximum Course-Tuning/Speed = 20 nm/s 4.	Course-Tuning Resolution = 0.02 nm 5.	Typical Wavelength/Repeatability = 0.1 nm 6.	Fine-Frequency/Tuning Range = 30 GHz (0.24 nm) 7.	Fine-Frequency/Modulation Bandwidth = 2 KHz 8.	Current-Modulation BW = 100 MHz 9.	Line width = &lt;300 KHz 10.	Output: Fiber Pigtail with FC/APC Connector Manufacturer:  New Focus Inc.	Model Number:  TLB-6328-P Delivery: Delivery of the laser shall be 4 weeks after receipt of order. **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: IF PROPOSING AN EQUAL ITEM, OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE SPECIFICATIONS**  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-24.

The newer row of HID lighting in front of the 6.9kV switchgear is to be replaced with 50Hz HID luminaires and the wiring completed. The older HID lighting in front of the engines is to be removed and the wiring also removed. The high bay lighting over the engines is to be replaced. The wiring for these latter fixtures is insulated with cloth which in poor condition, the wiring must also be replaced.
 
T-824 (LOX/Cryogenic Plant): The renovation project for this building is far enough in the future that we should go ahead and replace the four HID fixtures in this facility.

<DESC>This is amendment 0002 to this RFQ. This amendment answers additional questions from industry.  16. Q: In order to provide a reasonable level of effort, we would like to know how many exercises do you anticipate conducting each year and what type (classroom, table top, large scale, etc.) A: We anticipate one major CJCS sponsored relocation exercise per year, one table top exercise and quarterly drills for a total of six exercises.	17. Q: Would you consider exercise development on a part time basis with the individual(s) developing the exercise located at a contractor facility vice a government facility? A: Yes  	18. Q: Place of Performance; in one area it states work will be performed at a government facility and at the end of the RFQ it states Place of Performance as 701 S. Courthouse Road.  Is the Place of Performance 701 S. Courthouse Road? A: Yes  	19. Q: It is stated that parking is the responsibility of the contractor.  Does that mean if the  Place of Performance is at 701 S. Courthouse the contractor will not be able to utilize the lower parking lot? A: No, contractors can park in the lower lot or on the compound if they have a government sticker. If the contractor must be at a government site that has paid parking, the contrator is responsible for paying, and this expense will not be reimbursed.  	20. Q: In preparing the cost estimate for the various trips should 701 S. Courthouse Road be used as the point of origin for mileage calculations? A: Yes  	21. Q: In preparing the cost estimate for the various trips, will the option years have the same or similar number of trips per year? A: Yes  22. Q: Does Daily "maintenance oversight" include O&M and at what level (operator, systems administration, etc.)  A: It includes O&M at the SA level.  	23. Q: Will the network engineer work for the DISA IT department or be part of GO52?  A: The winning contractor's personnel will be assigned to support the DISA Mission Assurance & Continuity Program. If an innovative proposal is submitted that satisfies the statement of work and does not require a network engineer, it will be considered. 	24. Q: Will the network engineer reside at local government facility and travel to the COOP sites or will he/she be required to reside at one of the COOP sites?  A: It is expected that the NE will work at one site and travel to the others as required.  However, if an innovative proposal is submitted that satisfies the statement of work and does not require such contractor personnel placement, it will be considered.	25. Q: Is the on site and COOP Site support 24 hours a day 365 days a year or only during exercises? A. We anticipate contractor personnel will work normal work hours (7a.m - 4p.m.) Monday-Friday, except holidays, and that additional hours may be required to support exercises.  	26. Q: Is there sufficient space to possibly house 4-6 FTE's at the government site? A: Yes  	27. Q: The RFQ was listed as fully open.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT (PART 2)

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA has received requests for funding from the governments of Kenya and Tanzania for a number of feasibility studies in the port, airport, and rail sectors.  USTDA has also received several requests for funding from the East African Community (EAC) for regional projects.  The DM team will be expected to travel to Kenya and Tanzania to conduct a review of these projects.  

As part of the overall strategic efforts to expand and modernize their economies, member countries of the East African Community are individually and, in some cases jointly, putting emphasis on developing transport infrastructure to expand their trade capacities.  At the same time, USTDA has expanded its presence in these countries to support USG policy priorities in transportation security, aviation safety, and increased AGOA trade. The proposed definitional mission consolidates USTDA efforts to evaluate the more substantive leads received and identified in recent trips to the East Africa region.  

In Kenya, the DM team will scope various projects where USTDA could play a role in the transportation sector with an emphasis on port and rail projects.  It is expected that transportation security and expansion will be a focus of the team’s review of the Port of Mombasa.  The team will also follow priorities outlined by Kenya’s Ministry of Transportation and Communications through USTDA meetings with the Minister and a recent report outlining the Ministry’s priorities,  “Recommendations on Integrated National Transport Policy”.  The Minister’s report will be made available to the DM consultant team as background for the mission.  Potential projects include the construction of a new commercial port in Lamu, and establishing more intermodal linkages between airports, ports, and rail transport.  The team will also explore the Minister’s request for USTDA grant funding for a major regional rail project, a drivers’ education training center, and the consideration of changing its narrow gauge rail system to regular gauge.  Other areas of focus will be on transportation safety and customs facilitation, the latter working with the U.S. Regional ECA Hub and the Kenya Revenue Authority.  

Regionally, the DM team will be asked to investigate key corridor and Lake Victoria projects prioritized by the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat.  These projects will be assessed on the likelihood that they will attract implementation funding given the EAC’s inability to provide sovereign guarantees.  USTDA believes that there is strong project potential in its early but successful partnership with the EAC.  

In Tanzania, the DM team will seek to prioritize projects proposed by the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority, the Tanzania Airports Authority, and Ministry of Communications and Transport.  The team will also seek out other transportation opportunities.  For example, Tanzania has requested help to revitalize and expand their railroads to attract bidders when they proceed to privatize the national system.  The team may also consider infrastructure and security projects at the Ports of Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam. 

For each of the countries, the team will be expected to conduct a general review of several projects in each of the key infrastructure areas, but only provide a full analysis of perhaps 3-4 projects for each country (including the EAC region), if there are that many projects that would potentially meet USTDA funding criteria.  It would be useful for the team to outline the other projects that were considered and to give a brief status update and a reason why those projects were not selected.  Of the 3-4 projects selected for in-depth review in each country (or the EAC region), the team will determine whether it recommends those projects and then prioritize the projects for USTDA based on their urgency, how well they meet USTDA funding criteria, and other factors that would be at the team's discretion.

It is expected that the team would travel to Kenya—likely Nairobi and Mombasa, and to Tanzania—likely Arusha and Dar es Salaam.  Bidding teams should include a budget that reflects their travel and a draft schedule.

Finally, it is also expected that teams will submit bids that include equally strong aviation and port/rail expertise.  It is likely that this will require two experts to travel to the region.  East Africa regional experience in these sectors would also be helpful.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT (Part I)


Project Title:  Africa Regional (Kenya and Tanzania): East Africa Transportation Definitional Mission

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility studies or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative studies or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassies in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of each Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to Kenya and Tanzania to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassies.  The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassies upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

The Contractor shall submit a review of the financing options for project implementation, including an assessment of the overall cost estimate of the project and, for projects involving potential U.S. equity investment, the project’s proposed debt-equity structure to ensure that it corresponds to the requirements of the prospective lenders (this aspect is critical to USTDA’s decision making).  As part of this review, the Contractor is required to contact officials from the potential financing institutions, including, where appropriate, multilateral lending institutions, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and private/commercial sources, to assure that the project sponsors have adequately explored their financing options.  The Contractor shall provide names and phone numbers of contacts at the potential lending institutions and summarize their comments.  The Contractor must determine the most likely source(s) of implementation financing and ensure that the terms of reference for any proposed feasibility study fulfill the requirements of the most likely source(s).  

3.6		U.S. Export Potential (1-2 Pages)

The Contractor shall submit a best estimate of potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation.  This estimate should be supported by a breakdown by category and dollar value of goods and services likely to be imported for the project and an illustrative list of potential U.S. suppliers of the goods and services for those goods and services listed as likely U.S. exports.  A report of discussions with a reasonable number of U.S. companies that could be exporters, and their level of interest in the project, should also be included.

3.7		Foreign Competition (1-2 Pages)

The Contractor shall discuss the foreign competition for goods and services likely to be procured for project implementation by category, including a discussion of U.S. industry competitiveness in each category, taking into account geographic factors, local industry capabilities, technology and licensee issues, past procurement tendencies of the project sponsor, and how the procurement is likely to be conducted.
