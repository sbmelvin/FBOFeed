<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with 
New York officials, anticipates awarding up to 5 firm, fixed-priced, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennnis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the Spring of 2003, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to 113,125 host trees with an estimated 1,357,587 diameter at breast height (dbh) via trunk injection, 22,927 host trees with an estimated 291,903 dbh via soil injection and 1,304 host trees with an estimated 5,216 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees. ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Horsechestnut, Ash, and Poplar. This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified. Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer. Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by August 15, 2003.  Requirements contracts will be awarded 
to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required August 15th or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2003.  . The effective period of the contract will be from approximately May 12, 2003, or date of award, through September 30, 2003, with unilateral options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded on a month-by-month basis for a period not to exceed an additional 6 months.  The solicitation will be issued as a request for proposals (RFP) and will be released on or about March 28, 2003. Offers are due to the Contracting Officer by 11:00 A.M. Central Time, Monday, April 28, 2003, or as indicated on the RFP, whichever is later.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs, and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code: 115310.  Size Standard: $6.0 million dollar average annual receipts. The RFP may be downloaded off the Internet after March 28, 2003, or within 2 business days after the issuance of the RFP, from the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

The department has a complement of 89    FTEs.  The Procurement and Control Sections mission is to pu   rchase the drugs and other supplies that fulfill the needs o   f the approved protocols and to ensure that these drugs and    supplies meet all FDA and protocol standards.   b.) Specific Project   The current method of purchasing supplies from a vendor has    become a costly venture because numerous orders are placed e   ach month and a fee is charged each time the purchase card i   s used.  The Order Call Buys (OCB) program is a vehicle to a   llow the OPC, Clinical Center to place orders with a purchas   e card as often as necessary but only be invoiced for those    orders once a month instead of each time an order is placed.     This would save the Procurement Agent a considerable amoun   t of time and it would save the Department money because the    purchase card fee of $5 to $25 associated with each use of    the Government purchase card would only be charged once.  Th   is OCB program would be negotiated between the Office of Pur   chasing and Contracts staff (Simplified Acquisition Branch)    and each vendor to acquire the best cost to the government.    c.) Services and Supplies Required   Solutions and supplies are ordered approximately every 2 wee   ks from Baxter Health Care.    e.) Project Start Date   The estimated start date for the OCB program with Baxter Hea   lth Care is May 2003 pending negotiations between Purchasing    and Contracts Section and Baxter Health Care.   f.) Future Plans   We plan to expand this program for purchasing drugs and supp   lies from other vendors with whom we do a high volume or hig   h dollar business   Please email all questions and quotes to amcgee@cc.nih.gov

<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on a sole source basis Software Process Improvement (SPI) Services in support of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Norfolk, VA.  Specific areas of concentration to be addressed include, but are not limited to, the following:  Requirements Management, Software Project Planning, Software Project Tracking and Oversight, Software Subcontractor Management, Software Quality Assurance, Software Configuration Management, Organizational Process focus, Organizational Process Definition, Training Program, Integrated Software Management, Software Product Engineering, Intergroup Coordination and Peer Reviews.  While providing technical support in the above areas of concentration, the Contractor’s main focus shall be on enabling SPAWARSYSCEN Norfolk to be successfully assessed at Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3 Certification.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Commercial Item Services contract is anticipated with performance commencing on or around 01 May 2003 through 30 April 2004, with two (2) six month option provisions.  The Government intends to solicit on other than a full and open competitive basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, with Software Systems Quality Consulting (SSQC), 2269 Sunny Vista Drive, San Jose, CA.  No other firm will enable SPAWARSYSCEN Norfolk to achieve Level 3 CMM certification within the tight timeframe required without a costly ramp-up.  SSQC has previously provided training in CMM to SPAWARSYSCEN Norfolk utilizing actual software requirements, existing processes, existing infrastructure, and representative Command artifacts, and therefore has become intricately familiar with the SPAWAR organization and the efforts required to achieve CMM Level 3 certification by July 2004.  Additionally, SSQC is the sole developer and the only source of the “Hybrid Multi-Model”, the only known hybrid appraisal method that will enable SPAWARSYSCEN Norfolk to conduct CMM Level 2 and 3 activities concurrently thereby streamlining and potentially accelerating SPAWAR’s achievement of CMM certification.    

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within twenty-days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS code is 541512.

<DESC>This is published as a Sole Source announcement. The statutory authority that permits other than full and open competition for this requirement is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source modification to extend the San Diego Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) contract N00244-98-D-0065, for an additional 1 year period of performance, to SBC - Pacific Bell. The purpose of this contract extension is to continue uninterrupted, private Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) and data transport services for Navy and Marine Corps activities in the San Diego, CA metropolitan area and aboard Camp Pendleton, CA. This contract extension modification is for the period 01 Octobe r 2003 through 30 September 2004. SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only provider capable of providing uninterrupted service because the system currently in use (hardware, software, facilities and requisite technical expertise for providing and maintaining required services) is wholly owned, maintained, and secured by SBC - Pacific Bell in their Central Offices and outside plant infrastructure. Additionally: SBC - Pacific Bell retains the right to refuse other vendors access to their systems and cable plant; SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only vendor with existing facilities at all eleven Navy bases served by the SDMAN; SBC - Pacific Bell is currently the only source of the 7 digit telephone numbers supporting the Navy's unique 5 digit dialing plan and; the abbreviated period of performance would prohibit any other contractor from recouping the costs required for capital  investment. Therefore, because of the aforementioned factors, SBC - Pacific Bell is the only contractor capable of providing the required services continuously and without interruption.  The NAICS code for this action is 517110.

<DESC>The Agricultural Health Study (FIELD STATIONS).  The Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking contractors to perform the above named project.  This contract will maintain field stations for the prospective cohort study in North Carolina and/or Iowa.  A cohort of approximately 59,000 has been established in Iowa and 30,000 in North Carolina that can be followed prospectively for 10 years or more to obtain detailed information on agricultural exposures, diet, cooking practices, and other factors of etiologic interest for cancer and other diseases.  Field Stations shall be located in North Carolina and Iowa, states with population-based cancer registries and pesticide applicator registries.  The entire cohort will include farm owner/operators (approximately 53,000), their spouses (approximately 30,000), and commercial applicators (approximately 6,000 - all from Iowa).  A new questionnaire will be administered to the cohort under this contract to supplement questionnaire information previously collected from this cohort when it was assembled.  The types of support to be provided by the Contractor in the conduct of the studies include: study re-initiation and liaison, use of study materials (e.g., questionnaires ), CATI interviewing, other data collection (e.g, pathology records, death certificates), data preparation, data processing, drawing buccal “swish and spit” samples from selected members of the cohort in a non-clinical setting, study monitoring, quality control, and reporting/communicating recent research results to the cohort by direct mailings, website postings, and short articles in farm journals.  These tasks may vary.  Communication between the Contractor and NCI will often be on a daily basis with regularly scheduled conference calls to be held twice a month, and meetings with the NCI Project Officer in Rockville, Maryland every six months.  The Contractor must be capable of: administering a 30-minute CATI  questionnaire and achieve at least a 75 percent participation rate; linking the AHS cohort to the State Cancer Registry and Vital Statistics Office mortality file and the National Death Index to determine cancer incidence and mortality from all causes; and collecting buccal samples from a selected fraction (i.e.,approximately 1,250 samples per Field Station) of the cohort and subsequently sending the buccal samples to a designated laboratory.  Personal computers shall be used wherever possible for data processing and manipulation.  The NIH/DCRT computer facility (which has IBM computers) shall be accessed by remote terminals to be provided by the Contractor on their own premises if necessary.   In addition the contractors shall be required to perform the following options under the contract : (TO BE EXERCISED IF FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE)   Option 1:  Collect buccal cells from an additional 6,500 study subjects, using criteria identified by the NCI Project Officer. For budget purposes, each Field Station shall propose on a portion of the total 6,500, additional buccal cells to be collected,  prorated by the total number of study subjects in their state.   Option 2:  Collect tumor tissue samples from hospitals and clinic from up to 2,000 selected cancer patients for mutation spectrum analyses.  For budget purposes, each Field Station shall propose on a portion of the total 2,000 tumor samples to be collected, prorated by the total number of study subjects in their state. The protocol for sample tumor tissue will be supplied by the NCI project officer during the first year of the contract.  Option 3:  Validation of an additional 700 non-cancer disease diagnosis at each Field Station through medical records checks, which may include mailings and telephone calls to health providers identified by the study subject.  Option 4:  Transition costs for “add-on” studies.  Whenever an approved “add- on” study is about to be implemented by a federal investigator or extramural collaborator, the NIH IRB’s policy specifies that the initial contact with the study subject requesting participation in the “add-on study” be made by the AHS study team.  The Contractor shall provide Monthly Technical Progress Reports which shall include a monthly budget report, and a Final Technical Progress Report.  Other deliverables shall include computerized data, raw data, and biologic specimens.  The estimated level of effort, including all options,to be provided is 257,684 total direct labor hours for the entire period of performance for the entire cohort developed at all Field Stations.  Direct labor hours at individual Field Stations should be estimated in proportion to the number of cohort members that have been enrolled into the study in Iowa or North Carolina.  
 
The Contractor must meet the following three Mandatory Qualification Criteria at the time of receipt of Best and Final Offers (BAFO) for their proposal to be considered any further by the Contracting Officer:  1)  The Contractor must document that they have received authorization from the appropriate state official to access the cancer registry of North Carolina and/or Iowa for the purpose of matching the Agricultural Health Study Cohort to the registry on an annual basis.  2)  The offerors seeking the Field Station contract must demonstrate/document that they have a field office in North Carolina and/or Iowa with all the resources necessary to conduct this study by the anticipated start date of the contract.  3) The Contractor must document the willingness of  the state and local extension service and the state department of Agriculture, to support the activities enumerated in the scope of work of this RFP.  All responsible sources meeting these criteria are encouraged to submit an offer and will be considered by the National Cancer Institute.

The contract will be a cost-reimbursement, completion type for a 60-month period.  It is anticipated that the solicitation package will be available on/about April 15, 2003, with proposals due 45 days after the issue date of the RFP.  Award is anticipated by December 30, 2003. No collect calls will be accepted.  All requests for this RFP must be in writing or by fax.  The fax number is (301) 480-0241.

The General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to obtain land for approximately three (3) building sites within five (5) miles of the U.S. Border Station which is located at mile 1221.8 Alaska Canadian Highway.  This requirement is due to the security requirements of a rapid response time for the Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) Agency. The Government will consider either contiguous land or individual sites. Purpose: To set-up with utilities (water, septic/sewer, electric & phone minimum) sites to support three (3) new doublewide modular homes (approx 28? x 66?) for the housing of  BCBP families. Required: Land must have improved road access. Land that is offered must have concrete slabs installed by offeror, on which to place housing modules. Each site must have utilities installed by offeror to allow full hook-up. Offeror will be responsible for compliance with all required permits, zoning ordinances, and regulations. A preliminary title report and any existing environmental site assessment reports, soil reports, flood plain status, geotechnical reports, or other pertinent data must accomplish each expression of interest.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for WSR-88D Tower Inspection and Engineering Evaluation Services, Structural Repair and Replacement Services, Restoration of Galvanic Coating Services, Supplies and Materials, and Engineering Data.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded for a base year and four (4) one-year options.  GENERAL: The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) has support management responsibility for the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1998 Doppler (WSR-88D) weather radar systems for the tri-agency NEXRAD Program.  Part of the support management responsibility associated with these radars is the maintenance of the tower structure in a fully operational condition to ensure the mission of the tri-agency radar network can be continuously met.  Timeliness of tower repairs, both routine as well as catastrophic failure recovery, is critical to the successful completion of the NEXRAD tri-agency mission.   The NEXRAD program has deployed 158 operational and 3 non-operational (training, test, and repair) towers.  The design and engineering data for the WSR-88D Towers are the proprietary property of Valmont-Microflect (CAGE: 29189).  The WSR-88D Tower, its subsystems, and component parts are manufactured by Valmont-Microflect.   The Government does not have any technical information associated with the Tower except site unique as-built drawings.  Each site is unique and Valmont-Microflect has designated unique Tower drawing numbers for every WSR-88D site within these packages.   It is necessary to periodically inspect the soundness of the tower at all WSR-88D sites which are constantly exposed to the environmental extremes.   It may be necessary to conduct impromptu inspections of radar towers which have been damaged or suspected to have been damaged by a catastrophic event.  Additionally, some towers are located at remote mountainous sites with severe weather environments where the wind and ice loading are excessive.  These sites are only accessible at certain times of the year for a limited period of time and require frequent maintenance.  Timeliness of inspection and subsequent repair are critical in these situations to restore the WSR-88D tower to its original operational condition.  WSR-88D radars must be 96% operationally available in order to meet the diverse meteorological missions of the NEXRAD tri-agency partners.   SPECIFIC: This proposed IDIQ contract provides for initial WSR-88D tower inspection and engineering evaluation services.  Based on the results of these evaluation services, this contract will provide for the WSR-88D tower repair services for timely restoration of the inspected tower to its original condition, restoration of galvanic coating, and WSR-88D tower supplies and materials required for restoration of the inspected tower to its original condition.  Finally, the work under this contract provides for the delivery of WSR-88D tower engineering data and engineering change proposals resulting from any modifications to the documented tower configuration.  Although the Government does not require the use of OEM parts, offerors are required to declare in their proposal that either (1) they elect to use only OEM parts, or (2) they elect to use substitute equivalent parts.  Evaluation criteria are Technical Qualifications/Understanding (50%), Past Performance (30%), and Management Capabilities/Corporate Experience (20%).  All evaluation factors other than cost or price are significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This acquisition is expected to be awarded under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 811219 on the basis of full and open competition.  See Note 26.

<DESC>FDA intends to procure technical support for a research program titled Molecular Mechanisms of Developmental Toxicity and Abnormalities.  This effort will provide technical support directed at developing animal models for reproductive and developmental toxicity risk assessment.  Specifically, the current project focuses on defining the cellular responses to physical and chemical agents and their relationship to development endpoints used in the assessment of toxicity, extending the findings that have been developed in previous project.  This agreement will extend and expand on models for reproductive and development toxicity that have been developed in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration.  A sole source award is planned to the incumbent Charles River Pathology Associates International of Frederick Maryland.  Charles River is uniquely qualified to continue to provide technical support including bioassays aimed at defining organ, tissue and cellular responses and their potential involvement with developmental toxicity.  This will include the correlation of morphologic events related to malformations and growth retardation with alterations in cellular events that are important to normal development.  Any other contractor would have to ascend a learning curve that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the FDA’s requirements; also it would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE: Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Damir Sabol, Managing Director, Iskon Internet, Savska cest 41/X, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, ph: 011-385-1-6177-4444, Fax: 011-385-1-6177-012
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a national Internet build-out campaign for Iskon Internet of Croatia.

Founded in 1997, Iskon Internet, has evolved considerably over the past four years through outside financing, acquisitions, joint ventures, and rapid organic growth, particularly in the dial-up and lease line access business.  The company has also diversified into the portal and content business through iskon.hr and klik.hr, and into e-commerce applications through e-tours and EON.

From the outset, Iskon’s business model has been based on building a fast moving and flexible company from scratch. With its strong emphasis on customer service, Iskon has succeeded in creating a strong market presence and brand name, with initial corporate wins from dissatisfied HT customers. As Iskon has grown, it has become increasingly cost competitive through critical mass and focus on financial margins. 

In a recent USTDA-funded feasibility study, KPMG Constulting, Inc., conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the potential of fixed wireless technology to support last mile connectivity for Iskon. Such a solution would make Iskon less dependent upon HT and less vulnerable to cost or price shifts. The study found the technology to be viable from a cost/investment perspective, with the added advantage of bringing relief from dependence on a single local loop provider. Geographic features of the coverage area, the immediate bandwidth available to support existing customers, scalability of total bandwidth in the coverage area, and scalability of bandwidth per consumer, made the fixed wireless solution attractive from a technological perspective as well. However, at this stage, commercial services were only recommended for the city of Zagreb.  Tenders for this project have recently been issued, and it is expected that several U.S. companies will submit competitive bids for the project’s implementation.
 
Iskon recently won a citywide license to operate on the 3.5 GHz frequency in Zagreb. The company has opted for a solution with a central hub and 3 sector locations. The current topology covers approximately 80% of the Zagreb business market.

For its next stage of development, Iskon Internet is seeking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by liberalization, and plans to transition itself into a full service telecommunications operator able to provide converged telecommunications products and services encompassing switched voice, voice over IP protocol, data, video, internet access, content, and value added services (including VPNs, web hosting, co-location facilities, call centers, etc.) 

To achieve these goals, Iskon will need to further develop its infrastructure, preferably in partnership with a company such as HEP, Croatia’s sole electricity provider, which has already deployed a fiber optic network. Iskon has constructed a 1 km link to the HEP network and is actively pursuing commercial relations with the company. A successful relationship with HEP would reduce Iskon’s required investment in network infrastructure by approximately 50% - from roughly $120 million to about $60 million. (While the current focus is on establishing a relationship with HEP, the possibility of partnering with VIPNet, Croatian Railways, ELKA, or another company(s), also exists.)

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $246,900 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  Iskon will contribute $50,000 towards the cost of this project in the form of in-kind and cash contributions to bring the total of this project to $296,900.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., MONDAY, MAY 5, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>ACC CONS/LGCA has a requirement for LMR replacement of Motorola wideband assets to a narrowband standard to meet the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) mandate.  ACC CONS/LGCA intends to purchase the equipment and maintenance from Motorola Incorporated, Hanover, Maryland, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). This is a sole-source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   The Motorola LMRs must be compatible with equipment currently in use at all ACC delivery locations stated in the attachment.  The frequencies of existing equipment may be compatible with other brands, but not for encryption, repeaters or reprogramming.  The technology used in the radios is proprietary to Motorola.  Award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling Air Force requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 8.404. This procurement is being awarded using a GSA Schedule. The equipment list/delivery locations  is posted under a separate attachment.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFP) for competitive quotes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing by mail, fax or email to Ms Lois Nicholson or  Ms Nora Ball not later than 12 NOON Eastern Standard Time on Thursday, March 27, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Janis Research for a 3He ultra-low temperature, high magnetic-field system. This system will be used in our laboratory at the University of Colorado to develop a fast, electron-counting ammeter and to benchmark the speed of molecular transistors.  The vendor will provide a complete, integrated cryogenic system able to cool electrical circuits to temperatures below 300 mK (0.3 K) in a magnetic field which can be controlled between 0 T and 9 T. The low-temperature high field region must be high volume and easily accessible as detailed below. The system will be tested before shipment and guaranteed to meet specifications when fully assembled. Vendor will provide detailed mechanical drawings of the system in advance and will provide amendments and make custom alterations. The vendor may perform these revisions at least once a week and up to five times.  The components of this system are as follows: 1) A 3He cryostat with base temperature less than 300 mK with the ability to control temperatures up 4 K and to measure temperature up to 300 K. 2) An integrated superconducting solenoid magnet with maximum rated field of 9 T.  3) A dewar to permit the cryostat and magnet to be immersed in liquid helium.  4) Electronics to measure and control temperature.  5) Electronics required to control the magnetic field.  6) Pumping station required to operate a 3He cryostat.  Additional specifications required to accomplish high-frequency measurements at low temperatures and high fields in our  laboratory are as follows: 1) The system must be operable in a room with 12 foot ceilings.  2) The low-temperature must be maintained for longer than 40 hours, without interruption.  3) The diameter of the region at low temperatures and high magnetic field must be cylindrical with a diameter at least 3 inches.  4) The cryostat must include 2 straight, unobstructed paths, between the region at 300 K and 300 mK, which are at least 40 mm in diameter. One these must provide access to the helium space of the dewar via an demountable flange.  5) The dewar must consume less than 0.25 Liters per hour of liquid helium.  6) The superconducting solenoid must include a region with low magnetic field above the high-field region (a cancellation coil), with a field less than 0.01 T but still within the low temperature region.  7) It is acceptable that a pump is required to cool the system to low temperature, but the low-temperatures must be maintained without the aid of a pump.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date April 11, 2003.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Resolve, 1255 23rd Street, NW, Washington D.C. for follow-on coordination of Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team Meetings for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).  NOAA Fisheries is mandated by amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to develop Take Reduction Teams for strategic stocks that interact with fisheries that have a high or intermediate level of incidental take.  These teams recommend a plan to NMFS to reach the goal of reducing commercial fishery/marine mammal interactions, and are reconvened during the implementation of the plan.   Resolve facilitated the initial Team meetings and is needed for the follow up assessment of the take reduction plan.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The applicable NAICS is 541690.  This action is estimated above the simplified acquisition threshold.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to address tertiary education in South Africa. The date of issuance is expected o/a February 18, 2003.  The restructuring of higher education in South Africa is anticipated to have a significant impact on Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs) throughout the country.  In this regard, the USAID/SA Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP) has taken cognizance of the need to enable higher education institutions, particularly HDIs to further the transformation agenda of the South African Government.  As a consequence, TELP II will focus on two critical areas at the HDI institutional level, namely (i) curriculum development and program and qualification design, with Quality Assurance and Promotion as a component; (ii) management and administrative development.  At the national level, the TELP II activity will support the Department of Education (DOE) in the policy development and implementation process, and in providing assistance on HIV/AIDS policy issues in response to DOE priorities. Under the anticipated 3 year contract, the contractor will be expected to provide long and short term level of effort technical assistance to the HDIs to (i) assist these institutions to design programs in accordance with the new academic policy; (ii) develop and implement quality assurance systems; develop and implement quality assurance systems; strengthen the management and administrative capabilities of staff.  The Contractor shall be required to provide support to the Department of Education at the national level in the implementation of policy plans reflected in the National Plan for Higher Education, focusing on ensuring that the transformation agenda of the higher education branch with the Department of Education is realized. The Contractor will provide technical assistance on HIV/AIDS policy issues to the DOE.  USAID anticipates awarding one 3 year cost plus fixed fee term type contract using full and open competition.  Offers are encourage from small businesses and minority serving institutions.

<DESC>Responses to questions received:

Questions and Answers:

The following is a list of commonly asked questions and their answers --- 

1.	Q: The solicitation stated “100% Small Business Set Aside;” does that mean the vendor has to be small business?
A:  Yes. We’ll only accept proposals from small businesses for this particular solocitation.

2.	Q: The class size reads 1 person per class. Will the class size/participations vary based on the Windows subject being taught?
A: There are a total of 16 people for the various training. 1 person for Crystal Report 8.5, 4 people for MS Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure, 2 people for MS Windows 2000 Network and OSE, 3 people for implementing MS Windows 2000 Pro and Server, 2 people for implementing and administering MS Windows 2000 DS, 2 people for administering MS SQL Server 2000 Database, 2 people for programming a MS SQL Server 2000 Database. The ‘no later than’ dates we listed is a tentative schedule of deadlines on the last dates for the courses to start. The ideal situation we are looking for is to have system set up in which all the classes would be reserved in advance, so that whenever the students call up for the classes, there would be slots open. 
     
3.	Q: Will the 27 Feb 03 due date be extended?
A: Yes. Due to the number of questions we received, the dead line is now 4 March 03.

4.	Q: The solicitation stated: “provide training vouchers in one day increments.” Is it preferred that each class be taught in one-day sessions?
A: No. Since the customer didn’t specify any special requirements on how long each class should last, we would only ask for standard industry practice. The daily vouchers are just tickets for each day of training.

5.	Q: The solicitation mentioned the last possible date for each class to be taught. Will the actual dates be set by contractor, by student, or by consensus?
A: The actual dates will be decided by the contractor as long as the dates meet the deadlines.

6.	Q. Can there be more than one person per class?
A. Yes. Class size is up to the contractor.  
      
7.	Q. Line 0008 listed training for MS SWL Server? Shouldn’t it be SQL instead?
A. Yes. It should be SQL.

Question 2:	(Ref: TDP for 5204574-6) 2907825 is missing.  Drawing 5365257 note 5 references 2907825.

Answer 2:	Drawing 2907825 is typo error.  It should be 2907625, Gearing Schematic.  A Change Notice will be generated to change Note 5 on drawing number 5365257.   Drawing number 2907625 is included in the original TDP provided on CD-ROM.

Answer 3:	Drawing 5204574-6 Note 60 does not reference 5365225.  It references TR 5365225 (Test Requirement) and is included in the original TDP provided on CD-ROM.  Drawing 5974768 Note 28 should reference TR5365225 that is included in the original TDP provided on CD-ROM.  A Change Notice will be generated to change to correct this discrepancy.

Answer 5:	Drawing 5204598 Note 6 does not reference 5974803.  It references 2907825, which as stated in answer 2 above should be the gearing schematic 2907625 which is included in the original TDP provided on CD-ROM.  A CN will be processed for this change.

	Drawings 5365257 Note 10, 5974768 Note 30, and 6736841 Note 8 do not reference 5974803.  They reference TR5974803.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.


Requested Response:  

Parties interested in providing pricing information for past conservation technical services need to respond by accessing the TspCost Web page on the internet.  The web address is http://tspcost.sc.egov.usda.gov/  or link from http://sc.egov.usda.gov Information and instructions for populating the database are shown there.

Please submit questions about this notice by sending an email message to: edward.biggers@usda.gov.  Questions may also be sent by U.S. mail to: Edward M. Biggers, Jr., Director-Management Services Division, Room 5221-S, 1400 Independence Avenue., SW, Washington, DC 20250.

Responses must be received by April 15, 2003.

<DESC>LOCATION CHANGE FOR MOCAS RFI PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE.

This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation that will be available at http://www.dfas.mil/aso/contract/ for the rehosting of the Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) System.  DFAS is contemplating a firm fixed priced contract vehicle. 

MOCAS is an automated integrated financial and contract administration system developed in the late 1960’s and enhanced over the years to maintain regulatory compliance.  The system has over 8,600 authorized end users from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other DoD components who access the system from locations worldwide.  MOCAS resides on a DISA mainframe at Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and consists of three separate databases (MOCH, MOCL, MOCG) that serve two regions; East and West.  Each database has its own copy of executables (programs) and job control language (JCL).  MOCAS consists of both interactive on-line and batch system processing.  The primary mainframe programming languages are COBOL and MANTIS.  There are other interfaces, mid-tier, and desktop programs that operate using a variety of other languages and that are critical to the overall functions and support of MOCAS.  There are approximately 1.8 million lines of code per database.  However, the code is, in large part, mirrored in each of the three databases. 

The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation or award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for any information received in response to this RFI.  Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked propriety will be handled accordingly.  Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.  

A presolicitation conference will be held by DFAS Columbus at 12:00 on March 31, 2003 at the: 

CONCOURSE HOTEL & CONFERENCE CENTER
4300 INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer all questions submitted prior to the closing date of this solicitation.


1.)  I wanted to know if my firm would have a competitive opportunity to win this contract if we have not had previous experience with document destruction services specifically?

If business entity establishment is less than two (2) years, provide related experience of key personnel. Past Performance shall be valued as acceptable, unacceptable, or neutral.

2.) May we use our past experience with much larger contracts that included recycling and document destruction services? 

Yes, if the experience is pertinent to this requirement.

3.) Do you have a sample of a past formatted quote on what the submitted quote should look like? If so, can you send a copy?

There is no mandatory format for the RFQ.  It should contain all information requested in the solicitation.

4.) Do we enter "New Business? for your question or areas to respond to past experience if we have no past experience?

If no past performance information is available the company should indicate this in their offer.

5.) Should my company utilize a subcontractor does the prime contractor need a security clearance as well as the subcontractor?

Yes, only if the prime contractor?s personnel intend to perform any services proposed under the contract.  The Contractor shall submit proof of security clearances and SSF 3237?s (12/02), U.S. Secret Service Contractor Personnel Access Form(s), for all proposed personnel at time of proposal.

6.) We currently have security clearances for our employees through the IRS, but we do not know if that meets your requirement for proof of security clearances and we do not know if the forms we submitted to them were SSF 3237's. Do you have a copy of SSF 3237 that you could provide or instruct us as to where we can obtain this form?

IRS security clearances do not meet the USSS security clearance requirements.

supplied at each of the different service locations? Also do you have the approximate size or holding capacity of these carts?

Each cart can hold approximately 25 burn bags (depending on how full the bags are).  The vendor supplies the carts.  When the vendor arrives they usually bring about 15 carts.  We don't use a set amount at any location, because it changes each time.  

8.) Do you have a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreements referred to under SCA Minimum Wages and Fringe Benefits?

No, The Service Contract wage rate and labor category will be available prior to contract award.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor under the Collective Bargaining Agreement to provide wage rates.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - NASA is seeking capabilities only from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for a future requirement.	NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to compete the formulation and implementation phase of the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) development for the Geosynchronous Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES) R Series project.  HES will provide improved atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles for weather forecasting.  Instruments will fly on GOES-R in 2012.	The acquisition of the HES will follow a phased development strategy and will include two major phases: Formulation and Implementation. The work completed under the Formulation Phase will provide a foundation for the future Implementation Phase and will be used as the foundation for the contract to be awarded following the successful Formulation completion.  During the Formulation phase, the Contractor will complete Systems Requirements Analysis, System Trade Studies, Systems Requirements Baseline and Conceptual Design of a HES instrument.  The HES is being developed to provide infrared and visible data collection capabilities for the GOES program series of geo-synchronous satellites to replace the current GOES Series Sounding instrumentation.  At a minimum, the HES shall be capable of Disk Sounding for temperature and moisture, severe weather/mesoscale sounding for temperature and moisture and shelf and coastal waters images.  In addition, the HES development goals require improved (from current operational capability) spatial resolution data collection of higher resolution than is currently available.   The following Trade Studies are expected to be performed by a contractor during the formulation phase:	1) Spectral Detection Instrumentation Methods vs. Wavelength Trade Study; 2) Back-up Imaging Mode Trade Study; 3) Pixel Size Trade Study; 4) Coverage Rate Trade Study; 5) Calibration Methodologies Trade Study; 6) Rapid Local Area Image Update Study; 7) Data Rate Trade Study; 8) Detector Thermodynamic Trade Study; 9) Degraded Instrument Performance Trade Study; and 10) Instrument Mechanical and Electrical Properties Trade Study. The Implementation Phase will cover all efforts required to complete the development of the GOES R series, detailing calibration requirements, test requirements, product assurance requirements including quality control and safety.  The specifications for GOES-R will be an evolving document updated after the Formulation Phase is concluded.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  At this time, only small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses are invited to submit capability statements for the purposes of assisting NASA determine the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the future solicitation of the Formulation and Implementation Phase for HES.	To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, no more than a one 1-page summary shall be affixed to the front of a capability statement submitted which identifies for the evaluator, by page and paragraph, your company's relevant capability specifically to the HES instrument Formulation and Implementation Phases.  It is insufficient to only provide general brochures or generic information.	Additionally, respondents shall provide to the Government the name, address, point of contact, and telephone number of at least three current customers in which similar research and development services have and/or are being provided.  Capability statements should not contain company-sensitive information.  Failure to follow these instructions will result in non-evaluation of submission. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  The SIC Code and Size Standard for this procurement are expected to be 8711 and $4.0M, respectively.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is expected to be DO-C9.  Two (2) copies of capability statements shall be submitted to NASA GSFC, Code 210.Y, Building 28, Rm. W115, Greenbelt, MD  20771, Attn: Lynne Hoppel (301.286.3035, E-mail: Lynne.C.Hoppel.@nasa.gov on or before April XX, 2003.  Questions regarding this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Lynne Hoppel at the E-mail address listed above.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation is seeking sources to manage and staff the Science and Technology Policy Institute in support of Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with requirements delineated below.    

 MANDATE AND GOVERNANCE 

As reflected in U.S. Code: Title 42 USC §6686 (herein referred to as “the Act’), Congress mandated the establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to be known as the Science and Technology Policy Institute (hereinafter in this document referred to as “the Institute”).  The Institute was established to assist the Executive Branch as it formulates federal policy involving science and technology by providing objective, high quality analytic support to inform policymakers.  The Act specified the duties of the Institute as follows:

Assemble timely and authoritative information regarding significant science and technology developments and trends in the United States and abroad.

Analyze and interpret the information referred to above, with particular attention to the scope and content of the Federal science and technology R&D portfolio as it affects interagency and national issues.

Provide, upon request of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), technical support and assistance for the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) and to committees and panels of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

Consult widely with representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions and incorporate, to the extent practicable, information and perspectives derived from such consultations in carrying out its work.

Please see FAR 35.017 “Federally Funded Research and Development Centers”, for qualification and policy regulations, http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

 SPONSORS’ CONCEPT OF THE INSTITUTE 

NSF and OSTP  (hereinafter referred to as “the Sponsors”) conceive that the Institute will operate as follows:    

*  While NSF is the primary sponsor of the Institute, OSTP should be viewed as its primary customer. In general OSTP will provide technical direction and oversight while NSF will provide business, financial and contractual oversight.

*  The Institute shall meet special research and analysis needs of is sponsors, whether short-term or long-term that cannot be met as effectively by using existing in-house or normal contractor resources. The Institute shall provide its sponsors with a network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization.
The Institute shall inform its sponsors and other government policymakers through the objective, independent, and high quality analysis and assembly of information, in contrast to taking advocacy positions.  

*  The Institute shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special long-term relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding their full confidence and trust.

  MANAGEMENT PLAN  

The organization that is awarded the contract to operate the Institute (hereinafter referred to as the “Contractor”) shall set up, provide the necessary space and equipment, support and technical personnel to establish and manage the Institute, as an FFRDC in accordance with the Sponsors’ concept for the Institute described above. 

The Contractor, through the Institute, will be responsible for planning and executing such research and analysis as the Sponsors may specify.  Such research and analysis may include quick-response, ad-hoc analysis and technical support, short-term studies (up to one month), medium-term studies (1-6 months) and long-term studies (more than six months). The Contractor will also provide staff and technical support for the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST”) and the National Science and Technology Council (“NSTC”), as deemed necessary.

*Development of New Analytic Methods and Tools

The Contractor will be responsible for hiring a certified public accounting firm to conduct: (1) annual financial audits of the operations of the Institute (and certify annual financial statements), and (2) all audits required either under OMB circulars or under the cost principles applicable to the Institute.  

    TASKS FOR OTHER THAN THE SPONSORS    

It is not the Government’s intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.  However, an FFRDC may perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act, or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector. 

  This is allowable, provided:    

* The task is consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the Institute as specified in the Act. 
* The Institute has received the prior written approval of the Sponsors. 
* Funding for the projects has been transferred from the funding agency or agencies to the NSF and added to the Institute contract. 
* The Institute and the sponsoring agency or agencies agree to fully disclose all aspects of the work being performed, including draft documents, to the Sponsors upon request.

  QUALIFIED OFFERORS RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS  

It is requested that qualified firms interested in supporting the Institute submit a statement of their capabilities to perform the work as described in this notice, this statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible, concentrating on substantive information essential for a proper review/consideration. The Government will not pay for the cost of response submission.  
 
  ELIGIBILITY QUALIFIERS  

As specified in the Act, the Institute shall be: (1) administered as a separate entity by an organization currently managing another FFRDC.

Qualified organizations must possess a broad interdisciplinary staff with backgrounds pertinent to the environment in which it is expected to operate.

Qualified organizations must be able to work effectively and in a timely manner with Federal organizations, institutions and personnel in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS

A.  The incumbent will advise NAS on the environmental soundness of its counter-narcotics (CN) programs, helping to ensure that best practices are being used, all host-nation regulations are being complied with, and all U.S. statutory or regulatory requirements are being met.

C.  The incumbent will also collect and analyze data concerning the detrimental environmental effects of the cultivation and processing of narcotics.  In addition, the incumbent will work with other members of the country team and with host nation authorities to develop programs to provide information and education about these effects.

D.  The incumbent will accompany visitors and local personnel on field visits to review eradication programs and the use of glyphosate and assist in briefings on these issues.

E.  The incumbent will support the country team by preparing environmental strategies for use with host nation counterparts.  The incumbent will also help host nation agencies develop and integrate environmental policy and CN policy.

Representative (COR).

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) system or emerging technology for a Portable Airfield Laser Lighting System (PALLS).  The AMB envisions this technology as a lightweight, man-portable system capable of being rapidly deployed and set up by special operations and Global Mobility Task Force personnel in austere locations.  The complete system should be as lightweight as current technology permits, make the most efficient use possible of requisite portable energy sources, and must be sturdy enough to withstand and provide sufficient airfield lighting in any adverse environment.  Ideally, the system would produce light of sufficient strength that it could be used as final approach lighting for landing aircraft in low-visibility conditions.  System must be both visible light and IR capable, providing both overt and covert operational capability.  System should be capable of being converted for use as permanent airfield lighting system in forward locations.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SPACE TECHNOLOGY (ST-8) NRA
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the "Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)-Based High Performance Computing for Space" element of the New Millennium Program (NMP) Space Technology 8 (ST8) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NRA-03-OSS-02 that was released on February 18, 2003.   Background:  NASA's Office of Space Science (OSS) issued NRA-03-OSS-02 for the NMP to solicit proposals for its ST8 Project flight validation opportunities.  The goal of NMP is to validate through flight in space breakthrough technologies that show distinct promise of being able to minimize risk of first use and reduce cost for future space science missions.  The NRA solicits proposals from prospective Principal Investigators (PI's) for advanced technology subsystem concept investigations that can be developed for flight validation in the 2005 to 2006 time frame on either an NMP-provided host spacecraft or a PI-identified accommodation for space flight.  [Note: For the purpose of ST-8, the NMP defines a PI as a Technology Provider who is the individual responsible for proposing a flight validation concept and for leading technology development, technology validation, and publication of results.  The PI works through their parent organization, partners, the NMP Office, and NASA Headquarters (HQ) OSS to achieve the flight validation experiment objectives.]  NMP characterizes a technology subsystem as one that can be flight validated in space as a stand alone experiment on a host spacecraft.  Each proposal selected for this ST8 Project and then down-selected at the end of a Study Phase will enter into a Formulation Refinement Phase.  At the completion of the Formulation Refinement Phase the technology subsystem concepts will be reviewed by a NASA OSS Mission Confirmation Review board, and if confirmed, will proceed to the Implementation Phase.  The ST8 Project is expected to provide a flight validation opportunity for multiple technology subsystems.	The ST-8 program is envisioned to be flexible enough to accept technology developments at various stages of maturity (entry TRL 3 to 6), and through appropriate risk reduction activities (such as requirements analysis, conceptual design, laboratory breadboards and pre-engineering models), advance the TRL of the component or subsystem.  The website link to view the NMP ST-8 NRA is: http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/NRA-03-OSS-02/index.html Partnering Requirement:  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the NMP ST-8 Program to develop a proposal and execute development and performance demonstrations of components and subsystems. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide components and subsystems. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential government, industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks.  Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1)  Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2)   Cost and Schedule Control:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3)	Facilities:   This criterion evaluates the proposer's facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.   All responses should be sent via email to: NASA Langley Research Center:  Gregory S. Manuel, G.S.MANUEL@LaRC.NASA.GOV and Jeff A.  Herath, J.A.HERATH@LaRC.NASA.GOV.  The due date for submission is COB April 7, 2003. Technical questions should be directed to Jeff Herath (see email/phone # below).  Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, 757-864-2473, m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov.  Partners are sought for the following technology area. Spacebased Computing Architecture with Time Redundancy and Distribution (SCATRD), Technical Point of Contact: Jeff Herath,  757-864-1098, J.A.HERATH@LaRC.NASA.GOV The long-term objective of this effort is the development of a space qualified COTS high performance distributed computing system and the demonstration of its effectiveness in enabling greatly enhanced on-orbit computing and data product generation capabilities. For this NMP ST-8 program we propose to develop a working SCATRD system, to incorporate at least 3 powerful computing nodes utilizing distributed computing.	Responses are solicited from potential NMP ST-8 program partners who can demonstrate the capabilities and experience to design, manufacture and test this type of advanced computing system.  Selected partners will be expected to work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform some or all of the following tasks:  · Design and manufacture the SCATRD system · Design of the distributed computing architecture · Obtain and analyze suitable integrated circuits · Perform initial functional tests · Assist with the integration of the system · Assist with environmental testing, evaluation and deviation resolution · Assist with demonstration of the system · Provide or assist in the procurement of flight opportunities· Perform field experiments and analyze data collected.

<DESC>COMBAT ZONES THAT SEE (CTS), SOL BAA 03-15, DUE:  05/13/03; POC:  DR. THOMAS M. STRAT, DARPA/IXO; FAX (703) 522-7161.  BACKGROUND:  Military Operations in Urban Terrain are fraught with danger.  Urban canyons and abundant hide-sites yield standoff sensing from airborne and space-borne platforms ineffective.  Short lines-of-sight neutralize much of the standoff and situation-awareness advantages currently rendered by U.S. forces.  Large civilian populations and the ever-present risk of collateral damage preclude the use of overwhelming force.  As a result, combat in cities has long been viewed as something to avoid.  However, modern asymmetric threats seek to capitalize on these limitations by hiding in urban areas and forcing U.S. Forces to engage in cities.  We can no longer avoid the need to be prepared to fight in cities.  Combat zones That See will produce video understanding algorithms embedded in surveillance systems for automatically monitoring video feeds to generate, for the first time, the reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting information needed to provide close-in, continuous, always-on support for military operations in urban terrain.  OBJECTIVE:  Combat zones That See explores concepts, develops algorithms, and delivers systems for utilizing large numbers (1000s) of cameras to provide the close-in sensing demanded for military operations in urban terrain.  Automatic video understanding will reduce the manpower needed to view and manage this monumental collection of data and reduce the bandwidth required to exfiltrate the data to manageable levels.  The ability to track vehicles across extended distances is the key to providing actionable intelligence for military operations in urban terrain.  Combat zones That See will advance the state-of-the art for multiple-camera video tracking to the point where expected track lengths reach city-sized distances.  Trajectories and appearance information, resulting from these tracks, are the key elements to performing higher-level inference and motion pattern analysis on video-derived information.  Combat zones That See will assemble the video understanding, motion pattern analysis, and sensing strategies into coherent systems suited to Urban Combat and Force Protection.  PROGRAM STRUCTURE:  Successful realization of the Combat zones That See objectives requires a relevant and comprehensive approach to design, architecture, research, development, integration, evaluation, demonstration, installation, and maintenance.  Rather than solicit a collection of related but independent projects that need to be massaged into a coherent system, it is the intent of the government through this BAA to contract with a single integrated team that is exceptionally qualified to carry out all aspects of the CTS Program.  The successful team will not only have the ability to perform exceptional research in the key technologies, but also to integrate, install, and maintain a system based on those technologies.  While this BAA outlines some of the minimal capabilities that such a system should possess, it is expected that the successful Offeror will craft a solution that combines additional capabilities of the Offeror’s choosing, with those described herein, to create a demonstrable system that provides a coherent, comprehensive realization of the CTS objectives.  GENERAL APPROACH:  CTS will develop and deploy a multi-camera video surveillance system that combines commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies with its own research products to realize the performance goals described herein.  A single CTS system integrator/development team will be chosen to design, develop, integrate, and demonstrate technologies for DARPA.  Sufficient resources must be budgeted to cover all aspects of this program, to include the provision of any necessary on-site personnel to maintain the system and install upgrades in the field.  The Combat zones That See Program will be developed in two stages, using a spiral process with increasing levels of complexity:  Stage 1:  Force Protection Configuration.  An initial (largely COTS) Combat zones That See capability will be rapidly developed in the Combat zones That See system integrator’s lab and deployed to Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  This deployed configuration will serve as a platform for concept development and technology integration.  Close cooperation between the user and developer is envisioned in order to tailor Combat zones That See technologies for force protection applications.  Extensive testing and evaluation of key technologies should take place using this testbed at Fort Belvoir.  The ability to track vehicles over extended distances using fixed surveillance cameras separated by large distances is the central capability to be developed and demonstrated.  Once this configuration’s technologies have been sufficiently matured, hardened, and evaluated, it will be deployed to an overseas urban location for additional user interaction and evaluation.  Stage 2:  Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Configuration.  The MOUT Configuration incorporates the development activities and lessons learned from the Force Protection (FP) Configuration, plus additional technology to provide a Combat zones That See configuration optimized for mobile forces in urban combat settings.  Rapid deployment of a large video network is the central concept that differentiates the MOUT Configuration from the FP Configuration.  Additional capabilities for analyzing the derived vehicle track data should be developed and demonstrated.  Initial MOUT Configuration integration and development should occur in the Combat zones That See system integrator’s lab prior to deployment to Fort Belvoir.  Once the technologies have matured and the system has been hardened and evaluated, it also will be deployed to an overseas location for additional evaluation.  AWARDS:  One award is anticipated for design, architecture, research, development, integration, evaluation, demonstration, installation, and maintenance of all technologies developed in the Combat zones That See program.  Expected funding level is up to $4 million per year for 3 years.  Non-critical path tasks that can be cleanly separated as individual modules should be proposed and costed as options.  The contract will be incrementally funded by fiscal year, assuming identified milestones have been satisfactorily met.  Funding in the out years is subject to satisfactory evaluation of the Go/No go criteria as well as availability of funds.  Contract Mechanisms:  Awards will be in the form of Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Cost Reimbursement (CR) contracts, Delivery Order (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity), Cooperative Agreements, or Other Transactions.  Grants are not likely to be used.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/scientific/business decision process with technical and scientific considerations being most important.  Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria list in descending order of relative importance:  (1)  Quality and Technical Merit, (2) Relevance of Proposed Approach to Combat zones That See Program Goals, (3) Capabilities and Experience, (4) Offeror's Approach to Technology Transfer, and (5) Cost Realism and Value of Proposed Work to Government.  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which can be accessed at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/cts/index.htm.
