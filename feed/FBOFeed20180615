An update to this notice will be issued as soon as a date for the site visit has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Obtaining the solicitation:  The solicitation will be issued unrestricted to allow U.S. and non-U.S. firms to participate.  The solicitation and any technical exhibits (when applicable), which will include sketches and specifications, will be available for download from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov.  All notifications of changes to the solicitation will be made through electronics means only.  It is anticipated that the official Request for Quote (RFQ) for this procurement will be released on or about 15 July 2018.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a purchase order, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any quotation preparation costs.  It is the quoter's responsibility to check for any posted changes to the solicitation.  Vendors are encouraged to pay close attention to instructions outlined in the solicitation and pre-solicitation notice.</p>
<p>FBO/SAM Registration:  Potential offerors MUST register at https://www.fbo.gov in order to receive automatic notifications and/or changes to the solicitation.  The System for Award Management (SAM) is the official U.S. Government system that consolidated the capabilities of CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. Registration in SAM is required for a contractor to receive contract award.  There is NO fee to register on this website.</p>
<p>Immediate Changes in the SAM registration process:  The General Services Administration (GSA) has launched a new security measure (effective immediately) in the System for Award Management (SAM) which requires that every *NEW* or existing contractor registrant submits an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Date Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number before the registration will be activated.  The notarized letter requirement is mandatory for all types of registrants, US-based or foreign. It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and proactively maintain their SAM registration in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration.  More information can be found at https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/office-of-systems-management/integrated-award-environment-iae/sam-update</p>
<p>Recommend all offerors immediately check their expiration date of SAM registration. See the ALERT notice on the SAM home page for FAQ instructions on how to submit the notarized letter.</p>
<p>Construction Time:  Estimated construction time is 180 calendar days from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>
<p>Type of Set-Aside:  The applicable NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. This requirement will be solicited unrestricted to obtain full and open competition.</p>
<p>Contract Type:  The Government intends to award a single, firm fixed-price purchase order, for the construction of the warehouse described above.</p>
<p>Contemplating Awardees:  Since the contemplated purchase order is to be awarded by the contracting activity located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, USA and to be performed in El Salvador, the offerors must meet the following two requirements when contract performance will be wholly or in part performed in a foreign country:</p>
<p>(1) DFARS 252.225-7042, "Authorization to Perform" - The Offeror has been duly authorized to operate and to do business in the country or countries in which the contract is to be performed; and,(2) FAR 52.236-7, "Permits and Responsibilities" - The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any host government and political subdivisions laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.  Contractor shall provide copy of its certifications and permits with its proposal.</p>
<p>Contract Award Evaluation Criteria:  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from the solicitation to the responsible Quoter, whose quote conforms to the solicitation, and represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote.</p>
<p>Anticipated Award Date:  The anticipated award date for this effort is on or about 17 September 2018.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice MUST be submitted by electronic mail to the Contract Specialist at premilla.a.nored.civ@mail.mil AND a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer at velia.pier.civ@mail.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list.

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>

<SUBJECT>Use of electronic health information to assess the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S.
<SOLNBR>18-Q-68547
<RESPDATE>063018
<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), intends to award a sole source contract to the University of Michigan, 016-422 W NCRC, Ann Arbor, M5 48109-2800 to use the Clinoformatics Data Mart Database (OptumInsight) to assess the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. This database has insurance data from all 50 states and includes patient encounters (clinic visit, emergency room visits, hospitalizations), pharmacy data and laboratory information on over 61,796,000 individuals from January 2001 to December 2016.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.</p>
<p>A recent study by Rogers et al. estimated the incidence of T1D for all ages using a large electronic health information database (OptumInsight). This research demonstrated the feasibility of using this data source for incidence estimates of type 1 diabetes. The estimates for incidence of T1D among children and adolescents were similar to those found in the CDC's SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, providing support for this method of surveillance. This resource includes all 50 states, potentially providing state based or regional estimates T1D incidence. It is also important to track the incidence of T2D. However, the incidence of T2D using this resources is not available in published results. Published results of T2D will support CDC's national diabetes surveillance efforts to monitor the incidence of T2D for all age groups, by sex and race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan have experience in use of large electronic health databases for surveillance of type 1 diabetes and are uniquely qualified to perform this analysis This includes application of validated algorithms and identified type 1 diabetes cases. Since type 1 diabetes cases are previously identified, additional analyses to estimate the incidence by state and race/ethnicity can be completed more economically. Further, this also enables faster and more economical identification of type 2 diabetes cases. In addition, the researchers at University of Michigan have developed methods to estimate incidence within insured population and model estimates of incidence for the U.S. population as a whole. The purpose of this contract is to use a large electronic health information database to assess the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. This data base should include insurance data from all 50 states and include patient encounters (clinic visit, emergency room visits, hospitalizations), pharmacy data and laboratory information on over 60,000,000 individuals from January 2001 to December 2015. The Principal Investigator has shown considerable experience and expertise working with the OptumInsight electronic health information database, an electronic health information database available for researchers to use at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan is uniquely able to meet the objectives for this contract based on previous work and experience. In 2017, researchers at the University of Michigan used data from OptimInsight (Clinmatics) data to produce estimates for the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the United States for ages 0 to 65 year old. The researchers also used combined information from the OptimInsight data with U.S. Census based population estimates to produce incidence of type 1 diabetes for the U.S. overall and by Census regions. This project builds upon this work and expands the surveillance of incidence both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. The researchers at the University of Michigan already have access to the data and can rapidly implement the analyses needed to achieve the project objectives. The Principal Investigator has a strong history of using large electronic health information databases for epidemiologic research and surveillance. This experience is needed given the relatively short time line of one year for the project.</p>
<p>The MarketScan&reg; administrative database licensed by Truven Health Analytics was also considered for this project. While it is a large database of commercial inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims data from approximately 100 payers representing large employers, health plans, and government and public organizations, state coverage varies in the MarketScan data. State specific estimates are likely not possible. <br /><br />This contract involves the use of the data source to assess the incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. for ages 0 to 65 years. This builds on previous analysis by the Principal Investigator that estimated the incidence of type 1 diabetes by 5 year age groups, by sex, by U.S. region and by season. This contract will assess the incidence of type 1 diabetes by state and race/ethnicity and the incidence of type 2 diabetes by age, sex and race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of Michigan. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 18-Q-68547 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN June 30, 2018.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement</p>

<DESC><p>This agency proposes to add multiple NSNs from multiple FSCs to an existing long-term strategic/sole source contract. A total of 4 NSNs are currently targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source. However, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to General Electric at CAGEs 07482 and/or 99207. The proposed items are intended for addition to existing sole source contract SPE4AX12D9422 under award to General Electric, CAGEs: 07482 &amp; 99207 (IAW FAR 6.302-1). This is a Requirements Type Contract with approximately three (3) years remaining. The contract requires supply of parts as well as other functions including but not limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering maintenance, and design (control) affecting these parts. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort. Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM.</p>
<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by close of business July 30, 2018 and should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified.</p>
<p>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and the SBA PCR Michael Massello (michael.massello@sba.gov). Surplus dealers, small business dealers and distributors (having on-hand existing stock of surplus or newly manufactured material) are invited to respond to this synopsis. The<br />response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. The government may procure material or alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

An offeror will be determined technically acceptable if no exception is taken to the specifications and requirements of the RFQ. Award will then be based on price. Each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.

After evaluating price, award may be made to other than the low offeror, when the contracting officer determines it to be in the Government's best interest. Documentation is required detailing product offered unless offering exact items specified.<BR><BR>

If a project description does not clearly define the work performed by the Prime Civil Project Manager, including the specialized experience, or if the project does not provide the requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project may be evaluated less favorably.


CRITERION 3  PAST PERFORMANCE:

Firms will be evaluated for past performance of relevant projects with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.
 Evaluation of past performance will be based upon information provided in CPARS/ACASS or Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) for Criterion 1 relevant projects.  Customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criterion may be used in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:

SF330, Part I, Section H.  Submit a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation for each project submitted for Criterion 1.  If a completed CPARS/ACASS evaluation is not available, the PPQ (Attachment A) included in this notice may be submitted.  Do not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS/ACASS is available.

PPQs shall be completed by the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.
 PPQs shall not be completed by the prime contractor on a design-build project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a subcontractor.  Firms may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP as long as it is on the same form posted with this Synopsis.  Firms shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other AE services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

Firms may provide any information on problems encountered and the corrective actions taken on projects submitted under Criterion 1.  Firms may also address any adverse past performance issues.
 Information shall not exceed two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) in total.  If more than two double-sided pages (or four single-sided pages) are submitted, the Government will only evaluate pages up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.

The Government is not restricted to the information provided by the Firm and may use other sources to assess past performance, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and inquiries with previous customers/owners.  PPIRS will be evaluated for the firm that will perform the work and search will be based upon the CAGE/DUNS number provided for the firm.

Awards, letters of commendation, certificates of appreciation, etc.
shall not be submitted and will not be considered in the evaluation.

A subconsultants past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the JV partner(s).
