This data is collected through mandatory railroad reporting, voluntary reporting, and FRA and State inspection reporting. The data is comprised of accident/incident data, grade crossing inventory data, inspection and accident investigation data, and other plans and reports. The majority of safety data collected and managed via the RSIS program is regulation data. This data is mandated to be collected and maintained by the Office of Railroad Safety (specifically, FRA Chief Safety Officer) and has the specifics regarding format and submission method detailed through the rulemaking process.&nbsp; RSIS is comprised of a series of subsystems for housing and processing various data types with some integration across datasets. The principal subsystems include:</span></p>

NERC has identified several Districts within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as being owners, operators and users of the Bulk Power System and provided notification of mandatory compliance with the associated reliability standards. As a result of these notifications, the USACE awarded contract to BUSINESS PROPULSION SYSTEMS (U.S.) INC, to supply an enterprise level Compliance Management Software (CMS) application hosted by USACE. The CMS furnished by BUSINESS PROPULSION SYSTEMS (U.S.) INC, was the Resolver GRC Cloud compliance management software application. It is anticipated that a fixed price contract will be awarded.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.
